PART I ITEM 1.   BUSINESS GENERAL As used herein unless the context otherwise requires, the term “Company” means Koss Corporation and its subsidiaries, Koss Corp B.V. and Koss U.K. Limited. Koss Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1971. It formed Koss Corp B.V. and Koss U.K. Limited to comply with certain European Union (“EU”) requirements. Koss U.K. Limited is maintained to comply with certain U.K. requirements.  The Company operates in the audio/video industry segment of the home entertainment and communication industry through its design, manufacture and sale of stereo headphones and related accessory products. The Company reports its results as a single reporting segment, as the Company’s only business line is the design, manufacture and sale of stereo headphones and related personal listening accessories. The Company’s products are sold through U.S. distributors, international distributors, audio specialty stores, the internet, national retailers, grocery stores, electronics retailers, and prisons under the “Koss” name as well as private label. The Company also sells products to distributors for resale to school systems, and directly to other manufacturers for inclusion with their own products. International markets are served by domestic sales representatives and sales personnel in the Netherlands and the Caucasus region. The Company utilizes independent distributors in several foreign countries.  Approximately 84% of the Company’s fiscal year 2025 sales were from stereo headphones used for listening to music. The remaining approximately 16% of the Company’s sales were from headphones used in communications, education settings, and in conjunction with metal detectors, as well as sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”). The products are not significantly differentiated by their retail sales channel or application with the exception of products sold to school systems, prisons, and OEM customers. There are no other product line differentiations other than the quality of the sound produced by the stereo headphone itself, which is highly subjective. The Company sources complete stereo headphones manufactured to its specifications from various manufacturers in Asia as well as raw materials used to produce stereo headphones at its plant in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Management believes that it has sources of complete stereo headphones and raw materials that are adequate for its needs. There are no employment or compensation commitments between the Company and its dealers. The Company has contracted several independent manufacturers’ representatives as part of its distribution efforts. The arrangements with foreign distributors do not contemplate that the Company pays any compensation other than any profit the distributors make upon their sale of the Company’s products. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY John C. Koss is recognized for creating the personal listening industry with the first Koss SP/3 stereo headphone in 1958. The Company regularly applies for registration of its trademarks in many countries around the world, and over the years the Company has had numerous trademarks registered and patents issued in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, Africa, and Australia. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had over 400 trademarks registered in approximately 88 countries around the world and over 170 patents in approximately 26 countries. The Company has trademarks to protect the brand name, Koss, and its logo on its products. The Company also holds many design patents that protect the unique visual appearance of some of its products. These trademarks and patents are important to differentiate the Company from its competitors. Certain of the Company’s trademarks are of material value and importance to the conduct of its business. The Company considers protection of its proprietary developments important; however, the Company’s business is not, in the opinion of management, materially dependent upon any single trademark or patent.
Given the significance of the Company’s intellectual property to its business, in 2019 the Company launched a program to enforce its intellectual property rights and protect its patent portfolio. As part of this enforcement program, the Company has filed and pursued lawsuits against a number of companies that the Company believes have infringed or are infringing upon its patents and may enter into licensing agreements or initiate additional lawsuits. The Company considers protecting its intellectual property rights to be central to its business model and competitive position in the stereo headphone industry. ‎

SEASONALITY Although retail sales of consumer electronics have historically been higher during the holiday season, sales of stereo headphones are generally smooth throughout the year. Management believes that the Company’s business is not seasonal as evidenced by the fact that the Company’s net sales for the last three years, including the year ended June 30, 2025, were fairly evenly dispersed throughout the year. Management believes that the reason for this level performance of sales to retailers and distributors is related to the fact that consumers are increasingly purchasing stereo headphones throughout the year as replacements for older or lower quality headphones to improve the quality of their listening experience as it relates to portable electronic products. Therefore, upgrades and replacements appear to have as much interest over the course of the year as gifts of stereo headphones during the holiday season. WORKING CAPITAL The Company’s working capital needs do not differ substantially from those of its competitors in the industry and generally reflect the need to carry sufficient amounts of inventory to meet the delivery requirements of its customers. On a limited basis, the Company does offer 90-120 day payment terms to certain customers and may, on a rare occasion, extend payment terms to its customers for a special promotion. Based on historical trends, management does not expect these practices to have a material effect on net sales or net income. CUSTOMERS The Company markets a line of products used by consumers to listen to music, to work and study from home, to communicate via telephone or internet, and to listen to other audio-related media. The Company distributes these products through distributors and retail channels in the U.S. and independent distributors throughout the rest of the world. Additionally, the Company fills direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) orders on its website and via online marketplaces. The Company markets its products through many domestic retail outlets and numerous retailers worldwide. The Company also markets products directly to several OEMs for use in their products. In the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company’s largest sales concentration was represented by its own DTC offerings via the Amazon portal and were approximately 19% and 17% of net sales in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company’s products have broad distribution worldwide across many channels including distributors, specialty stores, mass merchants, and electronics stores. The Company is dependent upon its ability to retain a base of retailers and distributors to sell the Company’s line of products. A material loss or disruption of retailers and/or distributors could result in a loss of product placement and have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial results. The Company’s five largest customers accounted for approximately 50% and 46% of net sales in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. COMPETITION The Company principally focuses on the stereo headphone industry. In the stereo headphone market, the Company competes with all major competitors, many of which are large and diversified and have greater total assets and resources than the Company. The extent to which retailers and consumers view the Company as a pioneer in the creation of the personal listening industry, an innovative vendor of high-quality stereo headphone products, and a provider of excellent after-sales customer service and direct sales, is the extent to which the Company offers a competitive advantage. The Company relies upon its unique sound, quality workmanship, brand identification, engineering skills, and customer service, as well as its intellectual property portfolio, to support its competitive position. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The Company’s research and development activities are conducted by both Company personnel and outside consultants. The Company expects to incur on-going research and development costs related to its Bluetooth® and traditional wired headphones as it is planning to introduce new product offerings on a regular basis. The increasing costs related to worldwide certification of these technologies by country has increased the costs of regional compliance testing and has impacted the time to market on these wireless items. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company believes that it has materially complied with all currently existing federal, state and local statutes and regulations regarding environmental standards and occupational safety and health matters to which it is subject. During fiscal years 2025 and 2024, the amounts incurred in complying with federal, state and local statutes and regulations pertaining to environmental standards and occupational safety and health laws and regulations did not materially affect the Company’s operating results or financial condition. The increased public awareness and concern regarding climate change has resulted in increased regulations which are rapidly evolving. The Company continues to monitor the evolving regulations, as well as related required disclosures, to ensure that we will be conformant. It is unclear as to whether any emerging and evolving regulations will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.

EMPLOYEES As of June 30, 2025, the Company employed 28 employees, 2 of which were part-time employees. The Company did not engage any temporary personnel during the year ended June 30, 2025.
None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. FOREIGN SALES The Company’s competitive position and risks relating to its business in foreign markets are comparable to those in the domestic market. In addition, the governments of the United States and foreign nations may elect to erect trade barriers and impose further tariffs on exports and/or imports, respectively. The creation of additional barriers would reduce the Company’s net sales and net income. In addition, any fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the pricing of the Company’s products and divert customers who might choose to purchase lower-priced, less profitable products, and could affect overall demand for the Company’s products. For further information, see Part II, Item 7, as well as additional description of risks related to our business in foreign markets described in Part I, Item 1A. under “We may be subject to risks related to doing business in, and having counterparties based in, foreign countries.” The Company has sales personnel currently located in the Netherlands and the Caucasus region to service the international export marketplace. The loss of these personnel would result in a transfer of sales and marketing responsibility. The Company sells its products to independent distributors in countries and regions outside the United States including Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, South America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Canada and Mexico. During the last two fiscal years, net sales of all Koss products were distributed as follows:
2025 2024United States $ 8,968,799 $ 9,795,438Sweden
1,247,981

66,682All other countries
590,768
664,062Net sales $ 12,624,170 $ 12,265,069 As a result of the Russian-Ukraine conflict, the Company suspended all sales to Russia in accordance with Executive Order 14071 issued by President Biden on April 6, 2022. Sales to Ukraine have also been impacted as a result of the humanitarian crisis there due to the ongoing hostilities. In the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no sales to Russia, however, sales to Ukraine resumed in fiscal year 2024 and those sales represented approximately 2% and 9% of the Company’s export business during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company is uncertain how the conflict will impact future sales. MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS The Company has a manufacturing facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and uses contract manufacturing facilities in the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan. A contract employee is based in China to manage supplier quality and to assist with development of new products. Since these independent suppliers are not located in the United States, the Company is at risk of business interruptions due to natural disasters, war, disease and government intervention through tariffs or trade restrictions that are of less concern domestically. The Company maintains finished goods inventory in its U.S. facility to mitigate this risk. The Company’s goal is to stock finished goods inventory at an average of approximately 90 days demand per item. Recovery of a single facility through replacement of a supplier in the event of a disaster or suspension of supply could take an estimated six to twelve months, in which case the Company believes that it could restore production of its top 10 selling models (which represented approximately 56% of the Company’s 2025 net sales) within 18-24 months. Required compliance testing impacts the time it takes to bring a product to market as well as the time necessary to retool a product and re-enter the marketplace. The Company is also at risk if trade restrictions are introduced on its products based upon country of origin. In addition, the Company may not be able to pass along most increases in tariffs and freight charges to the Company’s customers, which would directly affect profits. ‎

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS We are subject to various risks that may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, including, but not limited to, those set forth below. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider, however, there may be other risks that are currently deemed immaterial or not currently known to us that could materially impact the business. If any of the following risks, or those unidentified, develop into actual events, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Macroeconomic and Political Risks The Company's operations and results are influenced by both global and regional economic environments, and less than favorable economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, operating results, and financial position. The Company sales outside the U.S. represent nearly 30% of total net sales for the fiscal year ended Jne 30, 2025. Moreover, the Company relies almost exclusively on contract manufacturing facilities based in the People’s Republic of China to produce its goods, underscoring the critical importance of this region to its overall operations. As a result, the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable global, national, and regional economic conditions and political developments. Inflationary pressures, sustained higher interest rates, and increased energy and labor costs have reduced consumer discretionary spending and may continue to impact demand for the Company’s products. In addition, supply chain disruptions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and the imposition of new tariffs or trade restrictions could increase our costs and reduce profitability. The Company’s operations may be affected by political developments, international trade disputes and restrictions, natural disasters, public health concerns, and other disruptions to business activities. Political developments, international trade or other disputes, natural disasters, public health concerns, and various business disruptions may have a significant adverse impact on the Company, as well as its customers, employees, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, and distributors.Uncertainty associated with the current U.S. presidential administration and changes in government policies that have and will continue to occur may operations, cost structure, and competitive environment. For example, the recent changes to corporate tax laws and rates, environmental regulations, international trade agreements and newly enacted tariffs could increase operating costs or reduce access to key markets. Furthermore, political polarization within the United States and the possibility of policy reversals or delayed legislative action may contribute to economic volatility and reduce business and consumer confidence.Primarily all of the Company’s contract manufacturing facilities are located in China and we do not currently have arrangements with contract manufacturers in other countries that may be acceptable substitutes. Significant increases in wages or wage taxes paid by contract manufacturing facilities may increase the cost of goods manufactured in China which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s profit margins and profitability. Additionally, restrictions on international trade, the imposition of tariffs, sanctions and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely impact the Company’s business and supply chain. Further restrictive measures, which could be announced with little or no warning, could limit the Company’s ability to source materials and product from China at acceptable prices or at all and necessitate a change to the Company’s supply chain which would be disruptive, time-consuming and expensive. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs, export controls, countermeasures, or other trade measures between the U.S. and China or other countries and what products may be subject to such actions. To the extent such actions inhibit our transactions with contract manufacturing facilities and suppliers in China, our business may be materially adversely affected. See further discussion below under “The Company is dependent on the proper functioning of our contract manufacturers, our supply chain, and our distribution networks. Any disruptions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations” and “A shift in U.S. and China trade relations, policies and imposed tariffs could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.” Geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts and acts of terrorism could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Ongoing and escalating geopolitical conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine war, instability in the Middle East, and heightened tensions between the United States and China, create significant uncertainty in the global economic and regulatory environment. These conflicts may lead to supply chain disruptions, restrictions on the movement of goods, changes in trade policies, and imposition of new tariffs, sanctions, or export controls. For example, the conflict in Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions and trade restrictions on Russia have caused and are expected to continue to cause, global political, economic and social instability, volatility in
9 Table of Contents
commodity prices and energy prices, increased cyberattacks and disruptions to the global economy. In accordance with Executive Order 14071 signed on April 6, 2022 soon after the war began, the Company suspended sales to Russia. Also, as a result of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine created by the war and the population seeking refuge in other countries, sales to Ukraine have been impacted. There were no sales to Russia during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, however, sales to Ukraine resumed in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 with more expected in the future. Prior to the imposition of the sanctions against Russia, fiscal year 2022 sales to Russia approximated 2% of the Company’s total sales.
Recent years have seen escalating conflicts in the Middle East, involving attacks by militant groups, responses from national defense forces, and retaliatory actions across borders. Such military engagements often bring international involvement, with foreign powers providing support, participating in defense operations, and sometimes engaging in evacuations. These developments underscore the increasing complexity and risk within the global geopolitical landscape. The conflicts have exacerbated regional instability, impacted global shipping lanes and increased energy and raw material costs.
Tensions between the U.S. and China could result in additional tariffs beyond what were recently imposed, retaliatory trade measures, or regulatory restrictions that increase the cost of manufacturing and sourcing materials. These risks may limit the Company’s ability to procure critical products and components, extend lead times, increase transportation and input costs, and adversely impact competitiveness in key markets. In addition, the uncertain and rapidly evolving nature of these geopolitical developments makes it difficult to predict the full extent of their impact on the Company’s operations, financial condition, and results of operations. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation.
Persistent inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates have the potential to adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. The Company continues to experience inflationary cost pressures in commodities, packaging materials, wages and higher energy and transportation costs, thus potentially impacting the ability to meet customer demand. The Company attempts to mitigate these increases through pricing strategies, as well as working with a dedicated freight forwarding partner to minimize freight rate increases. Inflation may impact customer demand for the Company’s products resulting from a slowdown in consumer spending as disposable income decreases due to rising interest rates, the price of essential items, availability of credit and dwindling savings. Other risk factors further exacerbated by inflation include supply chain disruptions, increased oil and energy costs, risks of international operations and the recruitment and retention of talent.
Risks Related to our International Operations We may be subject to risks related to doing business in, and having counterparties based in, foreign countries.   We engage in operations, and enter into agreements with counterparties located outside the U.S., which exposes us to political, governmental, and economic instability and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Any disruption caused by these factors could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and prospects. Risks associated with potential operations, commitments, and investments outside of the U.S. include but are not limited to risks of: global and local economic, social and political conditions and uncertainty;currency exchange restrictions and currency fluctuations;export and import duties;additional tariffs imposed on exports from the U.S. to other countries, potentially impacting pricing to customers in those countries;war, such as the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, military conflicts in the Middle East or terrorist attack;local outbreak of disease or pandemic;renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts or international trade arrangements;labor market conditions and workers’ rights affecting our manufacturing operations or those of our customers;macro-economic conditions impacting key markets and sources of supply;changing laws and policies affecting trade, taxation, financial regulation, immigration, and investment;compliance with laws and regulations that differ among jurisdictions, including those covering taxes, intellectual property ownership and infringement, imports and exports, anti-corruption, and anti-bribery, antitrust and competition, data privacy, and environment, health, and safety; andgeneral hazards associated with the assertion of sovereignty over areas in which operations are conducted, transactions occur, or counterparties are located.

A shift in U.S. and China trade relations, policies and imposed tariffs could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company’s operations and financial results are subject to risks arising from evolving U.S.-China trade relations. In April 2025, the U.S. government imposed tariffs of up to 145% on certain imports from China, significantly increasing the Company’s costs of goods sourced from China. On May 12, 2025, the U.S. and China reached a temporary 90-day trade truce, reducing these tariffs to approximately 30%, including a 10% baseline reciprocal tariff and a 20% surcharge on specific categories. The truce, effective May 14 through August 12, 2025, resulted in a suspension of the elevated China-specific tariff rates, with China reciprocally reducing tariffs on U.S. exports. On August 12, 2025, the US and China extended a tariff truce for another 90 days, pushing negotiations into the fall. The long-term trajectory of trade policy remains uncertain. Failure to extend the agreement could result in the reinstatement of triple-digit percentage tariffs on imports from China, materially increasing the Company’s cost of goods sold and potentially disrupting supply chains. In addition, legal challenges to the tariffs are ongoing in U.S. courts, creating further uncertainty about the scope and enforceability of these measures. Continued volatility in trade relations between the U.S. and China, including the potential for reinstated tariffs or new trade restrictions, could adversely impact the Company’s sourcing, pricing, and profitability. The Company is actively monitoring these developments and assessing mitigation strategies, including alternative sourcing arrangements, however, no assurance can be given that such strategies will fully offset the impact of adverse trade policy changes. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the Company’s financial results and operations, including with respect to pricing of products and overall demand for the Company’s products.
The Company receives a material portion of its sales and profits from business in Europe. To the extent that the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to currencies in those jurisdictions, it increases the cost of the Company’s products in those jurisdictions, which could create negative pressure on the foreign demand for the Company’s products. The Company is paid by its international customers in U.S. dollars. Volatility in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could result in increased prices, a decrease in the overall demand for the Company’s products or lead customers to purchase lower-priced, lower profit products and, as such, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Operational and Financial Risks The Company is dependent on the proper functioning of our contract manufacturers, our supply chain, and our distribution networks. Any disruptions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company relies on our third-party supply chain and distribution networks and the availability of necessary components to produce a considerable number of our products. A reduction or interruption in supply, including interruptions due to possible future pandemic- related restrictions, geopolitical unrest, labor shortages or strikes, or a failure to procure adequate components, may lead to delays in manufacturing or increases in costs. Over 90% of the Company’s products are sourced from contract manufacturing facilities in the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan. There has been increasing geopolitical tension between China and Taiwan that may affect future shipments from Taiwan-based suppliers. Any other adverse changes in the social, political, regulatory or economic conditions in the countries could materially increase the cost of the products we buy from our foreign suppliers or delay shipments of products. There has also been increasing geopolitical tension between China and the United States. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, economic relations and further escalation of trade tensions between the United States and China, or any other country in which the Company conducts business, could result in retaliatory trade restrictions that restrict our ability to source products from China or continue business in such other country. Any alterations to our business strategy or operations made in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes would be time-consuming and expensive, and the Company may not be able to pass along most increases in tariffs and freight charges to the Company’s customers, which would also directly affect profits. Our dependence on foreign suppliers for our products also necessitates ordering products further in advance than we would if manufactured domestically, thus increasing investments in inventory. Delays in receiving and shipping products due to interruptions in its supply chain would pose a risk of lower sales to the Company and the potential for price volatility, negatively impacting profits. Recovery of a single facility through replacement of a supplier in the event of a disaster or suspension of supply could take an estimated six to twelve months. We have experienced, and may again in the future experience supplier price increases, supply chain and shipping interruptions and constraints, volatility in demand for our products caused by sudden and significant changes in production levels by our suppliers, and disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply

elements such as raw materials or other product components, transportation, work force, or force majeure events.
Our inability to mitigate any of these disruptions may lead to a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The current hostilities in Eastern Europe and the resulting economic sanctions imposed by the government have impacted the global economy. While we have no operations in Russia or Ukraine, we are unable to sell to certain of our customers in Russia as a result of this event. The continuation of the military conflict in Eastern Europe, as well as the tension in the Middle East, could lead to increased supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and volatility in global markets that could negatively impact our operations. The economies of Europe have also been impacted by these conflicts as a direct result of disruptions in transportation and the supply of energy, high food prices and tight credit. These factors can have a direct impact on the consumer’s ability to access and purchase the Company’s products. The Company continuously monitors its supply chain in order to modify business plans as may be necessary. This could include increasing the investment in inventory, being alert to potential short supply situations, assisting suppliers with acquisition of critical components and utilizing alternative sources and/or air freight. However, these measures may entail additional costs to the Company and cannot guarantee that the Company will not be adversely affected by supply chain disruptions. Any disruption to any link in the Company’s supply or distribution chain can have a negative impact on results. Failure to attract and retain customers to sell the Company’s products could adversely affect sales volume and future profitability. The Company markets a line of products used by consumers to listen to music. The Company distributes these products through large domestic distributors and some retail channels in the U.S. and independent distributors throughout the rest of the world. The Company is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain a base of customers to sell the Company’s line of products. The Company has broad distribution across many channels including specialty stores, mass merchants, electronics stores and computer retailers. The Company may not be able to maintain customers or model selections and therefore may experience a reduction in its sales revenue until a model is restored to the mix or a lost customer is replaced by a new customer. The loss of business of one or more principal customers or a change in the sales volume from a particular customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s sales volume and profitability. A shift in customer specifications to lower priced items can reduce profit margins, negatively impacting profitability. The Company sells lines of products with suggested retail prices ranging from less than $10 up to $1,000. The gross margin for each of these models varies in terms of percentages. The Company finds the low-priced portion of the market most competitive and therefore most subject to pressure on gross margin percentages, which tends to lower profit contributions. Therefore, a shift in customer specifications and preferences toward lower priced items could lead to lower gross margins and lower profit contributions per unit of sale. Due to the range of products that the Company sells, the product sales mix can produce a variation in profit margins. Some distributors sell a limited range of products that yield lower profit margins than others. Most notably, the budget-priced stereo headphone segment of the market (below $10 retail), which is distributed through mass market retailers, computer stores, and office supply stores and to school systems, tends to yield the lowest gross margins. An increase in business with these types of accounts, if coupled with a simultaneous reduction in sales to customers with higher gross margins, would reduce profit margins and profitability. If we are unable to continue to develop innovative and popular products, our brand image may be harmed and demand for our products may decrease. Consumer electronics are subject to constantly and rapidly changing consumer preferences based on industry trends and performance features, including technological advancement. Our success depends largely on our ability to lead, anticipate, gauge and respond to these changing consumer preferences and trends in a timely manner, while preserving and strengthening the perception and authenticity of our brand. We must continue to develop high performance products that provide better design and performance attributes than the products of our competitors at similar price points. Market acceptance of new designs and products is subject to uncertainty, and we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful. Market acceptance for new products may also require substantial marketing efforts and expenditures to increase consumer demand, which could constrain our management, financial and operational resources. If new designs and products we introduce do not gain broad market acceptance or demand for our existing products wanes, our sales, brand image, business and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We may not be able to compete effectively, which could cause our net sales and market share to decline. The consumer electronics industry is highly competitive, and characterized by frequent introduction of new competitors, as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their product portfolio, aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins and rapid consolidation of the market resulting in larger competitors. We face competition from consumer electronics brands that have historically dominated the stereo headphone market, in addition to sport brands, lifestyle companies and consumer electronics giants that also source or produce headphone products. These competitors may have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, engineering, distribution and marketing resources, longer operating histories, better brand

recognition among certain groups of consumers, and greater economies of scale. In addition, these competitors often have long-term relationships with many larger retailers that are potentially more important to those retailers. As a result, these competitors may be better equipped to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in consumer preferences;readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities;discounting excess inventory;devoting greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement and product endorsement;adopting aggressive pricing policies; andengaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other legal disputes. Additionally, the industry in which we compete generally has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace. If we are unable to protect our brand image and authenticity, while carefully balancing our growth, we may be unable to effectively compete with these new market entrants or new products. The inability to compete effectively against new and existing competitors could have an adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations, preventing us from achieving future growth. If we are unable to obtain intellectual property rights and/or enforce those rights against third parties who are violating those rights, our business could suffer. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets and trade dress to protect our brand name, reputation, product appearance and technology. If we fail to obtain, maintain, or in some cases enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to copy our designs, or use our brand name, trademarks, or technology. As a result, if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, or resolve any conflicts effectively, our results of operations may be harmed. Regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. If resolved against us, such legal proceedings could result in excessive verdicts, injunctive relief or other equitable relief that may affect how we operate our business. Similarly, if we settle such legal proceedings, it may negatively affect how we operate our business. In connection with its ongoing intellectual property enforcement program, which includes lawsuits alleging infringement of patents relating to its wireless audio technology, the Company has granted licenses covering certain Company patents. Other similar complaints filed remain outstanding. As all litigation is uncertain, there can be no assurance that any of this remaining or future litigation will be decided in our favor.
We may be adversely affected by the financial condition of our retailers and distributors. We depend on, and expect to continue to depend on, sales to several significant distributors and retailers. Some of them may experience financial difficulties because of current or future adverse economic conditions. A retailer or distributor experiencing such difficulties generally will not purchase and sell as many of our products as it would under normal circumstances and may cancel orders. In addition, a retailer or distributor experiencing financial difficulties generally increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables. We extend credit to our retailers and distributors based on our assessment of their financial condition, generally without requiring collateral, and sometimes are not able to obtain information regarding their current financial status. Failure of these retailers or distributors to remain current on their obligations to us could result in losses that exceed the reserves we set aside in anticipation of this risk. We are also exposed to the risk of our customers declaring bankruptcy, exposing us to claims of preferential payment claims. Any loss, cancellation or reduction of purchases by these distributors or retailers may have a material adverse effect on our business. Direct-to-Consumer sales through the Amazon marketplace account for a significant amount of our net sales and the loss of, or reduced purchases from, this sales channel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our largest concentration of sales in fiscal year 2025 came from our DTC sales via the Amazon portal and accounted for more than 19% and 17% of our net sales in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. We do not have long-term contracts to conduct sales through the Amazon portal or for sales to any of our customers, and all of our customers generally purchase from us on a purchase order basis. As a result, Amazon or any other customer generally may, with no notice or penalty, cease ordering and selling our products, or materially reduce their orders. If certain customers, individually or in aggregate, choose to no longer sell our products, slow their rate of purchase of our products or decrease the number of unique products they purchase, our results of operations would be adversely affected.

Our products may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to our reputation. We offer products that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Defects can also exist in components used for our products. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of property damage and personal injury. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect all issues and defects in the products it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant, and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products, delay in new product introductions and lost sales. An information systems interruption, cyberattack or breach in security could adversely affect our business. We rely on accounting, financial, and operational management information systems to conduct our operations. Any disruption in these systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Furthermore, as part of our normal business activities, we collect and store common confidential information about customers, employees, vendors, and suppliers. This information is entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes. Any failure to maintain the security of the data, including the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in customers confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Cyberattacks are a growing geopolitical risk, becoming larger, more frequent, more sophisticated and more relentless as technology has evolved, resulting in privacy, security, and compliance concerns. They are a significant threat to individual organizations and national security. High-profile security breaches at other companies and in government agencies have increased in recent years, and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting businesses. While we devote resources to security measures to protect our systems and data, these measures cannot provide absolute security. These types of attacks can also have an impact on the entire supply and distribution chain for the Company’s product line. Given connectivity through the internet, the Company can only be as strong as the weakest link, whether that is a financial service provider, third party distributor, reseller, transportation service provider, contract manufacturer, customer or consumer. Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States. The Company’s effective income tax rate and profitability could be adversely affected in the future by several factors, including changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative guidance or interpretations at the federal, state, or international level and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. ‎On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBB Act”), a sweeping tax and spending law that makes permanent many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), while introducing new tax policies and restructuring others. While certain provisions may reduce the Company’s tax liability, such as modifications to corporate tax rates, deductions, credits, treatment of foreign income, and expensing rules, others may introduce new complexity and audit risk. The Company will continue to monitor the potential impact of the OBBB Act. Because tax laws are dynamic and often retroactive or uncertain in interpretation, projected tax liabilities may differ significantly from eventual obligations. The net impact remains uncertain, and misapplication of the new rules could lead to materially adverse outcomes. The Company regularly assesses all of these tax-related matters to determine the adequacy of its tax provision. If current tax strategies are ineffective or not in compliance with domestic and international tax laws, the Company’s financial position, operating results, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Risks Related to our Stock  Our stock price has been, and may in the future, be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility. The market price of our stock is subject to price volatility. Additionally, over the years, the Company, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have experienced dramatic and extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been driven primarily by social media hype rather than companies’ operating performance and prospects. Factors such as the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock, investor perceptions of us and our business, actions by institutional shareholders, strategic actions by us, litigation, changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations and principles, additions or departures of key personnel, a decline in demand for our products and our results of operations, financial performance and future prospects may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may

limit or prevent investors from realizing the liquidity of their shares. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the sales price of our common stock fluctuated between a reported high sales price of $18.73 on July 3, 2024 and a reported low sales price of $4.00 on April 9, 2025. The trading volume in shares of our common stock can also vary widely. For example, during the most recent fiscal year, daily trading volume ranged from a low of 11,400 shares on May 1, 2025 to a high of 70,055,500 on July 3, 2024. Our market capitalization, as implied by various trading prices, can reflect valuations that diverge significantly from those seen prior to volatility and, to the extent these valuations reflect trading dynamics unrelated to our financial performance or prospects, purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses if there are declines in market prices driven by a return to earlier valuations. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock.
A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our common stock that largely exceeds supply could lead to extreme price volatility in shares of our common stock.
In the past, securities of certain companies have experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due to a sudden increase in demand for stock resulting in aggregate short positions in the stock exceeding the number of shares available for purchase, forcing investors with short exposure to pay a premium to repurchase shares for delivery to share lenders. This is known as a “short squeeze.” These short squeezes can lead to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Trading by short sellers may increase the likelihood that our common stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in shares of our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our common stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our common stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of our common stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.
The Koss family, including certain members of our management, owns a significant percentage of our stock and, as a result, the trading price for our shares may be depressed and it can take actions that may be adverse to the interests of our stockholders. Michael Koss, our President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 3,858,410 shares of our common stock as of August 1, 2025, representing 40.8% of shares outstanding on such date, including shares held by a voting trust over which Mr. Koss holds sole voting and dispositive power. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with a large stockholder, since such a stockholder can significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, due to his significant ownership stake and his service as our Principal Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Michael Koss directs the management of our business and affairs. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination that could be favorable to our other stockholders. Future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public markets by our insiders, or the perception that these sales may occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
Our employees, directors and officers, and their affiliates collectively hold substantial amounts of shares of our common stock and have vested options for the purchase of our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of such shares by these stockholders, or the perception that such sales will occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Other than restrictions on trading that arise under securities laws (or pursuant to our Insider Trading and Tipping Policy that is intended to facilitate compliance with securities laws), including the prohibition on trading in securities by or on behalf of a person who is aware of nonpublic material information, we have no restrictions on the right of our employees, directors and officers, and their affiliates, to sell their unrestricted shares of common stock. ‎

ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 1C.   CYBERSECURITY Risk Management and Strategy The Company maintains policies and processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risk from cybersecurity threats, and has integrated these processes into the overall risk management processes. The Company has programs in place intended to address and mitigate the cybersecurity risks that could adversely impact customers and/or reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions, loss of business, production downtimes and operational delays. These programs include regular monitoring of outside threats, continuous updating of software to mitigate risk, implementation of a formal policy related to employees that access corporate systems from personal devices, a simplification of infrastructure to minimize servers and migration of business-critical systems, including the Company’s ERP system, to Tier-1 cloud service providers.
Enhancements have also been made to endpoint protection and remote access protocols, including enhanced encryption, two-factor authentication (2FA) and real-time threat monitoring. Annual vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, as well as periodic web application and internal network scanning, are performed by third party service providers as directed by the Company’s Managed Service Provider (“MSP”). The results of these tests are shared with the CFO by the MSP. We have processes in place to evaluate the potential risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party service providers that have access to our data, including a review process for such providers’ cybersecurity practices, risk assessments, contractual requirement and system monitoring. The Company also partners with a breach protection platform to provide ongoing, self-guided cybersecurity training to its employees to reduce risk from phishing, social engineering and password-related attacks.
The Company has not been impacted by any previous cybersecurity incidents that would materially affect business operations, customer relationships or financial conditions.  Governance Cybersecurity remains a critical component of corporate governance at the Company. The Company’s MSP is responsible for identifying and assessing risks on an ongoing basis to ensure that the Company’s policies and procedures are functioning as designed to protect the Company’s information systems from potential cybersecurity threats. Management is provided regular updates on the Company’s cybersecurity programs, training metrics, system health status and material cybersecurity risk and mitigation strategies, along with any necessary enhancements to those programs. Cybersecurity policies and processes are reviewed annually with the Board of Directors, which serves in an oversight role as a whole. In addition, the Audit Committee and the Board consider risk-related matters on an ongoing basis in connection with deliberations regarding specific transactions and issues and would be notified immediately of any cybersecurity incidents. ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES The Company leases its 126,000 square foot facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from Koss Holdings, LLC, which is controlled by five equal ownership interests in trusts held by the five beneficiaries of the former chairman’s revocable trust and includes current stockholders of the Company. On May 24, 2022, the lease was renewed extending the expiration to June 30, 2028 (the “Extended Term”), with a second extension (“Second Extended Term”) to June 30, 2033. The lease extension maintains the rent at a fixed rate of $380,000 per year for the Extended Term with an increase to $397,000 per year for the Second Extended Term. The negotiated increase in rent slated for 2028 will be the first increase in rent under the lease since 1996. The lease is being accounted for as an operating lease. The Company is responsible for all property maintenance, insurance, taxes, and other normal expenses related to ownership. The Company utilizes its Milwaukee facility for administrative, corporate and production functions. All facilities are in good repair and, in the opinion of the management, are suitable and adequate for the Company’s business purposes.  ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS As part of its intellectual property enforcement program, on July 22, 2020, the Company brought patent infringement suits against certain parties, including PEAG, LLC d/b/a jLab Audio and Skullcandy, Inc., alleging infringement of the Company’s patents relating to its wireless headphone technology and seeking monetary relief and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits still unresolved are pending in Southern District of California (PEAG, LLC), and District of Utah (Skullcandy, Inc.). In early fiscal 2020, the Company was notified by One-E-Way, Inc. that some of the Company’s wireless products may infringe on certain One-E-Way patents. A Supplemental Notice of Infringement was sent to the Company on March 18, 2025. The Company is investigating the merits of the notice.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the financial position, results of operations, cash flows, indebtedness, and other key financial information of the Company for fiscal years 2025 and 2024. Unless otherwise indicated, comparisons of financial information reflect the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 versus the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See also the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 4 of this Report.  Overview John C. Koss and the Company have been recognized as the creator of the personal listening industry. The Company initially developed the first Koss SP 3 stereo headphones in 1958 and has been an innovator in the field ever since. We market a complete line of high-fidelity headphones, wireless Bluetooth® headphones, wireless Bluetooth® speakers, computer headsets, telecommunications headsets, and active noise canceling headphones. Koss operates as one business segment, as its only business line is the design, manufacture and sale of stereo headphones and related personal listening accessories. The Company’s products are sold domestically and internationally through a variety of retailers and distributors, as well as directly to other manufacturers to include with their own products. Changes in sales volume are driven primarily by the addition or loss of customers, a customer adding or removing a product from its inventory, or changes in economic conditions. Sales levels are less impacted by seasonality or the traditional holiday shopping season. Although certain of the Company’s products could be viewed as essential by consumers for use with mobile phones and other portable electronic devices, many other models represent a more discretionary spend. The results of the Company’s operations are therefore susceptible to consumer confidence and adverse macroeconomic factors such as newly imposed tariffs, inflation, slower growth or recession, higher interest rates, and wage and commodity inflation. In addition, the economic sanctions imposed as a result of the Russia/Ukraine conflict have impacted certain of our customers in those markets and the surrounding regions.  Fiscal Year 2025 Summary Net sales grew 2.9% to $12,624,170, mainly as a result of a 48% increase in sales to our European distributors, a 16.5% increase in Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) sales. The growth was somewhat offset by lower sales to domestic distributors claiming excess inventory of prior year models of non-Koss electronics combined with a drop in sales to the Education market due to a delay in an order while awaiting budget approval. Overall domestic sales fell 8.4% while Export sales grew quite significantly at 48%.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased by 3.7 percentage points over the prior fiscal year from 34.1% to 37.8%. A favorable sales mix, with a higher mix of higher margin sales to certain domestic distributors and DTC coupled with sales to Europe that generated higher than normal margins due to new product sales. The prior year’s adverse impact of the continued sell-through of inventory brought in at higher freight rates also contributed to the favorable gross margin for the 2025 fiscal year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7.5% over the prior fiscal year principally due to the increase in new product compliance testing and certification. Legal fees and expenses also increased in support of the Company’s patent defense litigation and the settlement of an ADA lawsuit related to the Koss.com website.
Total tax expense of $17,482 was recorded for the year ended June 30, 2025 driven by minimum required payments and in increase in the uncertain tax position (UTP) related to research and development credits taken in the prior year and the appropriate tax and penalties that would be incurred should there be a denial of the credits
During the prior year, a federal tax benefit of $73,604 was recorded as a result of the return-to-provision adjustment identified during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.

7.2%  2025 Results of Operations Compared with 2024   Net sales for the year ending June 30, 2025 were $12,624,170, a 2.9% increase compared to $12,265,069 in the prior fiscal year, primarily behind a 48% increase in sales to Europe and a 16.5% increase in DTC sales.  Growth in net export sales of $1,185,738, or 48%, for the fiscal year 2025 is predominantly driven by the significant increase in sales to two of the Company’s largest European distributors, which consisted of nearly $1,400,000 new product sales. Sales to the Asian markets were up almost 52%, assisting Europe with the overall increase.
For the year ended June 30, 2025, domestic sales declined by 8.4%, or $826,637. Sales to our domestic distributors were down 27.3% behind weak commitments to stocking inventory and there was a $531,000 drop in sales to the Education market due to a delay in the finalization of a significant order while awaiting budget approval. E-tailer and Music and Books sales also declined $441,035 compared to the prior year. DTC and certain domestic distributors saw a combined sales increase of $860,019 for the year ended June 30, 2025, partially offsetting the overall decline. DTC sales represent 24% of the Company’s total sales and the noteworthy increase appears to be driven by new product launches, continued page optimizations and increased online advertising efforts.  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2025 was 37.8% versus 34.1% for the prior fiscal year. Gross margins vary by customer, product, and markets and, as a result, any shifts in the mix can impact the overall gross margin. A favorable mix of higher margin sales to certain of our domestic distributors and DTC sales was coupled with a higher mix of sales to Europe which included a significant amount of sales of new product at higher margins. This was slightly offset by the adverse impact of newly imposed tariffs included in inventory sold in the last quarter of fiscal year 2025 along with a write-off of some obsolete inventory. The negative impact of the sell-through of inventory brought in at higher freight rates in the prior year also contributed to the increase in gross margins year over year. Freight rates increased slightly throughout the year due mainly to strong demand, capacity constraints and disruptions in major ports. Rates are expected to settle back down in the first part of the coming fiscal year as the Peak Season Surcharge (PSS) imposed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 was cancelled. The Company renewed its partnership agreement with a dedicated freight forwarder, which will continue to provide access to lower freight rates even if market rates should go up, and a lane was added to a bonded warehouse which may be utilized to defer tariff spend. The cost of additional loading, unloading and storage at this new facility will be offset by the delayed payments to the Custom Border Patrol for product stored there until final delivery to the Company. The first shipment to the bonded warehouse occurred in August 2025, deferring the tariffs until the product arrives at the Company’s plant in Milwaukee, WI. The Company continues to stay abreast of current events that might impact future freight rates and will act accordingly to ensure availability of goods. The impact of broader economic factors such as newly imposed tariffs, inflation and shifts in consumer behavior could result in overcapacity in the market and rising freight costs. The Company continues to monitor the situation. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose by approximately $453,000, or 7.5%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. New product compliance testing and certifications were the main driver of the increase, combined with higher online marketing spend. Legal costs incurred for a Supreme Court appeal in the Company’s continued patent litigation, along with legal fees incurred and a settlement paid related to an ADA lawsuit brought against the Koss.com website, also contributed to the year over year increase. A reduction in stock-based compensation expense partially offset the increases as any remaining unvested stock options granted with the Koss Corporation 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”) are nearly fully vested.

Interest income of $879,774 and $847,644 was recorded during the fiscal years ended June 30 2025 and 2024, respectively, due almost entirely to interest earned on the U.S. Treasury investments held during the years in order to earn a return on the Company’s excess cash while maintaining a low risk profile.
Total tax expense of $17,482 was recorded for the year ended June 30, 2025. Federal tax expense of $5,570 was recorded for the uncertain tax position related to research and development (R&D) credits taken in a prior year and state tax expense of $11,912 related mostly to minimum estimated state tax payments due. In the prior year, a net income tax benefit of $73,604 was reported for the year, which included a federal income tax benefit of $81,278 recorded as a result of the return-to-provision (RTP) adjustments recorded in the period identified. The RTP adjustments were identified as part of the preparation and submission of the fiscal year 2023 tax returns during the third quarter fiscal year 2024. State income tax expense of $7,674, which represented only the required minimum estimated tax payments due, partially offset the benefit. The effective tax rate was 2.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to 7.2% for the previous fiscal year. The Company’s taxable losses for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 increased the federal tax loss carryforward by approximately $1,150,000 and $1,270,000, respectively, resulting in an expected carryforward of approximately $34,00,000 by the end of the current fiscal year. The current fiscal year adjustment to the net operating loss carryforward increased the deferred tax asset to approximately $8,700,000 as of June 30, 2025, and the future realization of this continues to be uncertain. The valuation allowance was increased to fully offset the net deferred tax asset as there is sufficient negative evidence to support the maintaining of a full valuation allowance as, excluding unusual, infrequent items, a three-year cumulative tax loss occurred.
As previously reported, the Company maintains a program focused on enforcing its intellectual property and, in particular, certain of its patent portfolio. The Company has enforced its intellectual property by filing complaints against certain parties alleging infringement on the Company’s patents relating to its wireless headphone technology. The Company has, in the past, recovered certain of the fees and costs that were involved with the underlying efforts to enforce this portfolio and, if the program continues to be successful with the remaining complaints, the Company may receive additional royalties, offers to purchase its intellectual property, or other remedies advantageous to its competitive position. There is no guarantee, however, of a positive outcome from these efforts, which could ultimately be time-consuming and unsuccessful. Additionally, the Company may owe all or a portion of any future proceeds arising from the enforcement program to third parties. The Company believes that its financial position remains strong. The Company had $2.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $12.9 million of short-term investments and available credit facilities of $5.0 million on June 30, 2025.
U.S. tariff policy has undergone significant changes under President Donald Trump’s administration, leading to heightened global trade tensions and economic repercussions. In April 2025, the U.S. government imposed tariffs of up to 145% on certain imports from China, significantly increasing the Company’s expected duty costs for goods sourced from China. On May 12, 2025, the U.S. and China reached a temporary 90-day trade truce, reducing these tariffs to approximately 30%. During fiscal year 2025, inflation remained elevated with Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation up 2.6% compared to a year ago. The Federal Reserve has maintained higher interest rates, even amid persisting tariff-driven price pressures. Energy prices have seen some mild relief, although their deflationary impact is modest compared to tariff-induced inflation. As such, rising costs and tariff uncertainty continue to impact consumer confidence with cuts to discretionary spending, switching to lower-priced brands and delaying large purchases which, in turn, impact the Company’s sales volumes. Inflationary cost increases have resulted in higher costs of commodities, packaging materials, and wages, along with higher energy and transportation costs. These increases have been partially mitigated by somewhat higher pricing on new product launches, and the Company continues to work with a dedicated freight forwarding partner to minimize freight rate increases. Other risk factors further exacerbated by inflation include supply chain disruptions, risks of international operations, tight labor markets, and the challenges in recruitment and retention of talent. The Company relies on our third-party supply chain, primarily in southern China, and distribution networks and the availability of necessary components to produce a considerable number of our products. A reduction or interruption in supply, including interruptions due to pandemic related restrictions, geopolitical unrest, labor shortages or strikes, newly imposed tariffs, or a failure to procure adequate components, may lead to delays in manufacturing or increases in costs. The global supply chain remains fragile despite pockets of stabilization and improved predictability. Freight rates have risen due to strong U.S. import demand and rerouting around the Red Sea and Suez Canal. While the Company rarely uses the Suez route and does not expect material impact, elevated costs and transit delays are affecting resellers who rely on carriers traversing that corridor. Freight rates may ease during the new fiscal year, but espionage, tariff uncertainly and capacity stress continue to pose risks. The Company continues to closely monitor developments in the tension in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and the supply chain team remains ready to increase inventory investment as needed. This includes being alert to potential short supply situations, assisting suppliers with acquisition of critical components and utilizing alternative sources and/or air freight.
Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, global financial and credit markets around the world saw heightened volatility. In response to the invasion, the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union, along with others, imposed sweeping
21 Table of Contents
sanctions and export controls targeting Russia’s financial sector, energy, technology, sovereign debt and key individuals. In January 2025, additional sanctions were authorized by the U.S. on Russia’s energy sector, imposing a petroleum services ban and secondary sanctions on operators, insurers, oil producers and certain vessels. The proposed “Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025” aims to impose secondary tariffs and sanctions on countries that continue to fund Russia’s war in Ukraine and Trump has threatened additional action against Russia if they don’t agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. In accordance with Executive Order 14071 signed on April 6, 2022, the Company suspended sales to Russia and during the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no sales to customers in Russia.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past two fiscal years:
Total cash provided by (used in): 2025 2024Operating activities $(214,908) $(190,531)Investing activities
(120,284)
(198,425)Financing activities
305,908
134,975Net (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $(29,284) $(253,981) Operating Activities During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, cash used in operating activities of the Company consisted of approximately $375,000 of payments to the Custom Border Patrol for the newly imposed tariffs on product shipped from China. This was partially offset by IRS refunds of $262,000 relating to employer payroll taxes incorrectly paid in prior years on the gains from the disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options. Cash used in operating activities of the Company during the prior fiscal year related mostly to bonus payouts of $403,000 and funding of $362,000 relating to reimbursement of employee payroll taxes incorrectly withheld on the gains from the disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options. Cash outflow was partially offset by tighter inventory buying practices and interest received on investments.
Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities for fiscal year 2025 was mostly related to capital expenditures comprised of a new roof section replacement for $346,000 and other leasehold improvements of approximately $75,000. The Company also paid life insurance premiums of $71,000 on company-owned life insurance policies for two of its executives. Proceeds of $14,303,000 from the maturity of U.S. Treasury securities were received during the year, of which $14,059,000 was reinvested in new similar securities at a discount of $197,000. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, cash used by investing activities was related to capital expenditures, including the replacement of a roof section of the building and HVAC upgrades for approximately $330,000 and premiums of $82,000 on company-owned life insurance policies for two of its executives. Proceeds of $14,331,000 were received during the prior fiscal year from the maturity of U.S. Treasury securities which were mostly reinvested to purchase $14,286,000 of similar securities at a $300,000 discount.  Financing Activities The cash generated from financing activities in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 was solely a result of stock option exercises. In the fiscal year ended 2025, exercises of stock options for 156,643 shares generated $305,908 of cash while stock option exercises for 65,000 shares in the previous fiscal year generated $134,975 of cash.
As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on its bank line of credit facility under the Credit Agreement (described below under “Credit Facility").  Short Term Liquidity The Company anticipates funding its normal recurring trade payables, accrued expenses, ongoing R&D costs, inventory purchases, related tariffs and any potential interest payments, if it utilizes its line of credit facility, through existing working capital, funds provided by operating activities and interest earned on investments. Payment terms for the majority of the Company’s international customers, as well as custom and OEM customers, are cash in advance whereby funds are received before a shipment is even made. The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, investments in short-term U.S. Treasury securities, cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its credit facility, if any, will be sufficient to meet its anticipated working capital, and capital expenditure requirements during the next twelve months. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company’s business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, then it may
22 Table of Contents
be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditure, or draw on its credit facilities. Management is focused on increasing sales, especially in the U.S. distributor market, DTC, and the export markets, increasing new product introductions, increasing the generation of cash from operations, and improving the Company’s overall earnings to help improve the Company’s liquidity. The Company regularly evaluates new product offerings, inventory levels, and capital expenditure to ensure that it is effectively allocating resources in line with current market conditions. Long Term Liquidity The Company’s future capital requirements, to a certain extent, are also subject to general conditions in or affecting the electronics industry and are subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors that are beyond its control. Moreover, to the extent that existing cash, cash equivalents, cash from operations, and cash from its credit facilities are insufficient to fund its future activities, the Company may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing, subject to the limitations specified in the Credit Agreement (as defined below). In addition, the Company may also need to seek additional equity funding or debt financing if it becomes a party to any agreement or letter of intent for potential investments in, or acquisitions of, businesses, services, or technologies. Credit Facility On May 14, 2019, the Company entered into a secured credit facility (“Credit Agreement”) with Town Bank (“Lender”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $5,000,000 revolving secured credit facility as well as letters of credit for the benefit of the Company of up to a sublimit of $1,000,000. There are no unused line fees in the credit facility. On January 28, 2021, the Credit Agreement was amended to change the interest rate to Wall Street Journal Prime less 1.50%. An amendment effective October 31, 2024 extended the maturity date to October 31, 2026. The Company and the Lender also entered into a General Business Security Agreement dated May 14, 2019 under which the Company granted the Lender a security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets in connection with the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on other indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, certain investments, disposition of assets, mergers and liquidations, among other restrictions. The Company is currently in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings on the facility.  Stock Repurchase Program In April 1995, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase, from time to time, up to $2,000,000 of its common stock for its own account. Subsequently, the Board of Directors periodically approved increases in the amount authorized for repurchase under the program. As of June 30, 2025, the Board had authorized the repurchase of an aggregate of $45,500,000 of common stock under the stock repurchase program, of which $43,360,247 had been expended. No stock repurchases were made under the program during the years ended June 30, 2025 or 2024.  As of June 30, 2025, the amount of common stock subject to repurchase by the Company under the Board of Director’s prior authorization remained $2,139,753 at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Future stock purchases under this program are dependent on management’s assessment of value versus market price, may occur either on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and may be financed through the Company’s cash flow or by borrowing. Contractual Obligation The Company leases the 126,000 square foot facility from Koss Holdings, LLC, which is controlled by five equal ownership interests in trusts held by the five beneficiaries of the former Chairman’s revocable trust and includes current stockholders of the Company. On May 24, 2022, the lease was renewed for a period of five years, ending June 30, 2028, and is being accounted for as an operating lease. The lease extension maintained the rent at a fixed rate of $380,000 per year. The Company has the option to renew the lease for an additional five years beginning July 1, 2028 and ending June 30, 2033 under the same terms and conditions except that the annual rent will increase to $397,000. The negotiated increase in rent slated for 2028 will be the first increase in rent since 1996. The Company is responsible for all property maintenance, insurance, taxes, and other normal expenses related to ownership. The facility is in good repair and, in the opinion of management, is suitable and adequate for the Company’s business purposes.‎

Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have made estimates and we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to doubtful accounts, product returns, excess inventories, warranties, impairment of long-lived assets, deferred compensation, income taxes and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, taking into consideration certain possible adverse impacts from inflation, recently enacted tariffs, the economic sanctions imposed on the international community as a result of the continued conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and any changes to the global economic situation as a consequence of future pandemics. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition Revenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the product, which typically occurs upon shipment from the Company’s facility. There are a very limited number of customers for which control does not pass until they have received the products at their facility. Revenue from product sales is adjusted for estimated warranty obligations and variable consideration, which are detailed below. The Company uses a five-step analysis to determine how revenue is recognized. The underlying principle is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services transfer to the customer. The amount of revenue recognized is to reflect the consideration expected to be received for those goods or services. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on revenue recognition. Accounts Receivable The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current credit worthiness, as determined by the review of the customer’s current credit information. The Company continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses. Accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company establishes an allowance based upon the current expected credit loss impairment model. The Company applies a historical loss rate based upon historic write-offs, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future losses as necessary. The Company may also record a specific reserve for individual accounts if they become aware of specific customer circumstances such as bankruptcy or deterioration in operational results or financial position. These specific reserves are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved. However, the ultimate collectability of the unsecured receivable is dependent upon the financial condition of an individual customer, which could change rapidly and without warning. Inventories The Company values its inventories using standard cost which approximates the lower of first in first out (“FIFO”) cost or net realizable value. Valuing inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value requires the use of estimates and judgment. The Company continues to use the same techniques to value inventories that it has in the past. Our customers may cancel their orders or change purchase volumes. This, or certain additional actions or market developments, could create excess inventory levels, which would impact the valuation of our inventories. Any actions taken by our customers or market developments that could impact the value of our inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or net realizable value valuations. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical and projected usage and production requirements. If the Company is not able to achieve its expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value, the Company would have to adjust its reserves accordingly. When a reserve is established, it creates a new cost basis, which is not increased in the future. Product Warranty Obligations The Company offers a lifetime warranty to consumers in the United States and certain other countries. This lifetime warranty creates a future performance obligation. There are also certain foreign distributors that receive warranty repair parts and replacement headphones to satisfy warranty obligations in those countries. The Company defers revenue to recognize the future obligations related to these warranties. The deferred revenue is based on historical analysis of warranty claims relative to sales. This deferred revenue reflects the Company’s best estimates of the amount of warranty returns and repairs it will experience during those future periods. If
24 Table of Contents
future warranty activity varies from the estimates, the Company will adjust the estimated deferred revenue, which would affect net sales and operating results in the period that such adjustment becomes known. Deferred Compensation The Company’s deferred compensation liability is for a current officer and is calculated based on various assumptions that may include compensation, years of service, expected retirement date, discount rates and mortality tables. The related expense is calculated using the net present value of the expected payments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management makes estimates of life expectancy and discount rates using information available from several sources. In addition, management estimates the expected retirement date for the current officer as that impacts the timing for expected future payments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on deferred compensation. Stock-Based Compensation The Company has a stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described more fully in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 "Compensation - Stock Compensation". Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. The expected term of the options and volatility are estimated using historical experience for the options by vesting period. The risk-free interest rate is calculated based on the expected life of the options. The Company does not estimate forfeitures as they are recognized when they occur. Income Taxes We estimate a provision for income taxes based on the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the fiscal year. If the actual results are different from these estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made. Additionally, discrete items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized. Deferred income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates. Deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period. Additionally, we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred income tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the “more likely than not” criteria. ‎

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of DirectorsKoss Corporation and Subsidiaries Opinion on the Consolidated Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Koss Corporation and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for OpinionThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and the significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements.
The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Deferred CompensationAs described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a deferred compensation agreement with a current officer as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, which is measured at its estimated net present value.
The principal consideration for our determination that deferred compensation should be a critical audit matter was based on the subjective nature of the assumptions estimated and used by management to calculate the deferred compensation liability.
Assumptions subject to estimate included discount rates, mortality rates, and future retirement date.
Changes to these assumptions may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The primary audit procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: We tested the design of controls over the Company’s process for accounting and recording the deferred compensation liability. We evaluated management’s calculation methodology and its compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America regarding deferred compensation liabilities.We tested the discount and mortality rate assumptions used by management to calculate the deferred compensation liability by independently determining our own assumptions based on the relevant facts and circumstances and recalculating the deferred compensation liability utilizing those assumptions.We confirmed with the current officer his expected retirement date.

KOSS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES NATURE OF BUSINESS — Koss Corporation ("Koss"), a Delaware corporation, and its 100%-owned subsidiaries (collectively the "Company"), reports its finances as a single reporting segment, as the Company’s only business line is the design, manufacture and sale of stereo headphones and related accessories. The Company leases its plant and office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The domestic market is served by domestic sales representatives and independent manufacturers' representatives working directly with certain retailers, distributors, and original equipment manufacturers. International markets are served by domestic sales representatives and sales personnel in the Netherlands and the Caucasus region which utilize independent distributors in several foreign countries. The Company has two subsidiaries, Koss Corp B.V. and Koss U.K. Limited ("Koss UK"), which were formed to comply with certain European Union ("EU") requirements. Koss Corp B.V. and Koss UK are non-operating and hold no assets. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION — The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Koss and its subsidiaries, Koss Corp B.V. and Koss UK, which are 100%-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. USE OF ESTIMATES — The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company reclassified certain amounts on its June 30, 2024 balance sheet to enhance clarity and consistency in financial statement reporting. Specifically, short-term deferred revenue liabilities related to estimated volume incentive rebates and sales returns were reclassified to accrued liabilities to reflect that revenue was already recognized on the sales related to these liabilities. To conform with current period presentation, the Company reclassified $60,511 to accrued liabilities at June 30, 2024. This reclassification does not affect the total assets, total liabilities, or equity of the Company. REVENUE RECOGNITION — Revenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the product, which typically occurs upon shipment from the Company's facility. There are a very limited number of customers for which control does not pass until they have received the products at their facility. Revenue from product sales is adjusted for estimated warranty obligations and variable consideration, which are detailed below. The amount of revenue recognized is to reflect the consideration expected to be received for those goods or services.  Warranties - The Company offers a lifetime warranty to consumers in the United States and certain other countries. This lifetime warranty creates a future performance obligation. The Company determines the standalone selling price for this performance obligation using the cost-plus method. There are also certain foreign distributors that receive warranty repair parts and replacement headphones to satisfy warranty obligations in those countries. The Company defers revenue to recognize the future obligations related to these warranties. The deferred revenue is based on historical analysis of warranty claims relative to sales. This deferred revenue reflects the Company's best estimates of the amount of warranty returns and repairs it will experience during those future periods. If future warranty activity varies from the estimates, the Company will adjust the estimated deferred revenue, which would affect net sales and operating results in the period that such adjustment becomes known. The Company typically receives payment for product at the time of shipment or under normal collection terms, which are generally 30-60 days. The Company estimates that the warranty related performance obligation is satisfied within one to three years and therefore uses that same time frame for recognition of the deferred revenue, using amortization of 50% in year 1, 30% in year 2, and 20% in year 3 for domestic sales. Export deferred revenue, where applicable, is recognized over a 12-month period from date of shipment. Reserves for Variable Consideration - Revenue from product sales is recorded at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from returns, rebates, and co-pay assistance that are offered within contracts between the Company and its customers. Overall, these reserves reflect the Company's best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contract. If actual results in the future vary from the estimates, the Company will adjust these estimates, which would affect net sales and operating results in the period such variances become known. Product Returns - The Company generally offers customers a limited right of return. The Company estimates the amount of product sales that may be returned by its customers and records the estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. Product return liabilities are estimated using historical sales and returns information. If actual results in the future vary from the estimates, the Company will adjust these estimates, which would affect net sales and operating results in the period such variances become known. Volume Rebates - The Company offers volume rebates to certain customers in the United States and certain foreign distributors. These volume rebates are tied to sales volume within specified periods. The amount of revenue is reduced for variable consideration related
35 Table of Contents
to customer rebates, which are calculated using expected values and is based on program specific factors such as expected rebate percentages and expected volumes. Changes in such accruals may be required if actual sales volume differs from estimated sales volume, which would affect net sales and operating results in the period such variances become known. Seller Fees – The Company pays fees to a major online marketplace for use of its services. Referral fees, the commission paid to the online platform to cover the costs associated with promoting, advertising, and facilitating product sales to its customers, are calculated as a percentage of the sales price and are imposed on sales of all products sold through the marketplace. When orders are fulfilled by the online marketplace, the Company is assessed fulfillment fees to cover the cost of fulfillment of the order as well as the assumption of risk of inventory control, damages and returns. The fees assessed are based on a product’s category, price, size and weight and are deducted from the sales price of each product prior to remittance to the Company with revenue reported on a net basis. Revenue from orders obtained through the online marketplace, but fulfilled by the Company direct to the end customer, are reported as gross sales and referral fees are recorded as selling expense in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company’s related fulfillment costs are recorded in cost of goods sold. Sales Commissions - The Company has elected the practical expedient of not capitalizing sales commissions. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT — Research and development is primarily comprised of product prototypes and testing. These activities, charged to operations as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, amounted to $213,870 and $238,086 in 2025 and 2024, respectively. ADVERTISING COSTS — Advertising costs included within selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations were $251,966 in 2025 and $142,859 in 2024. Such costs are expensed as incurred. INCOME TAXES — The Company operates as a C Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). Amounts provided for income tax expense (benefit) are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision (benefit) for income taxes. The differences relate principally to different methods used for depreciation and amortization for income tax purposes, net operating loss carryforwards, capitalization requirements of the Code, allowances for doubtful accounts, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, stock-based compensation, warranty reserves, and other income tax-related carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. PATENT COSTS — The Company incurs on-going legal fees and filing costs related to the patent portfolio. These costs are expensed in the period they are incurred since no patent legal costs are probable to provide a future economic benefit.  LOSS PER COMMON SHARE — Loss per common share is calculated under the provisions of Topic 260 in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) which provides for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” loss per share. Basic loss per common share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per common share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings losses of an entity. See Note 11 for additional information on loss per common share. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS — The Company considers depository accounts and investments with a maturity at the date of acquisition and expected usage of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash on deposit at a commercial bank located in the United States of America. The Company periodically has cash balances in excess of insured amounts. The Company has not experienced, and does not expect to incur, any losses on these deposits. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE — Accounts receivable consist of unsecured trade receivables due from customers. An allowance for credit losses is deducted from the cost basis of the receivables and is estimated using the aging method whereby expected credit losses are determined on the basis of how long a receivable has been outstanding as well as historical loss data. The estimates are then adjusted for changes in the risk characteristics of the Company’s customer base, changes in credit practices, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable future forecasts that would impact the collectability of the receivables.
At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the allowance for credit losses was $2,043 and $1,922, respectively. Adjustments of $121 and ($4,105)
were made during the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, to record the appropriate allowance per the aging method. No write-offs were necessary and there were no recoveries on prior losses in fiscal years 2025 and 2024. As such, the impact of the change on the Company’s financial statements was not significant. The opening balance of accounts receivable was $1,379,517 at June 30, 2023, net of the allowance for credit losses of $6,027.

PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS — Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist primarily of advance payments for software subscriptions and other services to be received in future periods, partial downpayments for inventory not yet received and a refund due from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for overpayment of improperly withheld amounts for Social Security and Medicare (“FICA”) taxes on the taxable gains resulting from disqualifying dispositions of Incentive Stock Options (ISO) beginning in fiscal year 2021.
The Company has reimbursed the employees for the over withheld taxes.
As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the net refund expected from the IRS is $491,677 and $722,498, respectively, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. INVESTMENTS — Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity as the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. The securities are carried at amortized cost as current or noncurrent based upon maturity date and unrealized gains and losses are recognized when realized. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount to maturity. Such amortization or accretion is included in interest income, along with other interest on cash and cash equivalents. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity debt securities is shown separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is not included in any estimate for credit losses. No allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity U.S. Treasury securities is recorded as these securities have the following characteristics that support a zero-loss expectation: they are explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are consistently highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. See Note 4 for additional information on investments. INVENTORIES — As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company’s inventory was recorded using standard cost which approximates the lower of first in first out (“FIFO”) cost or net realizable value. The carrying value of inventory is reviewed for impairment on at least a quarterly basis, or more frequently if warranted due to changes in market conditions. See Note 5 for additional information on inventory. EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS — Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Major expenditures for leasehold improvements and equipment and significant renewals are capitalized. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, their costs and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are included in operations. See Note 6 for additional information on equipment and leasehold improvements. LEASES — The Company determines if a contract is a lease at the date of inception. The Company leases its facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from Koss Holdings, LLC, which is controlled by five equal ownership interests in trusts held by the five beneficiaries of the former chairman’s revocable trust and includes current stockholders of the Company. The lease agreement provides the Company the right to substantially all of the economic benefits and direct the use of the building, thus is considered a lease. The agreement does not convey ownership of the building to the lessee at the end of the lease term, does not contain an option to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term and the lease term is not for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset so is accounted for as an operating lease. Operating leases are reported on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets and operating lease liabilities. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are valued at the present value of the future lease payment obligations. The Company uses a rate based upon current incremental borrowing rates to determine the present value of future lease payments as the rate is not implicit in the lease. Operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease taking into account expected renewal periods.  LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES — Life insurance policies are stated at cash surrender value or at the amount the Company would receive in the case of split-dollar arrangements. Increases in cash surrender value, net of annual premiums paid, and the proceeds from company-owned life insurance policies are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and other income, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. DEFERRED COMPENSATION —At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company’s deferred compensation liability is for a current officer and is calculated based on years of service and compensation, along with various assumptions related to expected retirement date, discount rates, and mortality tables. The related expense is calculated using the net present value of the expected payments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 10 for additional information on deferred compensation.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS — Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an ordinary transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-tier hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted market prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore, requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
The asset's or liability's fair value measurement within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value based on the short maturity of these instruments. The Company’s U.S. treasury debt securities are recorded at amortized cost with fair value disclosure. They have a readily available market price (Level 1 input), thus a lesser degree of judgment needs to be used in measuring fair value, and fair value was determined by quoted market prices. The fair value is based upon quoted market prices and is disclosed in Note 4. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS — The Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Management determines fair value using an undiscounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques. No impairments of the Company's long-lived assets were recorded in the years ended June 30, 2025 or 2024. LEGAL COSTS — All legal costs related to litigation, for which the Company is liable, are charged to operations as incurred, except contingent legal fees as described below. Proceeds from the settlement of legal disputes are recorded in other income when theamounts are determinable, and the collection is certain. License proceeds are considered functional and as such are recorded at a point in time, based on the underlying agreement. Related contingent legal fees and expenses are recorded in selling, general andadministrative expense at that time. Changes to the contingent legal fee expenses could have a material impact on the results of operations. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION — The Company has a stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described more fully in Note 12. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation”. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. 2.    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU expands annual and interim segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and are included in each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The amendments also require disclosure of an amount for “other segment items” and additional interim information about segment profit or loss and assets. The Company has a single reportable segment. Upon adoption of ASU 2023-07, the Company will be required to provide annual and interim disclosures of significant expense categories such as cost of goods sold, selling and general and administrative expenses when those amounts are regularly provided to the CODM, as well as a description of other segment items. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. Because ASU 2023-07 relates solely to disclosure requirements, adoption does not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
See Note 18 for additional information. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU focuses on income tax disclosures around effective tax rates and cash income taxes paid and requires consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction and certain other amendments. The new guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, or the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. Management is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
38 Table of Contents
In March 2024, FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Certain Income Statement Expenses, which was subsequently amended by ASU 2025-01 in January 2025 to clarify and refine certain requirements. The ASU requires public business entities to disclose in the notes to the financial statements the amounts of employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and inventory costs included in each relevant income statement line item. The guidance also requires disclosure of other expense categories if they are significant to an understanding of the entity’s financial performance. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027 and entities are required to apply the amendments retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will evaluate the impact of these standards on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. While the adoption of ASU 2024-03 and ASU 2025-01 will not affect the Company’s recognition, measurement or presentation of expenses on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Operations, it is expected to result in expanded disclosures in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has not yet determined whether it will early adopt the guidance.  3.    REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company disaggregates its net sales by geographical location as it believes it best depicts how the nature, timing and uncertainty of net sales and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The following table summarizes net sales by geographical location:
2025 2024United States$ 8,968,799 $ 9,795,438Export
3,655,371
2,469,631Net Sales$ 12,624,170 $ 12,265,069 Deferred revenue relates primarily to consumer and customer warranties. These constitute future performance obligations, and the Company defers revenue related to these future performance obligations. Effective July 1, 2023, the Company increased its deferral rates from 2.4% to 3% for domestic sales and decreased its deferral rate from 10% to 8% for export sales to reflect recent warranty experience. The Company recognized revenue, which was included in the deferred revenue liability at the beginning of the periods, of $230,192 and $308,851 in the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, for performance obligations related to consumer and customer warranties. The deferred revenue liability was $422,303 as of June 30, 2023. The Company estimates that the deferred revenue performance obligations are satisfied within 1 to 3 years and therefore uses the same time frame for recognition of the deferred revenue.

7.    INCOME TAXES The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes. The liability method measures the expected income tax impact of future taxable income and deductions implicit in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The income tax provision (benefit) in 2025 and 2024 consisted of the following:

$ 17,482 $ (73,604) During the year ended June 30, 2025, a federal tax provision of $5,570 was recorded for the uncertain tax position related to research and development (R&D) credits taken in a prior year. State income tax expense of $11,912, which represented only the required minimum estimated state tax payments due, combined with the federal tax expense for a total income tax expense of $17,482. For the year ended June 30, 2024, a federal tax benefit of $81,278 was recorded as a result of the Return-to-Provision (RTP) adjustment. State tax expense of $7,674 was also recorded in that same period for the required minimum state tax payments. For the year ended June 30, 2025, another $1,150,000 was added to the NOL balance as a result of taxable net losses generated. For NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) limits the NOL deduction to 80 percent of taxable income. As such, the utilization of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards from fiscal years after 2018 is limited to 80 percent of the resulting taxable income.
Temporary differences which give rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities at June 30, 2025 and 2024 include:

(692,707)Net deferred income tax assets $— $— Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. These differences are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. The recognition of these deferred tax balances will be realized through normal recurring operations and, as such, the Company has recorded the value of such expected benefits. The Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $34,000,000 which can be carried forward indefinitely and state net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $11,231,000 in Wisconsin, which expire in tax years 2029 through 2044 and approximately $15,367,000 in other states. Given a taxable net loss for fiscal year 2025, it is expected that $1,150,000 will be added to the Company’s federal net operating loss carryforwards and, given recurring taxable losses with the exception of fiscal year 2023 whereby taxable income was generated mainly as a result of non-recurring license proceeds, the future realization of this continues to be uncertain. The valuation allowance was adjusted to continue to fully offset the deferred tax asset as there is sufficient negative evidence to support a full valuation
41 Table of Contents
allowance. For the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company added federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,270,000 as a result of a taxable net loss for that fiscal year.
The need for a valuation allowance is evaluated each accounting period based on the Company’s evaluation of positive and negative evidence concerning the usage of their deferred tax assets. As of the end of the period, the Company has evaluated all evidence concerning the usage of their deferred tax assets and the determination has been made to maintain a full valuation allowance on the Company’s net deferred tax asset. The need for a valuation allowance is an estimate at period-end, which is subject to change once additional evidence is obtained in future periods.
Balance, Decrease (Increase)
beginning in valuation Balance,Years Ended June 30, of year allowance end of year2025 $ (10,176,697) $ (207,877) $ (10,384,574)2024 $ (9,906,018) $ (270,679) $ (10,176,697) Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. Due to positive taxable income in prior years, a significant portion of the Company’s federal R&D tax credits were taken, including carryovers. The claim for research and development (R&D) tax credits continues to be a highly scrutinized area by the Internal Revenue Service and, while the Company is confident in its credit claim, it cannot anticipate the impact that future guidance could have on current claims. Due to the costs of defense, the Company may also decide to settle for less than the full amount of the credits used on the returns. As a result, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that upon audit, the realization of the credits used would be 80% and accordingly recorded a liability as a reserve for an uncertain tax position (“UTP”) related to the R&D credits taken. The UTP balance is $38,100 and $28,200 at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The UTP increased during 2025 due to an additional credit amount utilized with the fiscal year 2024 tax return. The reserve for UTP is recorded in income taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. There were no other matters determined to be unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that have been recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. Additionally, GAAP provides guidance on the recognition of interest and penalties related to income taxes. No interest or penalties related to income taxes has been accrued or recognized as of and for the years ended June 30, 2025 or 2024. The Company records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits, when applicable, in interest expense. The Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in several state jurisdictions. The Company’s federal tax returns and state income tax returns are open for the standard statutory period. 8.    CREDIT FACILITY On May 14, 2019, the Company entered into a secured credit facility ("Credit Agreement") with Town Bank (“Lender”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $5,000,000 revolving secured credit facility and letters of credit for the benefit of the Company of up to a sublimit of $1,000,000. There are no unused line fees in the credit facility. On January 28, 2021, the Credit Agreement was amended to extend the expiration to October 31, 2022, and to change the interest rate to Wall Street Journal Prime less 1.50%. An amendment to the Credit Agreement effective October 30, 2024, extended the maturity date to October 31, 2026, and removed one of the covenants requiring submission of annual financial performance projections to the Lender. The Company and the Lender also entered into a General Business Security Agreement dated May 14, 2019, under which the Company granted the Lender a security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets in connection with the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on other indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, certain investments, disposition of assets, mergers, and liquidations, among other restrictions. As of June 30, 2025, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings on the facility and there was no interest expense recognized during the years then ended. ‎

10.    DEFERRED COMPENSATION  As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company has a deferred compensation agreement with a current officer. The related expense is calculated using the net present value of the expected payments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company's non-current deferred compensation obligation is recorded as deferred compensation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The deferred compensation liability of $2,226,454 and $2,093,142 recorded at June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively, relates to a supplemental retirement plan for a current officer that calls for annual cash compensation following retirement from the Company in an amount equal to 2% of base salary, as defined in the agreement, multiplied by the number of years of service to the Company. The retirement payments are to be paid monthly to the officer until his death and then to his surviving spouse monthly until her death. Deferred compensation expense of $133,330 and $96,004 was recognized under this arrangement during the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, to record the liability at net present value of the future expected payments. The net present value was calculated using a discount factor of 5.81% and 5.55% at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The life expectancies used in the calculation of net present value were 17.30 and 18.10 years for fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in the deferred compensation expense recorded in the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the prior year was due mainly to the annual increase in the future payments under the arrangement along with the reduction in the time period before payments commence, offset partially by the increase in the discount factor. The current officer's retirement date is estimated to be October 2029. 11.    LOSS PER COMMON SHARE Basic loss per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per common share is calculated assuming the exercise of stock options except where the result would be anti-dilutive. The following table reconciles the numerator and denominator used to calculate basic and diluted loss per share:

12.    STOCK OPTIONS  In July 2023, pursuant to the recommendation of the Board of Directors, the shareholders approved the creation of the Koss Corporation 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”). Concurrently with the adoption of the new plan, the Koss Corporation 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”) was terminated. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the 2023 Plan and provides for the granting of various stock-based incentive awards to eligible participants, primarily officers and certain key employees of the Company. 2,000,000 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the 2023 Plan, plus any shares subject to awards remaining outstanding under the 2012 Plan that expired or are otherwise forfeited, canceled, or terminated. The Company’s Board of Directors will determine the terms and conditions under which an option will become exercisable but expects that stock options granted under the 2023 Plan will vest over a three-to-five-year period from the date of grant. An option will expire no more than ten years from its grant date, with the exception of incentive stock options held by a 10% stockholder, which will expire no more than five years from the grant date. As with the 2012 Plan, pursuant to the 2023 Plan, new shares will be issued upon exercise of stock options. As of June 30, 2025, no new stock-based awards have been granted under the 2023 Plan. The fair value of each stock option grant under the 2012 Plan was estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The resulting compensation cost for fixed awards with graded vesting schedules is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The expected term of awards granted was determined based on historical experience with similar awards, giving consideration to the expected term and vesting schedules. The expected volatility was determined based on the Company’s historical stock prices over the most recent period commensurate with the expected term of the award. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term commensurate with the expected term of the award. As of June 30, 2025, there was $1,473 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted under the 2012 Plan. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.06 years. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $31,782 and $155,834 in 2025 and 2024, respectively. These expenses were included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The following table identifies options granted, exercised, canceled, or available for exercise pursuant to the 2012 Plan:

13.    STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM In April 1995, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase from time to time up to $2,000,000 of its common stock for its own account. Subsequently, the Board of Directors periodically approved increases in the amount authorized for repurchase under the program. As of June 30, 2025, the repurchase of an aggregate of $45,500,000 of common stock was authorized under the stock repurchase program, of which $43,360,247 had been expended. No shares were repurchased in fiscal year 2025 or 2024.  14.    LEASES The Company leases its facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from Koss Holdings, LLC, which is controlled by five equal ownership interests in trusts held by the five beneficiaries of the former Chairman’s revocable trust and includes current stockholders of the Company. On May 24, 2022, the lease was renewed for a period of five years, ending June 30, 2028 (the “Extended Term”), and is being accounted for as an operating lease. The lease extension maintained the rent at a fixed rate of $380,000 per year and included an option to renew at an increased rate of $397,000 for an additional five years ending June 30, 2033 (the “Second Extended Term”). The negotiated increase in rent slated for 2028 will be the first increase in rent since 1996. The Company is responsible for all property maintenance, insurance, taxes, and other normal expenses related to ownership. The Company used its incremental borrowing rate as of the date of renewal, May 24, 2022, to recalculate the net present value of the operating lease ROU asset and liability. Both the Extended Term and the Second Extended Term renewal options were included in the calculation of the ROU asset and liability as the Company believes it is reasonably certain to exercise both rights to renew. The non-lease components of the agreement related to common area maintenance charges are accounted for separately. Supplemental information related to lease expense and valuation of the ROU asset and liability was as follows:

The lease is described more fully in Note 14.  16.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company amended and restated its Koss Employee Stock Ownership Trust (“KESOT”) effective July 1, 2023 and received approval from the Board of Directors on July 26, 2023. Substantially all domestic employees are participants in the KESOT under which an annual contribution in either cash or common stock may be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. All contributions to date have been fully allocated to employees’ company contribution accounts. No contributions were made for the years ended June 30, 2025 or 2024, respectively.  The Company maintains a retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan covers all employees of the Company who have completed one full fiscal quarter of service. Matching contributions can be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. For fiscal years 2025 and 2024, the matching contribution was 25% of employee contributions to the plan. Vesting of Company contributions occurs immediately. Company contributions were $79,240 and $80,831 during 2025 and 2024, respectively. 17.    CONCENTRATIONS In the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company’s largest concentration of sales came from DTC through the Amazon portal and were approximately 19% and 17% of net sales in fiscal year 2025 and 2024, respectively. The five largest customers of the Company accounted for approximately 50% of net sales in fiscal year 2025 and 46% in fiscal year 2024.
The three customers with individual accounts receivable balances greater than 10% as of June 30, 2025 were Access Catalog, Ingram Micro and Amazon Vendor Central. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, accounts receivable from Access Catalog represented 16% and less than 10% of total trade accounts receivable, respectively, Ingram Micro accounts receivable represented 13% and 18%, respectively, and Amazon Vendor Central accounts receivable represented approximately 11% and 15%, respectively. The Computer Supply People accounts receivable as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 was less than 10% and 12%, respectively. The majority of international customers, outside of Canada, purchase products on a cash against documents or cash in advance basis. Approximately 5% of the Company's trade accounts receivable at both June 30, 2025 and 2024, were foreign receivables denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company uses contract manufacturing facilities in the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan. The majority of the contract manufacturing is done by two vendors with one vendor representing approximately 68% and 65% of the manufacturing costs in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company has a long-term relationship with this vendor. However, increased costs from the vendor or an interruption of supply from this vendor could have a material adverse effect on the Company's profit margins and profitability. 18.    SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company has a single reportable segment, the design, manufacture and sale of headphones and related accessories, which reflects the manner in which the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company’s CODM, regularly reviews financial information to manage the business, allocate resources and assess performance. The headphones are sold through retailers and distributors both domestically and internationally, as well as direct-to-consumer.

37,199,479 The Company applied the provisions of ASU 2023-07 retrospectively and has included comparative information for the year ended June 30, 2024.
Because the Company operates as a single reportable segment, the amounts above reconcile directly to the corresponding consolidated financial statement line items. There was no impact on previously reported consolidated net income, financial position or cash flows. 19.    LEGAL MATTERS As of June 30, 2025, the Company is involved in the following matters described below: As previously reported, the Company maintains a program focused on enforcing its intellectual property and, in particular, certain of its patent portfolio. The Company has filed complaints against certain parties alleging infringement on the Company’s patents relating to its wireless audio technology. In the event that a monetary award or judgment is received by the Company in connection with these complaints, all or portions of such amounts, such as contingent legal fees, will be due to third parties. The Company may incur additional fees and costs related to these lawsuits, however, timing and impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements is uncertain. Depending on the response to and the underlying results of the enforcement program, the Company may continue to litigate its claims, enter into licensing arrangements or reach some other outcome potentially advantageous to its competitive position.
In early fiscal year 2020, the Company was notified by One-E-Way, Inc. that some of the Company's wireless products may infringe on certain One-E-Way patents. A Supplemental Notice of Infringement was sent to the Company on March 18, 2025. The Company is investigating the merits of the notice. Depending on the results of the investigation and the defense of these allegations, the ultimate resolution of this matter may have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company estimates that this matter will ultimately be resolved at a cost of approximately $41,000 and has accrued this amount in accrued liabilities as of June 30, 2025 and 2024. The ultimate resolution of these matters is not determinable unless otherwise noted. We are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving these claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company leases a reach truck under a financing lease arrangement. The lease has a non-cancelable term of 36 months and requires monthly payments of $990, due on the first day of each month, beginning July 1, 2025. The lease contains a $1 purchase option at the end of the lease term that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, and at which time ownership of the lift truck will transfer to the Company. At lease commencement, the Company recognized a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding lease liability of $31,716, representing the present value of lease payments discounted at the current borrowing rate per the lessor of 7.75%. The ROU asset will be presented within Other Assets and will be amortized over the lease term. The lease liability will be presented within Current and Long-Term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.On July 4, 2025, the U.S. Congress enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBB Act”), which introduced significant tax changes such as making permanent many of the provisions of the TCJA, while introducing new, or restructuring other, tax policies. The provisions include modification to corporate tax rates, expensing rules for research and development, restoration of the 100% bonus depreciation deduction, treatment of foreign income and various other changes to credits and deductions.
The Company will assess the specific financial statement implications and evaluate the impacts on income taxes payable, deferred tax assets and liabilities (including valuation allowances), and the effective tax rate, in accordance with ASC 740. Given the complexity of the legislation and the variables involved, management is currently unable to reasonably estimate the financial impact on the Company. ‎
