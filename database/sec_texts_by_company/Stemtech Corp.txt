CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Some of the statements contained in this annual
report may constitute “forward-looking statements” for purposes of the federal securities laws. Our forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies
regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or
circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,”
“continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,”
“plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,”
“would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that
a statement is not forward-looking.
The forward-looking statements contained in this
annual report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There
can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve
a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance
to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include,
but are not limited to, the following risks, uncertainties and other factors:
·
The
implementation of our strategic plans for our business;
·
Our
financial performance;
·
Developments
relating to our competitors and our industry, including the impact of government regulation;
·

Item 1C. Cybersecurity.
Risk Management
We recognize
the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems
and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. We currently have security measures in place to protect our
clients, customers, employees, and vendor information and prevent data loss and other security breaches. We also only use third party
software for accounting, billing and payroll that have successful SOC 1 type 2 compliance. Both management and the Board are actively
involved in the continuous assessment of risks from cybersecurity threats, including prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation
of cybersecurity incidents.
Our current
cybersecurity risk assessment program consists of an annual review of our risks and policies. The program outlines governance, policies
and procedures, and technology we use to oversee and identify risks from cybersecurity threats.
Our President
& COO and CEO are responsible for overseeing our business operations and are responsible for day-to-day assessment and management
of risks from cybersecurity threats, including the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. We also
use the services of an outside consulting firm to monitor activity and advise the company of cybersecurity protocols.
We routinely
undertake activities to prevent, detect, and minimize the effects of cybersecurity incidents, including an annual risk review, policy
reviews and revisions. In addition, we maintain business continuity, contingency, and recovery plans for use in the event of a cybersecurity
incident by the administering of local and cloud based back up of files. and emails.
We engaged
and used the advice of a third-party consultant to help us assess and identify risks from cybersecurity threats, including the threat
of a cybersecurity incident, and manage our risk assessment program. Among other things, these providers have recommended periodic evaluations
of the work stations.
We have multiple controls in place in order to prevent breaches,
some of these controls include:
a.FMA/2FA, this is our first AND most important first line of defense, no one should
have MFA bypassed or disabled, with no exceptions.
b.Email Banner for external emails. This banner assists us to identify any phishing / impersonation email
and cannot be bypassed.
c.Conditional Access Policy (CAP): Rejects connections to Exchange Online from un-authorized
countries. We are further enhancing this control by implementing ACL's (access lists) in our CRM and ERP systems and any other mission
critical platform. ALL platforms should have MFA enforced, any platform not supporting MFA in 2024 is deemed high-risk and immediately
replaced as it is obsolete and poses high-risk to the Company.
As of the
date of this report, no cybersecurity incident (or aggregation of incidents) or cybersecurity threat has materially affected our results
of operations or financial condition. However, an actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation and cause existing
Independent Business Partners (IBPs or distributors) / customers to discontinue, as well as prevent us from attracting new clients / customers.
and / or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our
business, operating results or financial condition. We currently do not carry a cyber liability insurance policy, but are evaluating whether
to acquire one to mitigate any financial impact of a cybersecurity breach.
Item 2. Properties.
Not Applicable.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
On August
6, 2019, the former CEO (prior to the Company’s bankruptcy proceedings) filed a lawsuit against the Company’s subsidiary,
Stemtech HealthSciences Corp., alleging unpaid salary and vacation pay related to a period prior to the current management team assuming
control in 2018. The total claim is for approximately $267,000. The Company has filed a counterclaim against the former CEO and considers
his claims to be without merit.

Penny Stock Rules
Trading in Stemtech’s Common
Stock is subject to the “penny stock” rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has adopted regulations
that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain
exceptions.
These rules require that any broker-dealer
who recommends Stemtech’s Common Stock to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors, must, prior to the sale,
make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to execute the
transaction. Unless an exception is available, the regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock,
of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market. In addition,
broker- dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for
the securities they offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from
effecting transactions in Stemtech’s securities, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of Stemtech’s
securities. The application of the “penny stock” rules may affect your ability to resell Stemtech’s securities.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion should
be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following
discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Stemtech’s actual results could differ
materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include
but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report. Stemtech’s audited financial statements are stated
in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Company Overview
Stemtech Corporation and its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the “Company”, or “Stemtech”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, USA on September 4, 2009 under the name
Globe Net Wireless Corp. with ticker symbol “GNTW”. Our corporate name was changed to Stemtech Corporation in the state of
Nevada.in August 2021. On August 19, 2021, Stemtech Corporation (“Stemtech”), a (Delaware corporation), entered into a Merger
Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Globe Net Wireless Corp. (“Globe Net” or “GNTW”) in exchange
for the issuance of 37,060,000 shares of the Company, approximately 85% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company. On November
19, 2021, the Company adopted an Amendment to its Articles changing the name of the Corporation to Stemtech Corporation in the state of
Nevada, and on April 14, 2022, FINRA gave final approval for said name change. Stemtech has pioneered and patented a whole new category
of stem cell dietary supplements.
Stemtech’s patented, advanced Stem Cell
Nutrition formulations are one-of-a-kind natural products designed to help support the three most important aspects of stem cell physiology
found in our RCM System: 1) Releasing the body’s own stem cells slowing down the bodies aging process; 2) their Circulation in the
blood; and 3) Migration into tissues, where they can perform their daily anti-aging and longevity function of renewal and rejuvenation
for optimal health. We harness the incredible power of adult stem cells. How does this work? Adult stem cells are released from your body’s
own bone marrow into the bloodstream, they then circulate in the bloodstream and flow into the tissues and organs most in need. As they
arrive, the adult stem cells migrate into the tissues, reproduce and become new, healthy cells of those tissues. This process takes place
every single day, even without tissue damage, as part of the natural renewal system of the body. It is important to understand that Stemtech’s
patented products do not contain stem cells. They are composed of all-natural plant-based botanicals and other ingredients that have been
clinically documented to support the release and performance of your own adult stem cells essentially allowing the human body to heal
itself naturally. Stemtech also offers our all-natural OraStem® toothpaste, which is a tooth whitener, breath freshener,
anti-microbial, stem cell attracting and promotes good gum health. OraStem prevents bacteria from further entering the body and spreading
germs to vital organs.
In December 2022, our new Cellect One®
Rapid Renew Stem Cell Peptide Night Cream. The Night Cream is a Stemtech proprietary formula containing an FDA patented ingredient, Red
Oak Bark, which enables deep penetration to promote good skin health. In 2025, we introduced Cellect One® Shield: HOCL
(Hypochlorous Acid) skin care mist, which supports healthier skin, kills germs as a disinfectant, supports wound care and odor elimination.
Stemtech announced it will introduce StemPets™, a pet supplement like our RCM for humans to our furry family members in April 2025.
The global pet industry is a $303 Billion market.
While sales of products obviously create the cash
flow, our real business model is not just “sales”, but lateral penetration. We do this through our IBPs - “Independent
Business Partner” Sales Force, and we invest much energy in growing our IBPs. Post funding, Stemtech is projecting the addition
of 30,000 new independent business partner reps over the next 12 to 24 months, adding to the existing IBPs. IBPs are incentivized to build
their network, attracting additional industry leaders. IBPs are a testimonial to our product and business model, lowering our customer
acquisition costs. Our IBPs offer highly flexible yet steady income which is most adapted to todays “Laptop & Cellphone Lifestyle”,
with structured and organized weekly Corporate training calls, a personalized website, back-office tracking, oversight and management
Tools, Reports, Training Materials and Social Sharing. Management conservatively believes we can reinvigorate sales to be more consistent
with the company’s previous revenue historically, as Stemtech has been recognized 4 times in the Inc 5000 Magazine’s list
of fastest growing companies. Below this IBP level, we plan to have our “DTC” (Direct To Consumer) network marketing Distribution
model. This integrative model allows us an immediate global presence and ability to operate in multiple countries on every continent.
With a 10% money back guarantee, This method requires no up-front or required buy-in of inventory by customers, with monthly shipments
available for known recurring sales. This platform has us now operating at the intersection of the ecommerce economy, social economy and
gig economy.

Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Such consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations
of the Company’s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. All intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
Critical Accounting Policies
This Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions
and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the
related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that
management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews
the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly
and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results
could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
Our significant accounting policies
are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere
in this report.
5
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of
our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and related disclosures. Management believes that there
are no critical accounting estimates in these consolidated financial statements.
New Accounting Pronouncements
We do not expect recent accounting
pronouncements will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 2 in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Results of Operations
Our consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability
and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect
we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among
other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.
Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared
to the Year Ended December 31, 2023.
During the years ended December
31, 2024 and 2023, net sales were $5,053,690 and $4,921,531, respectively. The increase of $132,159 is primarily due to slight increases
in the overall sales of the subsidiaries due to the increase in IBPs in 2024.
During the years ended December
31, 2024 and 2023, our total operating expenses were $6,113,773 and $8,144,439, respectively, reflecting a favorable decrease of $2,030,664.
This improvement was primarily driven by effective cost management initiatives, including a reduction in general and administrative expenses,
which decreased to $5,233,823 in 2024 from $6,439,537 in 2023.
During the years ended December
31, 2024 and 2023, total non-operating expenses were $1,386,274 and $1,207,433, respectively, reflecting a modest increase of $178,841.
This increase was primarily due to the absence in 2024 of gains from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities and settlements
of derivative liabilities, which contributed $1,488,686 and $1,366,298, respectively, in 2023. Offsetting this impact, interest expense
decreased significantly to $1,579,370 in 2024 from $4,893,033 in 2023, reflecting improved debt management and reduced financing costs.
We also recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $107,733 in 2024, compared to $814,132 in the prior year. Other income and expenses,
net, increased modestly to $85,363 in 2024 from $16,484 in 2023.
Our net loss for the years ended December
31, 2024 and 2023 was $3,772,701 and $5,431,979, respectively. The year-over-year improvement in net loss was primarily driven by reductions
in operating expenses and interest expense, partially offset by the absence of derivative-related gains recognized in the prior year as
mentioned above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In spite of increasing revenues, we
are not yet profitable, and we cannot provide any assurance of when we will be profitable. We incurred a net loss of $3,772,701 and $5,431,979
for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we met our short-term liquidity
needs through existing cash reserves and financing activities. These included proceeds from notes payable of $274,689, net proceeds from
a factoring arrangement of $529,667, and stock issued for cash of $474,812. These inflows were partially offset by repayments of notes
payable totaling $282,034. As a result, net cash provided by financing activities was $1,079,110 for the year.
As of December 31, 2024, our current
assets totaled $921,746, compared to $400,710 as of December 31, 2023, reflecting an improvement in liquidity. Our current liabilities
increased to $9,009,049 as of December 31, 2024, from $6,462,036 at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by financing
obligations and trade-related payables. Current liabilities as of December 31, 2024, consisted of $4,518,391 in accounts payable and accrued
expenses, $1,769,583 in convertible notes payable, $2,046,001 in non-convertible notes payable, $673,611 in factoring liabilities, and
$1,463 in deferred revenues.
Stockholders’ deficit increased
to $5,226,804 as of December 31, 2024, from $2,778,765 as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the net loss incurred
during the year, partially offset by the conversion of convertible notes and the reclassification of derivative liabilities to equity.
6
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
We have not generated positive cash
flows from operating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was $601,198, primarily due
to a net loss of $3,772,701 partially offset by non-cash adjustments of $1,789,721 and changes in working capital.
The non-cash adjustments included depreciation
and amortization of $344,466, amortization of right-of-use assets of $70,820, stock compensation expense of $440,256, amortization of
debt discount of $362,404, stock issued for services of $746,374, and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $107,733, partially offset by
a $66,866 adjustment for operating lease liabilities.
Changes in operating assets and liabilities
included an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1,809,485, a decrease in accounts receivable of $208,255, a decrease
in inventory of $149,030, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $22,619, an increase in long-term deposits of $6,776,
and a decrease in deferred revenues of $54,576.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
We have financed our operations primarily
through the issuance of common stock and proceeds from debt arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing
activities was $1,079,110. This included $274,689 in proceeds from notes payable, $81,976 from related party notes, $529,667 from a factoring
arrangement, and $474,812 from the issuance of common stock. These inflows were partially offset by repayments of notes payable totaling
$282,034.
Plan of Operation and Funding
We expect that working capital
requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of equity securities and debt
instruments.
Existing working capital, further
advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months.
Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection
with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition
of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these
expenses with further issuances of securities and director loans. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate
revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution
to our current shareholders. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available
or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities,
which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months
in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we
anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We have and will continue
to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for additional loans has been made. We do not have
any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of the date of this report,
we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material to investors.
Stockholders’ Deficit
Authorized Shares
Effective May 5, 2023, the Company
is authorized to issue up to 400,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value. Prior to May 5, 2023, the Company was authorized to
issue up to 200,000,000 shares (see Note 9). Each outstanding share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote per share on all matters
submitted to a stockholder vote. All shares of common stock are non-assessable and non-cumulative, with no pre-emptive rights.
7
Commitments and Contingencies
None.
Financing
On March 27, 2023, the Company
entered into a Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note with Leviston Resources, LLC for a maximum principal amount of up to $7,000,000,
subject to disbursement at the lender’s discretion. To date, Leviston Resources LLC has disbursed four tranches totaling $1,561,660,
consisting of $1,000,000, $250,000, $250,000, and $61,660, respectively. The latest disbursement adheres to the terms of the note and
prior funding obligations. The note bears interest at 7% per annum and is convertible into common stock at a conversion price initially
set at 125% of the closing bid price on the disbursement date, subject to adjustment thereafter.
Future financing through equity
investments is likely to be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, the terms of securities we may issue in future capital transactions
may be more favorable for our new investors. Newly issued securities may include preferences, superior voting rights, and the issuance
of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have additional dilutive effects. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing
future capital and financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, and other costs. We may also be required
to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which will
adversely impact our financial condition.
Our ability to obtain needed financing
may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets, both generally and specifically in the nutraceutical industry, which could impact
the availability or cost of future financing. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our
revenue from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, even to the extent that we reduce our operations accordingly,
we may be required to cease operations.
We have no plans, arrangements or contingencies
in place in the event that we cease operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Shareholders
Stemtech Corporation and Subsidiaries
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stemtech
Corporation and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and the related consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for the period ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and classification of liabilities
and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result
if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period
audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex
judgements. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

(collectively, the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, USA on September 4, 2009 under the previous
name Globe Net Wireless Corp. On November 19, 2021, the Company adopted an Amendment to its Articles changing the name of the Corporation
to Stemtech Corporation in the state of Nevada, and on April 14, 2022, FINRA gave final approval for said name change, as evidenced by
the 8-K filed that date. Stemtech is a global network marketing company that develops science-based products that it believes supports
wellness by helping the body maintain healthy stem cell physiology, also known as stem cell enhancers. Known as the Stem Cell Nutrition

and recapitalization in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations. Management evaluated the guidance contained in ASC 805 with respect to the identification
of the acquirer in the merger and concluded, based on a consideration of the pertinent facts and circumstances, that Stemtech acquired
Globe Net for financial accounting purposes. On November 9, 2021, the Company changed its fiscal year end from a fiscal year end of August
31 to a calendar year end of December 31.

Note 2 — Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements
of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”) and considering the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets
and classification of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
do not reflect any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
The Company has experienced recurring
net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $30.8 million and a
working capital deficiency of approximately $8.1 million at December 31, 2024. The Company has funded its activities to date almost exclusively
from debt and equity financing. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company will continue to require substantial funds to implement its new investment acquisition plans. Management’s plans in
order to meet its operating cash flow requirements include financing activities such as private placements of its common stock, preferred
stock offerings, and issuances of debt and convertible debt instruments.
The Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements depends on its ability
to execute its business plan, increase revenue, and reduce expenditures. The Company has reduced its labor force, cut out significant
overhead and increased sales in attempts to address the above.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash
The Company considers all highly
liquid temporary investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
The Company cash equivalents $255,298 and $114,166 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company maintains certain cash balances at several
institutions located outside the United States. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed
to any significant credit risk.
F-7
Inventory
Inventory is comprised of finished
goods and raw materials and is valued at the lower of cost or market, using the “first-in, first-out” method in determining
cost. Management evaluates the allowance for inventory obsolescence on a regular basis and has determined that no allowance for slow moving
or obsolete inventory is necessary as at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The estimated fair values of acquired
intangibles are generally determined based upon future economic benefits such as earnings and cash flows. Acquired identifiable intangible
assets are recorded at fair value and are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Acquired intangible assets with an indefinite life
are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amounts of those assets are below their estimated fair values. Impairment is tested under ASC 350, Intangibles -
Goodwill and Other.
Goodwill represents the excess
of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not
amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be
impaired. The fair value of the reporting unit is evaluated on qualitative factors to determine if the reported value may be impaired.
If the qualitative factors indicate a likelihood of impairment, we then evaluate carrying value of the reporting unit based on quantitative
factors using the income approach. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting
unit over its implied fair value.
Notes Payable and Convertible Debentures
U.S. GAAP
requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as freestanding derivative financial
instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the
embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b)
the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under
otherwise applicable U.S. GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same
terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument
is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity. See Note 6 –
Notes Payable and Convertible Debentures
Factoring Liability
We have entered
into factoring agreements with various financial institutions to receive cash for our future revenues. These transactions are treated
as a debt instrument and are accounted for as a liability because the Company makes weekly payments towards the balance and fees. We utilize
factoring arrangements as an integral part of our financing for working capital. Any change in the availability of these factoring arrangements
could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. See Note 6 – Notes Payable and Convertible Debentures.
Derivative Liabilities
The Company classifies as equity
any contracts that: (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement; or (ii) provide the Company with a choice of net-cash settlement
or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement) providing that such contracts are indexed to the Company’s
own stock. The Company classifies as assets or liabilities any contracts that: (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement
to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the Company’s control); or (ii) gives the counterparty
a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company assesses classification
of its common stock purchase warrants and other freestanding derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification
between assets and liabilities is required.
The Company’s freestanding
derivatives consisted of warrants to purchase common stock that were issued in connection with the issuance of debt and the sale of common
shares, and of embedded conversion options within convertible notes. The Company evaluated these derivatives to assess their proper classification
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 using the applicable classification criteria enumerated
under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. See Note 7 – Derivative Liabilities
F-8
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company assesses, on an annual
basis, the recoverability of the carrying amount of intangible assets and long-lived assets used in continuing operations. A loss is recognized
when expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest) are less than the carrying amount of the asset. The impairment loss
is determined as the difference by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The Company evaluated its long-lived
assets for any indications of impairment. The Company concluded that there was no impairment, however there can be no assurance that market
conditions will not change or demand for the Company’s products will continue which could result in impairment of long- lived assets
in the future.
Revenue Recognition
It is the Company’s policy
that revenues from product sales is recognized in accordance with ASC 606 Revenues from Contracts with Customers. Five basic steps
must be followed before revenue can be recognized; (1) Identifying the contract(s) with a customer that creates enforceable rights and
obligations; (2) Identifying the performance obligations in the contract, such as promising to transfer goods or services to a customer;
(3) Determining the transaction price, meaning the amount of consideration in a contract to which an entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer; (4) Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract, which requires the Company to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative
standalone selling prices of each distinct good or services promised in the contract; and (5) Recognizing revenue when (or as) the entity
satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized is the amount
allocated to the satisfied performance obligation.
Revenues from direct retail sales
to consumers and revenues from independent distributors occur when title and risk of loss has passed, which generally occurs at the time
the products are shipped. Revenues are recorded net of estimated sales returns and allowances.
Allowances for product returns
are provided at the time the sale is recorded. This liability is based upon historic return rates and the relevant return pattern, which
reflects anticipated returns to be received over a period of up to one year following the original sale. As of both December 31, 2024
and 2023, the Company had a reserve for sales returns of approximately $0 and $7,000, which is included in accrued liabilities in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
We offer various incentives to
our IBPs, such as volume bonuses, commissions, and promotional discounts. These are considered part of variable consideration and are
estimated at the time of sale. The estimate is based on historical trends and our current compensation plans and is recognized as a reduction
to revenue.
Breakage refers to unused credits,
promotional balances, or rewards that are not expected to be redeemed. We estimate the amount of breakage using historical data and recognize
the related income over time, as it becomes clear that these amounts won’t be used.
We regularly monitor and
update these estimates to ensure our revenue recognition remains accurate and consistent with accounting standards.
Comprehensive Loss
The other comprehensive loss in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the net loss of the Company for the respective period as well as unrealized
foreign currency translation adjustments.
F-9
Foreign Currency Translation
A portion of the Company’s
business operations occur outside the United States. The local currency of each of the Company’s subsidiaries is generally its functional
currency. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates existing at the consolidated balance sheet dates,
revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates and stockholders’ deficit is recorded at historical exchange
rates. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders’ deficit in the
consolidated balance sheets and as a component of comprehensive loss. Transaction gains and losses are included in other income (expense),
net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASC 842, Leases, (“ASC 842”) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of
right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases previously classified as operating leases.
The Company adopted ASC 842 effective January 1, 2022 and recognized and measured operating leases existing at, or entered into after,
January 1, 2021 (the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented) using a modified retrospective approach, with certain practical
expedients available (see Note 5). The Company’s accounting for finance leases under ASC 842 remained substantially unchanged,
In accordance with ASC 842, the
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement
date. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease assets represent the Company’s
right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease payments,
initial direct costs, lease incentives, and impairment of operating lease assets. To determine the present value of future lease payments,
the Company estimates the incremental borrowing rates corresponding to the reasonably certain lease term. If the estimate of the Company’s
incremental borrowing rate was changed, the operating lease assets and liabilities could differ materially.
Finance lease assets and liabilities
are recognized at the lease commencement date at the present value of the future lease payments not yet paid using the Company’s
incremental borrowing rate, Assets acquired under finance lease are included in property and equipment, while finance lease obligations
are included in other current liabilities and other long- term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Income Tax
The Company accounts for income
taxes in accordance with ASC 74, Income Taxes. Accordingly, deferred income taxes are determined utilizing the asset and liability
method based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between
financial accounting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities
under the applicable tax law. Deferred tax balances are computed using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences
reverse. Valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets are provided for, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts
more likely than not to be realized.
The Company accounts for uncertain
tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740-10, which prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement
and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements. According to ASC Topic 740-10, tax
positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. The Company’s accounting policy is to classify interest and penalties
relating to uncertain tax positions under income taxes, however the Company did not recognize such items in its fiscal 2024 and 2023 consolidated
financial statements and did not recognize any liability with respect to unrecognized tax positions in its consolidated balance sheet.
F-10
Business Combinations
The Company allocates the
fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, based on their estimated
fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities
is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to
intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows
from acquired customer lists, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates.
Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and
unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition
date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon
the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
Fair Value of the Acquired Assets
The Company accounted for the acquisitions
discussed in Note 4 as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting as prescribed in ASC 805 and ASC 820. In accordance
with ASC 805 and ASC 820, the Company assigned fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, identifiable intangible assets
and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition dates. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of purchase consideration
over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Segment Information
The Company manages its operations
in three geographic segments for the purpose of assessing performance and making operating decisions including North America (including
its subsidiaries in United States and Canada), Latin America (including subsidiaries in Mexico and Ecuador) and Asia (including its subsidiaries
in Malaysia and Taiwan).
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year data
to conform to the current year’s presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on reported income or losses.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In July 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
("ASU") 2023-03, Presentation of Financial Statement (Topic 205), Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income
(Topic 220), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505), and Compensation - Stock Compensation
(Topic 718), to amend various SEC paragraphs in the ASC to reflect the issuance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 120, among other
things. The ASU does not provide any new guidance so there is no transition or effective date associated with it. The Company is currently
assessing the impact of adopting ASU 2023-03 on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2023, FASB issued ASU
2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands annual and interim disclosure
requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective
for the Company’s annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption
permitted.
In December 2023, the FASB issued
ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures to expand the disclosure requirements for income
taxes, specifically relating to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company’s annual
periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects
that ASU 2023-07 and ASU 2023-09 will have on the consolidated financial statement disclosures.
F-11
Net Loss per Common Share, basic and diluted
Basic net loss per share is computed
by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
loss per share includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and warrants, using various methods such as the treasury
stock or modified treasury stock method in the determination of dilutive shares outstanding during each reporting period.
For the years ended December
31, 2024 and 2023, the dilutive effect of 15,198,206
and 3,010,875,
respectively, of common stock warrants have not been included in the average shares outstanding for the calculation of net loss per share
as the effect would be anti-dilutive as a result of the Company’s net losses in these periods.
Fair Value Measurements
As defined in ASC 820 Fair Value
Measurements, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based
on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).
The Company determines the level
in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement falls in its entirety, based on the lowest level input that is significant
to the fair value measurement in its entirety. In determining the appropriate levels, the Company performs an analysis of the assets and
liabilities at each reporting period end.
The Company’s financial instruments
consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued interest, notes payable and, convertible debentures. The carrying amounts
of these financial instruments are of approximate fair value due to either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing
rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements. The Company’s derivative liabilities are valued using option pricing
models with Level 3 inputs.
Sequencing
Based upon ASC 815-15-25 Embedded
Derivatives, the Company has adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 Contracts in Entity's Own Equity
to its outstanding convertible notes and warrants. Pursuant to the sequencing approach, the Company evaluates its contracts based
upon the earliest issuance date.

Note 4 – Business Combinations, Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Original Acquisition
On May 7, 2018, the Company purchased
the assets of Stemtech International, Inc. (the “Former Parent Company”), out of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy for $400,000 and purchase
of a $4,000,000 note acquiring 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Canada, Mexico, Stemtech Mexico, Stemtech New Zealand,
Taiwan, Korea and Ecuador; and Stemtech Malaysia Holdings that owns two-thirds of its subsidiary Malaysia. In addition to the net tangible
assets, the Company acquired various intangible assets including patent products, licenses and trademarks and customers and distribution
lists. The estimated useful lives of the identifiable intangible assets range from six to fourteen years.
The excess purchase price has been
recorded as goodwill in the amount of $467,409 at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The estimated useful life of the identifiable intangible
assets is six to fourteen years.
LFR Acquisition
In March 2023, the Company acquired
100% of LFR, a research and development company with expertise in the formulation of products.
The consideration paid was 2.4
million shares of the Company with a fair value of $271,920. At the time of purchase, LFR’s liabilities exceeded its assets by $15,205,
and the difference between the net tangible assets and the purchase price, being $287,125, was allocated to a non-compete agreement and
will be amortized over 18 months.

On May 1, 2023, the Company amended
its convertible promissory note with Sharing Services Global Corporation (“SHRG”), which is eventually assigned to American
Pacific Bank - DSS wherein SHRG capitalized $222,556 of accrued interest and waived its conversion rights as per the original agreement,
see below. The promissory note is no longer convertible and is included in the chart above with plain notes payable. As of December 31,
2024 and 2023, the outstanding balance for the notes amounted to $1,349,915 and $1,278,325 respectively.
On October 24, 2023 and November
20, 2023, the Company entered into two notes with an investor for an aggregate principal balance of $450,000. The notes mature in March
2025 and accrue interest at 12% per annum. There was $59,323 of accrued interest for these notes recorded in accounts payable and accrued
expenses on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the outstanding balance for the notes amounted
to $450,000 and $450,000 respectively.
During the
fiscal year concluding on December 31, 2021, the Company issued a cumulative total of $2,423,738 in convertible promissory notes to investors.
These notes featured varying maturity dates spanning from nine months to three years, coupled with interest rates ranging from 8% to 12%
per annum. In addition, the Company distributed 154,173 shares of common stock and granted warrants allowing the purchase of 2,400,000
common stock shares at exercise prices spanning between $2.685 and $3.00 per share. The recorded value of both the common stock and warrants
was attributed as a discount to the notes, valued at fair market value.
In the second quarter of 2022,
one of the notes held by investor MCUS LLC (“MCUS”) was extended by 60 days, until August 1, 2022. As part of the extension
agreement, the Company issued 100,000 shares of common stock to the noteholder. Moreover, the conversion price of the note was reduced
to the lower of (i) 50% of the lowest volume weighted average prices for common stock over the 30 trading days leading up to the conversion
notice date and (ii) the Closing Price on the Closing Date, capped at $2.25. On August 18, 2022, this note was extended to September 30,
2022, in exchange for 200,000 shares of common stock and in the fourth quarter of 2022, this note was once again extended, this time until
May 31, 2023.
F-15
On July 13, 2022, another note
held by investor Leonite Fund 1, LP (”Leonite”), was extended to September 1, 2022, in exchange for 183,780 warrants, 75,512
common stock shares, and an increased principal amount of $70,833. The Company recognized $955,658 loss on extinguishment of this note.
On September 8, 2022, the same note was further extended to May 26, 2023, accompanied by a rise in the interest rate from 10% to 18% per
annum. The amendment of this note resulted in a recognized loss on extinguishment amounting to $252,429 (see Note 9 for other gain (loss)
amounts on extinguishment in 2022).
Throughout the third and fourth
quarters of 2022, the Company issued a collective sum of $400,000 in convertible notes payable, net of discount, in several installments
to MCUS and Leonite. These notes accrued interest varying from 10% to prime plus 8% per annum and possessed maturity dates nine months
from their issuance. Additionally, the lenders received 95,115 warrants with an exercise price equivalent to the lower of $2.685 or 65%
of the lowest traded price over the preceding 30 days, and 81,760 warrants with an exercise price equal to the lower of $2.685 or 50%
of the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) over the preceding 30 days. All the warrants issued were set to expire five
years after their issuance date.
In January 2023, the Company
issued 5,266,763 upon the conversion of $263,000 in notes payable. Upon conversion and settlement of the derivative liability, the Company
recognized a $318,678 gain on extinguishment.
On February 28, 2023, the Company
entered into a comprehensive settlement and exchange agreement concerning a Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note with Leonite. Under
this agreement, Leonite agreed to settle its outstanding liability and cancel its warrants in exchange for 10,648,152 common stock shares
of the Company to purchase common stock at $0.05 per share. As the debt was settled, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment worth
$132,142 and owed $637,684 worth of common shares. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company issued 6,340,591 common shares, leaving
a payable balance of 4,307,561 shares of common stock valued at $573,336, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on
the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023. On September 21, 2023, the Company issued the remaining 4,307,561 shares of common
stock.
On March 27, 2023, the Company
executed an investment agreement with an institutional investor (“Holder”) for up to $7,000,000 through a convertible promissory
note, share purchase agreement, and warrant agreement (the "2023 Note"). The 2023 Note, with a principal amount reaching up
to $7,000,000, carried an original issue discount of 12% and was structured to be disbursed in four installments. These installments included
a first disbursement of $1,000,000 on March 27, 2023, a second disbursement of $200,000 within three days after filing an S-1 registration
statement, a third disbursement of $500,000 forty-five days after the effectiveness of the S-1 registration statement, and a fourth disbursement
of $120,000 forty-five days after the third disbursement. The S-1 Registration Statement was filed on May 9, 2023. The 2023 Note bore
an interest rate of seven percent (7%) per annum and could be redeemed by the Company at any time for an amount equivalent to one hundred
twenty-five percent (125%) of the outstanding principal and interest on the Note. Additional disbursements were discretionary on the Holder's
part and could be executed at any time. Should the Holder's broker decline custody of the issued securities, the Holder would have no
obligation to adhere to the disbursement schedule, yet the option to make such disbursement would remain.
On April 11, 2023, the Company
amended its Promissory Note with MCUS, resulting in the conversion price being fixed at $0.05. Since the Promissory Note is not significantly
different after the amendment, the note was treated using modification accounting. After eliminating the bifurcated derivative liability,
the Company recorded a gain of $171,362 on settlement of derivative liabilities. On May 1, 2023, the Company partially settled its debt
with MCUS by agreeing to issue 7,739,938 shares of common stock, of which 5,121,200 were issued, resulting in a loss on extinguishment
of $79,212. The Company retains an obligation towards MCUS, entailing the issuance of 2,618,738 shares of common stock valued at $130,987,
which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses as of June 30, 2023. On August 11, 2023, the Company issued the remaining 2,559,600
shares of common stock.
Similarly, on May 1, 2023, the
Company amended its convertible promissory note with SHRG, wherein SHRG capitalized $222,556 of accrued interest and waived its conversion
rights as per the original agreement. However, this amendment was contingent upon the Company making a payment of $222,556 to SHRG, which
was duly fulfilled in May 2023. This amendment was treated using extinguishment accounting which eliminated the bifurcated derivative
liability and added additional debt discount resulted in a recorded gain of $557,793 on extinguishment (see Note 9 for other gain (loss)
amounts on extinguishment in 2023).
F-16
As of December 31, 2024, the
outstanding gross principal balance for the three convertible notes, net of discounts was $1,349,914, $0 and $0, and the remaining unamortized
debt discount for each note was $0, $0, and $0, respectively
As of December 31, 2023,
the outstanding gross principal balance for the three convertible notes, net of discounts was $1,369,182,
$227,778
and $0,
and the remaining unamortized debt discount for each note was $0,
$0,

respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding gross principal
balance for the three convertible notes was $1,400,000, $267,082, and $639,068, and the remaining unamortized debt discount for each note
was $1,259,825, $183,391, and $380,049, respectively.
The aggregate balance of convertible notes payable, net
of discount, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $1,769,583 and $1,596,960, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024, the company owed outstanding
principal balance of convertible promissory notes $106,009 and $25,000 to its Chief Operating officer and President Mr. John W Meyer and
Director Mr. Darryl V Green.
Note 7 – Derivative Liabilities
The Company issued debt instruments
that consist of the issuance of convertible notes with variable conversion provisions. The conversion terms of the convertible notes are
variable based on certain factors, such as the future price of the Company’s common stock, which gives rise to a derivative liability
which is a non-cash liability. The number of shares of common stock to be issued is based on the future price of the Company’s common
stock. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the promissory note is indeterminate. Pursuant to ASC Subtopic
815-15 Embedded Derivatives (“ASC 815-15”), the fair values of the variable conversion options and warrants and shares
to be issued were recorded as derivative liabilities on the issuance date and revalued at each reporting period. Based upon ASC 840-15-25,
the Company has adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 to its outstanding convertible notes and warrants.
Pursuant to the sequencing approach, the Company evaluates its contracts based upon the earliest issuance date.
As of December 31, 2024
and December 31, 2023, the Company had no derivative liabilities outstanding.
Note 8 – Financing Arrangement
- Factoring Liability
During the year ended December
31, 2024, the Company entered into various non-recourse agreements for the sale of future receipts for gross proceeds of $1,630,487, receiving
$947,101 in cash, which provided the Company with the ability to convert its account receivables into cash.
The Company accounts for these
agreements as a financing arrangement, with the purchase price recorded as a liability and daily repayments made are a reduction of the
liability. As of December 31, 2024, there was an outstanding balance of $673,611 compared to $143,944 as of December 31, 2023.

Note 11 – Segment and Geographic
Information
Operating segments are identified
as components of an enterprise about which separate discreet financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating
officer, or chief executive officer, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance.
The Company is operated and managed
geographically, and management evaluates performance and allocates the Company’s resources on a geographic basis. Operating segments’
measure of profitability is based on loss from operations. The accounting policies for the reportable operating segments are the same
as for the Company taken as a whole. The Company has three reportable operating segments: North America (including its subsidiaries in
United States and Canada), Latin America (including subsidiaries in Mexico and Ecuador) and Asia (including its subsidiaries in Malaysia
and Taiwan.).

Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies
Legal proceedings
On August
6, 2019, the former CEO (prior to the Company’s bankruptcy proceedings) filed a lawsuit against the Company’s subsidiary,
Stemtech HealthSciences Corp., alleging unpaid salary and vacation pay related to a period prior to the current management team assuming
control in 2018. The total claim is for approximately $267,000. The Company has filed a counterclaim against the former CEO and considers
his claims to be without merit.
As of December 31, 2024
and 2023, the Company has accrued $267,000 related
to this matter, which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Court dismissed
the former CEO’s request for summary judgment on March 3, 2023; however, the litigation remains ongoing.
Note 13 – Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for
under the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, future tax liabilities and assets are recognized
for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the amounts reported in the financial statement carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially
enacted income tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realized or the liability settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates
on future income tax liabilities and assets is recognized in income in the period that the change occurs. Future income tax assets are
recognized to the extent that they are considered more likely than not to be realized.
The FASB has issued ASC 740 clarifies
the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements. This standard requires a company
to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits
of the position.
If the more-likely-than-not threshold
is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements.
As a result of the implementation
of this standard, the Company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance with recognition and measurement standards
established by ASC 740 and concluded that the tax position of the Company has not met the more-likely-than-not threshold as of December
31, 2024.

an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of common stock to five directors in recognition of their services. Each director received 1,000,000

On March 7,
2025, the Company entered into a merchant cash advance agreement for a principal amount of $140,425. Under the terms of the agreement,

Item 9.
Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
None.
Item 9A(T). Controls and Procedures.
A.Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by paragraph (b) of
Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Stemtech’s principal executive officer and principal financial
officer evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) for the period
covered by this annual report as of its fiscal year end, December 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, this officer concluded that as of
the end of the period, these disclosure controls and procedures were adequate to ensure that the information required to be disclosed
by Stemtech in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated
and communicated to management, including Stemtech’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.
An evaluation was conducted under
the supervision and with the participation of management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that Stemtech’s disclosure controls and procedures
were adequate as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that Stemtech files or submits under
the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer
also confirmed that there was no change in Stemtech’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
B.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over Stemtech’s financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including
testing, using the criteria in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (“COSO”).
Stemtech’s system of internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Based on Stemtech’s evaluation,
its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Stemtech’s internal controls over financial reporting were
not effective as of December 31, 2024 and were subject to material weaknesses.
9
A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management
has identified the following material weaknesses in Stemtech’s internal control over financial reporting using the criteria established
in the COSO:
1.
Failing to have an audit committee or other independent committee that is independent of management to assess internal control
over financial reporting; and
2. Failing to have a director that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
3. Lack of segregation of duties consistent with control objectives.
4.
Insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and applications
of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.
Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
This annual report does not include
an attestation report of Stemtech’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Stemtech’s internal control over financial reporting was not subject to attestation by Stemtech’s independent registered public
accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit Stemtech to provide only management’s report in this annual report.
C.Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
During the year ended December 31, 2024,
Stemtech’s internal control over financial reporting was not subject to changes.
Item 9B. Other Information.
During the year ended December
31, 2024, no director or officer adopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as
each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
Insider Trading Policies and
Procedures
The Company has adopted
insider trading policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to promote compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations.
These policies apply to the Company’s directors, officers, employees, and the Company itself, and are intended to prevent trading
in the Company’s securities while in possession of material nonpublic information.
The policies include restrictions on trading
during blackout periods, pre-clearance requirements for certain individuals, and provisions related to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The
Company monitors compliance with these policies on an ongoing basis.
Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions
that Prevent Inspections
None.

13
(f) Nomination Procedure for Directors
Stemtech does not have a standing
nominating committee; recommendations for candidates to stand for election as directors are made by the board of directors. Stemtech has
not adopted a policy that permits shareholders to recommend candidates for election as directors or a process for shareholders to send
communications to the board of directors.
(g) Audit Committee Financial Expert
Stemtech has no financial expert.
Management believes the cost related to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Stemtech’s Board of Directors
has determined that it does not presently need an audit committee financial expert on the Board of Directors to carry out the duties of
the Audit Committee. Stemtech’s Board of Directors has determined that the cost of hiring a financial expert to act as a director
of Stemtech and to be a member of the Audit Committee or otherwise perform Audit Committee functions outweighs the benefits of having
a financial expert on the Audit Committee.
(h) Identification of Audit Committee
Stemtech does not have a separately
designated standing audit committee. Rather, Stemtech’s entire board of directors perform the required functions of an audit committee.
Currently, John W. Meyer our President and COO and Charles S. Arnold, our CEO are the only members of Stemtech’s audit committee,

Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters
The table below sets forth information
regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock by (i) our directors and named executive officers (including persons who served
as principal executive officer and principal financial officer during a portion of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024) and all the
named executives and directors as a group and (ii) any other person or group that to our knowledge beneficially owns more than five percent
of our outstanding shares of common stock.
The information contained in this table
is as of April 15, 2025. At that date, we had 142,443,444 shares of common stock outstanding.
A person is deemed to be a beneficial
owner of shares if he has the power to vote or dispose of the shares. This power can be exclusive or shared, direct or indirect. In addition,
a person is considered by SEC rules to beneficially own shares underlying options or warrants that are presently exercisable or that will
become exercisable within sixty (60) days.

Item 13. Certain Relationships
and Related Transactions. Director Independence
Stemtech’s board of directors
currently consists of John W. Meyer our President and COO, Charles S. Arnold, our CEO, John Thatch, Benjamin Kaplan and Darryl V. Green.
Pursuant to Item 407(a)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act, Stemtech’s board of directors has adopted the definition
of “independent director” as set forth in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASDAQ Manual. In summary, an “independent director”
means a person other than an executive officer or employee of Stemtech or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion
of Stemtech’s board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgement in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director, and includes any director who accepted any compensation from Stemtech in excess of $200,000 during any period of 12 consecutive
months with the three past fiscal years. Also, the ownership of Stemtech’s stock will not preclude a director from being independent.
In applying this definition, Stemtech’s
board of directors has determined that neither Messrs. Meyer nor Arnold qualifies as an “independent director” pursuant to
the same rule.
As of the date of the report, Stemtech
did not maintain a separately designated compensation or nominating committee.
Stemtech has also adopted this
definition for the independence of the members of its audit committee. John W. Meyer our President &COO and Charles S. Arnold, our
CEO are the sole members of Stemtech’s audit committee as a result of being the sole director. Stemtech’s board of directors
has determined that neither Messrs. Meyer nor Arnold qualifies “independent” for purposes of Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASDAQ
Manual, applicable to audit, compensation and nominating committee members, and is “independent” for purposes of Section 10A(m)(3)
of the Securities Exchange Act.
Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services.
Audit Fees
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the
aggregate fees billed by Bush & Associates, CPA were $47,500 and $60,000 respectively, plus any out-of-pocket costs.
We do not use Bush & Associates,
CPA for financial information system design and implementation. These services, which include designing or implementing a system that
aggregates source data underlying the consolidated financial statements or generates information that is significant to our consolidated
financial statements, are provided internally or by other service providers. We do not engage Bush & Associates CPA. to provide compliance
outsourcing services.
Effective May 6, 2003, the SEC
adopted rules which require that before Bush & Associates CPA. is engaged by us to render any auditing or permitted non-audit related
service, the engagement be:
·approved by our board of directors who are capable of analyzing and evaluating financial information; or
·entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the
board of directors, provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, the board of directors is informed
of each service, and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the board of directors’ responsibilities to management.
The board of directors pre-approves
all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors
either before or after the respective services were rendered.
