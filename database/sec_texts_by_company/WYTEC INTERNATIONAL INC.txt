EXPLANATORY NOTE
Wytec International, Inc. (the “Company”)
is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A (the “Amended 10-K”) to amend the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (the “Original 10-K”), originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) on March 31, 2025, solely to amend the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm included in “Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data” to add a conformed signature and to add a date to that Report, which were inadvertently
omitted from the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm in the Form 10-K.
In addition, pursuant to Rule 12b-15 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), currently dated certifications from the Company’s
principal executive officer and principal financial officer are filed herewith as exhibits to this Amended 10-K pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a)
or 15d-14(a) of the Exchange Act. Because no financial statements have been included in this Amended 10-K and this Amended 10-K does
not contain or amend any disclosure with respect to Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K, paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of the certifications
have been omitted. Similarly, because no financial statements have been included in this Amended 10-K, certifications pursuant to Section
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 have been omitted.
Except as described above, this Amended 10-K
does not amend, modify, or otherwise update any other information in the Original Form 10-K and does not reflect events occurring after
the filing of the Original Form 10-K. Accordingly, this Amended 10-K should be read in conjunction with the Original Form 10-K and the
Company’s other filings with the SEC.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Wytec International, Inc.
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We have
audited the accompanying balance sheets of Wytec International, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the
related statements of operations, stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial
statements (collectively, “the financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern
The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note B to the financial
statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and its total liabilities exceed its total assets. This raises
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters also are
described in Note B. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for
Opinion
These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we
are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits
included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

LLP
We have served as the Company's auditor since 2023.
