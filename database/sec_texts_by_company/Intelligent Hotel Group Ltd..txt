ITEM
1. BUSINESS
Overview
Intelligent
Hotel Group Ltd, formerly known as YCQH Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October
15, 2019. On May 6, 2025, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to change its name to Intelligent
Hotel Group Ltd (the “Name Change”), which was previously approved by the Board of Directors on April 15, 2025. To reflect
the Name Change, the Board approved a corresponding amendment to the Company’s bylaws on May 7, 2025.
The
Company originally operated in the bio-carbon-based fertilizer (“BCBF”) trading business, sourcing products directly from
producers in China and selling them to customers primarily located in the People’s Republic of China. The Company did not own or
operate any production facilities or manufacturing equipment for BCBF products. On July 25, 2022, the Company ventures into online retailing
business through e-commerce platform, retailing a series of daily use products covering from healthcare products, cosmetic products,
fashion products, household products and so forth. On April 19, 2023, the Company ventures into beauty products trading business which
includes retail sale to customer mainly based in People Republic of China, sourcing directly from producers in China.
As
of the date of this report, the Company has ceased all operations related to the BCBF, online retailing business, and beauty products
trading business. In light of this transition, the Company is actively evaluating potential acquisition targets and strategic business
opportunities in order to identify a new direction that aligns with its long-term growth objectives. The Company’s current strategy
is to reposition itself by identifying and acquiring or partnering with a target business that offers sustainable value and future expansion
potential.
Organizational
Structure
The
Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 15, 2019. On October 15, 2019, the Company issued 100,000 shares
of restricted common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to Ms. Wang Min, the Company’s founding officer and director, for a total
consideration of $10. Ms. Wang Min serves as our Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director. On November 28,
2019, the Company issued an additional 49,900,000 restricted common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to Ms. Wang for $4,990. On January
1, 2020, the Company issued a total of 40,000,000 restricted shares to ten non-U.S. shareholders (4,000,000 shares each) at a price of
$0.001 per share, raising an aggregate of $40,000 in working capital. In regards to all of the above transactions we claim an exemption
from registration afforded by Section 4a(2) and/or Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Regulation S”)
due to the fact that all sales of stock were made to non-U.S. persons (as defined under Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S),
pursuant to offshore transactions, and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of
their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing.
On
December 16, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of YCQH Holding Limited, herein referred as “YCQH Seychelles,” a company incorporated
in the Republic of Seychelles, from Ms. Wang Min, in consideration of $1. On the same day, YCQH Seychelles acquired YCQH Agricultural
Technology Co. Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, herein referred as the “YCQH HK,” from Ms. Wang Min in consideration
of HKD100 (equivalent to approximately $13).
On
December 10, 2019, YCQH HK incorporated YCWB Agricultural Technology Co. Limited, a wholly foreign owned enterprise, in SiChuan Province,
China, herein referred as “YCWB,” with Ms. Wang Min as the legal representative.
On
June 15, 2020, the Company, through subsidiary YCWB, acquired SCQC Agricultural Co. Limited., herein referred as “SCQC,” a
company incorporated in SiChuan Province, China for a consideration of CNY 1,169,996 (approximately $165,605) with a carrying value
on the book of CNY 1,168,554 (approximately $165,401) from a third party.
On
April 19, 2023, the Company, through subsidiary YCWB Agricultural Technology Co. Limited, incorporated XMYC Trading Co. Limited, a company
incorporated in XiaMen City, China with an investment capital of CNY 500,000 (approximately $68,931).
4
On
September 25, 2023, the Company, through subsidiary YCWB Agricultural Technology Co. Limited, disposed XMYC Trading Co. Limited, with a
consideration of CNY 0.1 (approximately $0.01). After the disposal of XMYC, the Company continued to operate the beauty products trading
business through YCWB for a period thereafter. As of the date of this report, the Company has ceased all activities in the
online retail and beauty trading sectors.
On
April 17, 2025, YCWB entered into a definitive equity transfer agreement (the “Disposal Agreement”) with Chenjiang Zhang,
an independent third party, pursuant to which YCWB agreed to sell all of its equity interest in SCQC. The Board of Directors of the Company
reviewed and approved the Disposal Agreement and the proposed transaction on April 17, 2025. On April 28, 2025, the Company completed
the disposition of SCQC. SCQC was previously engaged in business segments that the Company has determined
are no longer consistent with its long-term development strategy. The decision to dispose of SCQC was made as part of the Company’s
strategic plan to streamline operations and focus on other business activities.

As
of the date of this report, our corporate structure is as follows:
On
November 30, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Transfer Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Ms. Wang Min (the “Seller”),
the largest shareholder of the Company, and Ms. Yin Yixuan (the “Buyer”), a non-U.S. person. Pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement, the Seller agreed to sell, and the Buyer agreed to purchase, an aggregate of 47,000,000 shares of common stock (the “Shares”)
for a total purchase price of $1,094,400. No directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the Company, the Seller, or any
person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing. The Board of Directors approved the Agreement on November 25, 2024, and on the same
date, adopted resolutions appointing the Buyer as the Company’s Director and Chief Executive Officer, effective November 30, 2024.
In connection with updated terms and mutual agreement of the parties, the Company, the Seller, and the Buyer subsequently entered into
an Amendment to the Securities Transfer Agreement, dated June 24, 2025 (the “Amendment”). The Amendment modified certain
key terms of the Agreement, including but not limited to adjustments to the purchase price, the closing schedule, and the mechanics for
share transfer.
5
On
November 25, 2024, Ms. Wang notified the Board of her decision to resign, and the Board accepted her resignation.On November 30, 2024,
Ms. Wang Min resigned from all positions at the Company, including her roles as a director on the Board of Directors and as the Chief
Executive Officer. Ms. Yin Yixuan was appointed as a director and as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and therefore assumed control
of the Company’s management and governance as Director and CEO pursuant to the Board resolutions adopted in November 2024.
Our
Business
The
Company identified an opportunity in wholesaling and retailing high-quality, sustainable, and environmentally friendly BCBF. This fertilizer
was known for improving crop yield while supporting environmental sustainability. The BCBF was sourced from a third-party supplier and
produced through thermal decomposition of straw in a low-oxygen environment, a process that converts organic material into bio-carbon
at relatively low temperatures. The Company did not operate any production facilities or maintain any manufacturing equipment related
to BCBF.
Management
believed that the product helped maintain soil fertility, enhance crop yields, and improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient
efficiency. The BCBF also contributed to balancing carbon and nitrogen levels, neutralizing soil pH, and creating favorable conditions
for plant growth. The BCBF sold by the Company, produced through straw thermal decomposition, replaces the function of activated carbon.
The combination of soil and BCBF is capable of absorbing and reducing pollution content such as heavy metals from agricultural residual
wastes. Further, the combination of water and BCBF is capable of purifying water by producing carbohydrate and glucose, which could be
absorbed by, and is conducive to the growth of, plants. Additionally, BCBF possesses outstanding water storage capacity, which can store
up to 10 times the water content when compared to soil without BCBF, which in turn provides farmers greater flexibility during times
of hardship such as a drought. The BCBF sold by the Company contained approximately 45% organic matter, 20% bio-charcoal, 10% humic acid,
5% NPK, and an effective microorganism count of 20 million per gram. The BCBF products were distributed through the Company’s wholly
owned subsidiary, SCQC, which was later disposed in April 2025. As of the date of this report, the Company is no longer engaged in the BCBF trading business.
Bio-carbon-based-fertilizer,
BCBF
On
July 25, 2022, the Company expanded into the online retail business through an e-commerce platform, offering a range of consumer products
including healthcare, cosmetics, fashion, and household goods. During our operation of the online retail business in 2024, we purchased
goods directly from suppliers and then sold them to the users of the online retail platform, with the Company bearing the inventory risk
of the goods.
On
April 19, 2023, the Company ventures into beauty products trading business which includes retail sale to customer mainly based in People
Republic of China, sourcing directly from producers in China. On September 25, 2023, the Company through subsidiary YCWB disposed XMYC
Trading Co. Limited, with a consideration of CNY 0.1 (approximately $0.01). Despite the disposal of XMYC, the Company continued its beauty
products trading operations through YCWB until April 2025.

Recent
Developments
As
of the date of this report, the Company is no longer engaged in any of its previous business segments.
The
Company is actively formulating a diversified development strategy and plans to potentially enter multiple new industries such as hotel,
cinema, green energy, and automotive by the end of 2025. Currently, Ms. Yin has reached agreements of intent with GIORGIO MORANDI hotel
management company and several private cinema operators, exploring potential mergers or acquisitions opportunities. However, the Company
has not yet executed formal contracts or made final commitments to these agreements, and the relevant plans still require approval from
the board of directors. At the same time, Ms. Yin is also evaluating business opportunities in the green energy and automotive-related
fields, such as automotive lubricants and renewable energy fuels, but no agreements or binding commitments have been reached yet. Any
detailed plans or proposals arising from these explorations will be evaluated and approved by the Board.
The
transition away from our historical operations means we currently lack a stable revenue-generating business. As a result, we may require
substantial capital to support due diligence efforts, fund potential acquisitions, cover ongoing operating expenses, and establish the
infrastructure and personnel needed to launch or integrate new businesses. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - We may face challenges
in executing its business plan if it cannot secure adequate capital and may be compelled to incur high capital costs.”
Competition
The
competitive environment of China’s fertilizer industry is very tense despite its market size. The Company competes with other manufacturers,
distributors, wholesalers that possess significantly greater financial and non-financial resources, manufacturing capacity, well established
business models and distribution channels and branding.
The
online consumer goods and beauty products markets in China are intensely competitive and price-sensitive. For our online retail
business, our operations were conducted primarily as a third-party seller on established e-commerce platforms in the PRC that host
thousands of sellers offering similar products. As such, we faced significant competition not only from major national and
international brands, but also from numerous small and medium-sized merchants operating within the same ecosystem. In addition, our
position as a third-party seller limited our ability to differentiate our offerings, as we relied on the infrastructure, algorithms,
and policies of the underlying platforms for visibility, traffic, and transaction processing. As we sourced our products directly
from third-party manufacturers and did not maintain our own inventory or engage in private labeling, we were limited in our ability
to build a distinctive brand identity or customer base. Our competitors included both brand owners and large-scale distributors who
typically have greater control over supply chains, marketing budgets, product pricing, and brand development.
Employees
The
Company has 5 employees. Three of them work on a full-time basis. Additionally, the Company maintains mandatory social security for pensions,
medical, unemployment, work-related injury and maternity insurance. The Company segregates individual employees in accordance to function

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS
We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information
under this item. Despite the fact that we are not required to provide risk factors, we consider the following factors to be risks to
our continued growth and development:
We
may face challenges in executing its business plan if it cannot secure adequate capital and may be compelled to incur high capital costs.
Our
ability to successfully identify, acquire, and develop new business opportunities depends significantly on our access to sufficient capital.
As of the date of this report, we are no longer engaged in our previous business segments, including the wholesale and retail of BCBF,
online sales of consumer goods through e-commerce platforms, and trading of beauty products. We have exited these lines of business and
are actively evaluating new strategic directions, including potential acquisitions.
7
The
transition away from our historical operations means we currently lack a stable revenue-generating business. As a result, we may require
substantial capital to support due diligence efforts, fund potential acquisitions, cover ongoing operating expenses, and establish the
infrastructure and personnel needed to launch or integrate new businesses. Re-entering a product-driven or distribution-based business
would likely require investment in logistics, marketing, and supply chain relationships. Similarly, restarting or expanding an e-commerce
or consumer-facing business would necessitate upfront spending on technology, platform development, customer acquisition, and supplier
coordination. If we are unable to secure adequate financing on commercially reasonable terms, we may be forced to delay, modify, or abandon
elements of our business plan. In particular, insufficient capital could prevent us from completing acquisitions we are currently evaluating
or responding to time-sensitive opportunities.
Moreover,
if financing is only available at a high cost or with unfavorable terms, it could adversely impact our financial condition and strategic
flexibility. For example, raising capital through equity issuances may dilute the interests of our existing shareholders, while debt
financing could increase our leverage and financial risk.
Our
ability to obtain additional capital is subject to a number of uncertainties, including investor sentiment, market conditions, our financial
performance, and the perceived viability of our future business plans. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient
funding on acceptable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to pursue and implement our long-term
growth strategy.
Our
operational performance and financial results may be adversely impacted by prevailing global market and economic conditions, including
ongoing geopolitical instability in various regions.
Our
business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially affected by global economic and market conditions beyond our
control. Factors such as rising inflation, interest rate volatility, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, disruptions in global supply
chains, and labor market constraints can impact the availability and cost of capital, investor sentiment, and the valuation of potential
acquisition targets. In particular, continued geopolitical instability in regions such as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia
may lead to heightened market uncertainty, increased commodity and transportation costs, and shifts in regulatory or trade policies that
could disrupt business operations globally.
These
macroeconomic and geopolitical factors may also reduce the availability of viable business opportunities or affect the performance of
any business we acquire. Furthermore, investor risk appetite and access to funding may decline during periods of market stress, directly
impacting our ability to raise capital or execute our strategic plans. If such adverse conditions persist or worsen, our ability to identify,
finance, or operate new business ventures could be significantly impaired.

ITEM
1C. CYBERSECURITY
To
optimize our information security management system, we undertake periodic updates as deemed appropriate. We incorporate relevant standards
and frameworks to facilitate monitoring of compliance with regulatory, industry, and evolving data privacy requirements. Additionally,
we engage in ongoing monitoring of our IT systems and processes to promptly identify and address actual and potential threats. Our approach
includes regular adjustments to systems, procedures, and policies in response to identified threats and risks. This adaptive strategy
ensures our resilience against emerging security challenges.
Our
organizational prioritize on addressing cybersecurity risks, with management playing a central role in assessing and managing these risks.
Our internal processes mandate the escalation of significant cybersecurity risks to executive leadership, as well as to management and
committees responsible for preventing, detecting, mitigating, and remedying cybersecurity incidents. These processes ensure consistent
and effective incident handling and response, establishing standards for internal notifications and escalations. Moreover, they outline
considerations for external notifications, including disclosure or notification requirements to state and/or federal agencies or affected
customers in the event of a cybersecurity incident. This structured approach reinforces our commitment to robust cybersecurity governance
and risk management practices.
As
of December 31, 2024, the Company has not identified any cybersecurity threats, including previous incidents, that have materially impacted
our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. This assertion signifies our diligent efforts in managing and mitigating
cybersecurity risks, contributing to the stability and continuity of our operations.

ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
SCQC
was involved in a legal dispute with Sichuan Aima Ke’er Biotechnology Group Co. (“Sichuan Aima”) regarding a cooperative
agreement that was entered by both parties on June 7, 2022. This agreement was intended to support the business expansion of SCQC and
outlined mutual obligations for collaboration over a two-year period, set to expire on June 6, 2024. In January 2023, SCQC transferred
RMB1,000,000 (approximately $139,113) to Sichuan Aima as an advance payment for the cooperative arrangement under the agreement. However,
negotiations in March 2023 were unproductive, leading both parties to terminate the cooperation. Sichuan Aima provided partial compensation
to SCQC by offsetting the outstanding amount with goods of equivalent value at RMB466,637 (approximately $64,915). SCQC is now pursuing
the recovery of the remaining balance of RMB533,363 (approximately $74,198). On April 29, 2025, SCQC received a summons from the People’s
Court of Sichuan Pilot Free Trade Zone notifying SCQC to hold a court hearing on July 9, 2025, case number: (2025) Chuan 0193 Min Chu
6553. As of the date of this report, the case remains pending and no settlement has been reached.
In
April 2025, SCQC was disposed of and is no longer an indirect subsidiary of the Company. While the Company continues to monitor the dispute
due to its historical involvement, the outcome is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition
or results of operations.
Except
as disclosed above, as of the date hereof, we are not aware of any material pending legal proceedings to which we or any of our
subsidiaries are a party, or in which any of our property is the subject. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors,
executive officers, affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholders is an adverse party or has a material interest that is
adverse to our interests. From time to time, we may be subject to claims, legal actions, and regulatory proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business.

Penny
Stock Regulations
The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define “penny stock” to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition
of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000, or annual
incomes exceeding $200,000 individually, or $300,000, together with their spouse).
For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser’s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt
transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer’s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. Consequently, the “penny stock” rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock
and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market.
In
addition to the “penny stock” rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (“FINRA”) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must
have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the investors’
ability to buy and sell our stock.

Company
Overview
Intelligent
Hotel Group Ltd, formerly known as YCQH Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October
15, 2019. The Company operated in several business segments, including the wholesale and retail of BCBF, online sales of consumer goods,
and trading of beauty products.
Its
BCBF business was conducted through a wholly owned subsidiary, SCQC, and involved sourcing environmentally friendly fertilizer from third-party
suppliers. The product was manufactured using thermal decomposition of straw in a low-oxygen environment and promoted for its ability
to improve soil fertility, increase crop yield, and enhance water retention. The Company did not own or operate any production facilities
or equipment related to BCBF. SCQC was disposed of in April 2025, and the Company no longer engaged in this line of business since then.
11
On
July 25, 2022, the Company entered the online retail space by offering a range of consumer goods including healthcare, cosmetics, fashion,
and household products on third-party e-commerce platforms in the PRC. During our operation of the online retail business in 2024, we
purchased goods directly from suppliers and then sold them to the users of the online retail platform, with the Company bearing the inventory
risk of the goods.
On
April 19, 2023, the Company expanded into beauty product trading, focusing on retail sales to customers in the PRC with goods sourced
directly from local manufacturers. On September 25, 2023, the Company, through its subsidiary YCWB disposed of XMYC Trading Co., Limited,
which had been involved in the beauty trading business. Despite the disposal, the Company continued to operate the beauty product segment
through YCWB for a period thereafter. As of the date of this report, the Company has ceased all activities in the online retail and
beauty trading sectors.
Following
its exit from these historical business lines, the Company is actively exploring new strategic directions and evaluating acquisition
and investment opportunities across several industries. These efforts are intended to realign the Company’s operations with long-term
growth objectives.

Fiscal
Years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
The
Company generated total revenue of $246,466 for the year ended December 31, 2024, a significant decrease of 52% compared to $510,235
for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to the Company’s decision to shut down its online business since April 30, 2024. The total
revenue cost of the Company increased from $69,919 in 2023 to $149,984 in 2024, reflecting the rising cost burden of the online retail
business. The gross profit declined to $96,482 in 2024 from $440,316 in 2023, and overall gross margin decreased from 86% to 39%.
BCBF
Trading Business
Revenue
from the BCBF trading business decreased significantly from $57,803 in 2023 to $17 in 2024. The Company has continued to operate in this
business segment, but has not actively expanded the market.
Online
Retail Business
Revenue from the online retail business declined significantly
to $246,449 in 2024 from $384,234 in 2023, representing a 36% year-over-year decrease. The cost of revenue increased from $29,966 in 2023
to $149,978 in 2024, Among them, in 2024, there were inventory scrapping, inventory loss, and provision for inventory impairment, which increased the
cost by $82,923. Gross margin dropped from 92% in 2023 to 39% in
2024, reflecting reduced pricing power, increased platform fees, and supplier costs in a competitive e-commerce environment.
Beauty Products Trading Business
Revenue from the beauty products trading business
declined to $0 in 2024 from $68,198 in 2023, the Company withdrew from this market segment in April, 2024.
General and Administrative Expenses
The
general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $141,111 and $348,051 respectively, primarily
related to salary and social contribution, lease expenses, travelling expenses, advertising expenses, audit fees and consultancy
fees. Due to the reduction in personnel and rent, there has been a decrease in general and administrative expenses.
Selling
and Distribution Expenses
Selling
and distribution expenses were $2,452 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $85,418 for the prior year, reflecting a
significant year-over-year decrease of approximately 97%. These expenses were primarily associated with third-party storage fees
related to the Company’s online and beauty product sales. The substantial reduction in 2024 was due to the sharp decline in
sales activity and the discontinuation of inventory-handling operations as the Company moved away from its overall product
distribution activities.
Operating
Loss
As
a result of the significant drop in revenue and gross profit, partially offset by reductions in general and administrative expenses,
the Company recorded an operating loss of $47,081 for the year ended December 31, 2024. This compares to an operating income of
$6,847 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decline in operating performance primarily reflects the substantial contraction
across all former business segments and the resulting decrease in revenue-generating activities.

Foreign
Currency
Most
of our revenues and operating expenses are denominated in Renminbi. The Renminbi is currently freely convertible under the “current
account,” which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the “capital account,”
which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Under our current corporate structure, our company in the United States may rely
on dividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have.
Under
existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including payment of dividends, interest payments and trade
and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of the State Administration
of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. Our PRC subsidiaries may also retain foreign exchange
in its current account, subject to a ceiling approved by SAFE, to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. However,
we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC governmental authorities will not limit or eliminate our ability to purchase and retain foreign
currencies in the future.
Since
a significant amount of our future revenues will be denominated in Renminbi, the existing and any future restrictions on currency exchange
may limit our ability to utilize revenues generated in Renminbi to fund our business activities outside China, if any, or expenditures
denominated in foreign currencies.
Foreign
exchange transactions under the capital account are subject to limitations and require registration with or approval by the relevant
PRC governmental authorities. In particular, any transfer of funds from us to any of our PRC subsidiaries, either as a shareholder loan
or as an increase in registered capital, is subject to certain statutory limit requirements and registration or approval of the relevant
PRC governmental authorities, including the relevant administration of foreign exchange and/or the relevant examining and approval authority.
Our ability to use the U.S. dollar proceeds of the sale of our equity or debt to finance our business activities conducted through our
PRC subsidiaries will depend on our ability to obtain these governmental registrations or approvals. In addition, because of the regulatory
issues related to foreign currency loans to, and foreign investment in, domestic PRC enterprises, we may not be able to finance the operations
of our PRC subsidiaries by loans or capital contributions. We cannot assure you that we can obtain these governmental registrations or
approvals on a timely basis, if at all.
The
amount of cash denominated in RMB is approximately CNY209,092 (Equivalent to USD29,087) as of December 31, 2024.

Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to our stockholders as of December 31, 2024.

Critical
Accounting Policies
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company generates two streams of revenue.
The
first stream of revenue is generated through sale of goods, primarily BCBF and beauty products. Revenue is recognized when a customer
obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects
to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration
that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order
to determine this amount:
(i)
identification of the promised goods and services in the contract;
(ii)
determination of whether the promised goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context
of the contract;
(iii)
measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
(iv)
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
(v)
recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
The
Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Under Topic 606, the Company records revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. The Company
records revenue from the sale of product upon shipment or delivery of the products to the customer.
While
another revenue stream is our online retailing business. In online retailing business we have differentiate into two distinct revenue
streams: sales revenue with inventory risk and sales revenue without inventory risk. Initially, the Company act as an agent in transactions,
meaning we place orders with suppliers upon receiving orders from customers. The suppliers will then directly send the goods to the customer
based on our order info. A reporting entity assumes the role of agent in a transaction and arranges for the other party to provide the
specified goods or service. Consequently, product sales revenue is recorded net of cost of sales, as we act as an agent and do not bear
inventory risk.
We
purchased stock from several suppliers and outsourced inventory warehouse to a few suppliers. We bear the inventory risk, and therefore
we are the primary responsible party in this regard. Similar to previous operations, contracts are formed when customers place orders
in the app, and the performance obligation remains unchanged. Revenue recognition continues to be based on the point in time when customers
assume control and legal ownership of the purchased products, without deducting any associated costs, as this reflects the normal transactional
relationship between seller and buyer. We recognize revenue when customers take control and legal ownership of the purchased products.
15
From
the quarter four of 2023 onwards, the company continue operate as sales income from BCBF and online retailing business with and without
inventory risk. to fulfill such purposes. As such, revenue is being recognized on net basis, i.e. gross revenue received from customer
deduct the cost of purchase to supplier.
Besides, after adopting ASC 606-10-55-42, we offer our customers an option, allowing them to receive a 54% cash back
from the purchase of “Yao Cheng Duo” products in 2024, and a 44% cash back in 2023. Therefore, the 54% cash back in 2024 and
the 44% cash back in 2023 are substantive rights, and we offset the cash back portion against the revenue instead of recognizing the entire
purchase amount as revenue.
Going
Concern Uncertainties
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company
suffered a loss of $59,275 for the year ended December 31, 2024 resulting in accumulated deficit of $439,273 and a working capital
deficit of $281,771.
The
Company’s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company’s daily operations. While the Company believes
in the viability of its strategy and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to improve profitability and the ability to acquire funding through
public offering. If funding from public offering is insufficient, then the Company shall rely on the financial support from its controlling
shareholder.
These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the
date that financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not
being able to continue as a going concern.
Recent
accounting pronouncements
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging
– Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s
Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 aims to simplify the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number
of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. ASU 2020-06 also simplifies the derivative scope
exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity and amends the diluted earnings per
share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. Early adoption is permitted
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. For SEC filers, excluding smaller reporting companies, ASU 2020-06 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, ASU 2020-06
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods therein. The adoption of the new guidance,
effective January 1, 2024, did not have an impact on the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures of the
Company.
The
Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes will have
a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Restatement of Interim Financial Statements
The Company restated its previously issued unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements for the first, second, and third quarters of fiscal year 2024, primarily to correct the timing
of recognition of certain revenues, costs and expenses.
The Company reduced its operating profit before
income tax by $48,619 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and correspondingly increased it by $48,619 for the three months
ended June 30, 2024. The restatements had no impact on the Company’s consolidated full-year net income, financial
position, or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024. Please refer to Note. 14.

1.
ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND
Intelligent
Hotel Group Ltd, formerly known as YCQH Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October
15, 2019. On May 6, 2025, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to change its name to Intelligent
Hotel Group Ltd (the “Name Change”), which was previously approved by the Board of Directors on April 15, 2025. To reflect
the Name Change, the Board approved a corresponding amendment to the Company’s bylaws on May 7, 2025.
The
Company originally operated in the bio-carbon-based fertilizer (“BCBF”) trading business, sourcing products directly from
producers in China and selling them to customers primarily located in the People’s Republic of China. The Company did not own or
operate any production facilities or manufacturing equipment for BCBF products. On July 25, 2022, the Company ventures into online retailing
business through e-commerce platform, retailing a series of daily use products covering from healthcare products, cosmetic products,
fashion products, household products and so forth. On April 19, 2023, the Company ventures into beauty products trading business which
includes retail sale to customer mainly based in People Republic of China, sourcing directly from producers in China. As of the date
of this report, the Company has ceased all operations related to the BCBF, online retailing business, and beauty products trading business.
In light of this transition, the Company is actively evaluating potential acquisition targets and strategic business opportunities in
order to identify a new direction that aligns with its long-term growth objectives.
On
December 16, 2019, the Company acquired YCQH Holding Limited, a company incorporated in Republic of Seychelles. In the same day YCQH Seychelles

On
June 15, 2020, the Company, through subsidiary YCWB Agricultural Technology Co. Limited, acquired SCQC Agriculture Co. Limited, a company
incorporated in SiChuan Province, China for a consideration of CNY 1,169,996 (approximately $165,605) with carrying value on book of CNY
1,168,554 (approximately $165,401) from third party. The premium was accounted as expense for the year ended December 31, 2020.
On
April 19, 2023, the Company, through subsidiary YCWB Agricultural Technology Co. Limited, incorporated XMYC Trading Co. Limited, a company
incorporated in XiaMen City, China with an investment capital of CNY 500,000 (approximately $68,931).
On
September 25, 2023, the Company, through subsidiary YCWB Agricultural Technology Co. Limited, disposed XMYC Trading Co. Limited, with a
consideration of CNY 0.1 (approximately $0.01). After the disposal of XMYC, the Company continued to operate the beauty products trading
business through YCWB.
On
April 17, 2025, YCWB entered into a definitive equity transfer agreement (the “Disposal Agreement”) with Chenjiang Zhang,
an independent third party, pursuant to which YCWB agreed to sell all of its equity interest in SCQC. The Board of Directors of the Company
reviewed and approved the Disposal Agreement and the proposed transaction on April 17, 2025. On April 28, 2025, the Company completed
the disposition of SCQC. SCQC was previously engaged in business segments that the Company has determined
are no longer consistent with its long-term development strategy. The decision to dispose of SCQC was made as part of the Company’s
strategic plan to streamline operations and focus on core business activities.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities
and Exchanges Commission (“SEC”) and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“US GAAP”).
All material inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company has adopted December 31 as its
fiscal year end.
3.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use
of estimates
The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates
using the best information available at the time the estimates are made; however actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
F-9
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. Under
the PRC Foreign Exchange Control Regulations and Administration of Settlement, Sales and Payment of Foreign Exchange Regulations, the
Company is permitted to exchange Chinese Renminbi for foreign currencies through banks that are authorized to conduct foreign exchange
business.
Prepayment,
Deposits and Other Receivables
Prepayments
and deposits are mainly cash deposited or advance payments made to third parties for future purchases or future services such as rent
or other general expenses. This amount is refundable and bears no interest. The Company will recognize an allowance account for doubtful
accounts to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected. Management reviews its prepayments
and deposits on a regular basis to determine if the allowance is adequate and adjusts the allowance when necessary. The Company’s
management continues to evaluate the reasonableness of the allowance policy and update it if necessary. No allowance for doubtful accounts
was made for both years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Lease
The
Company adopted the ASU No. 2016-02, on October 15, 2019 (date of inception). The Company leases office space for fixed periods with
pre-emptive extension options. The Company recognizes lease payments for its short-term lease on a straight-line basis over the lease
term.
The
lease liability is initially and subsequently measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments
made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. Costs associated
with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease.
In
determining the present value of the unpaid lease payments, ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As most of the Company
leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease. The Company
adopted 4.75% as its incremental borrowing rate which is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar
terms and payments.
From
June 21, 2024, the management of the Company uses part of the leased office space of Chongqing Jiushengguang Enterprise Management Consulting
Co., LTD. free of charge. Please refer to Note 8 for the details of the lease.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company generates two streams of revenue.
The
first stream of revenue is generated through sale of goods, primarily Bio-Carbon-Based-Fertilizer (“BCBF”) and beauty products.
Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the
consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure
of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue
that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. The Company
applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount:
(i)
identification of the promised goods and services in the contract;
(ii)
determination of whether the promised goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context
of the contract;
(iii)
measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
(iv)
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
(v)
recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
F-10
The
Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Under Topic 606, the Company records revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. The Company
records revenue from the sale of product upon shipment or delivery of the products to the customer.
While
another revenue stream is our online retailing business. In online retailing business we have differentiate into two distinct revenue
streams: sales revenue with inventory risk and sales revenue without inventory risk. Initially, the Company act as an agent in transactions,
meaning we place orders with suppliers upon receiving orders from customers. The suppliers will then directly send the goods to the customer
based on our order info. A reporting entity assumes the role of agent in a transaction and arranges for the other party to provide the
specified goods or service. Consequently, product sales revenue is recorded net of cost of sales, as we act as an agent and do not bear
inventory risk.
We
purchased stock from several suppliers and outsourced inventory warehouse to a few suppliers. We bear the inventory risk, and
therefore we are the primary responsible party in this regard. Similar to previous operations, contracts are formed when customers
place orders in the app, and the performance obligation remains unchanged. Revenue recognition continues to be based on the point in
time when customers assume control and legal ownership of the purchased products, without deducting any associated costs, as this
reflects the normal transactional relationship between seller and buyer. We recognize revenue when customers take control and legal
ownership of the purchased products.
From
the quarter four of 2023 onwards, the company continued operate as sales income from BCBF and online retailing business with and
without inventory risk. Revenue of online retailing business without inventory risk is being recognized on net basis, i.e. gross revenue
received from customer deduct the cost of purchase to supplier.
In compliance with ASC 606-10-55-42, the company offered customers a 54% cash back incentive when purchasing "Yao
Cheng Duo" products, and a 44% cash back incentive in 2023. This substantial cash back is an important benefit for the customers.
Therefore, the revenue from these transactions is reported as the net amount after deducting the cash back, rather than recognizing the
entire purchase amount as revenue.
Deferred
revenue
The
Company’s accounting policy related to deferred revenue is to recognize revenue for performance obligations that have not yet
been fulfilled. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized amounts of $161
and $14,782 respectively. The
deferred revenue is expected to be recognized as revenue within 12 months from the reporting period, as all unsatisfied performance
obligations are expected to be completed within that timeframe.
Shipping,
Storage and Handling costs
Costs
for shipping, storage and handling activities, including those activities that occur subsequent to transfer of control to the customer,
are recorded as selling and distribution expense and are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues costs for shipping, storage and handling
activities that occur after control of the promised good has transferred to the customer.
Advertising
costs
The
Company’s accounting policy related to advertising costs for annual reporting purposes is to expense costs incurred in marketing
events for example event venue fees, emcee fees and others, as of the first date the advertisements take place. All marketing expenditures
are expensed in the annual period in which the expenditure is incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred
expenses in the amount of $0 for advertising and $10,851 respectively.
F-11
Earnings
Per Share
The
Company reports earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260 “Earnings Per Share”, which requires presentation of basic
and diluted earnings per share in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology used in computing such earnings per share. Basic
earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted into common stock. Further, if the number of common shares outstanding
increases as a result of a stock dividend or stock split or decreases as a result of a reverse stock split, the computations of a basic
and diluted earnings per share shall be adjusted retroactively for all periods presented to reflect that change in capital structure.
The
Company’s basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income available to holders by the weighted average number of
the Company’s ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the amount of net income available to each ordinary
share outstanding during the period plus the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities
had been issued.
Inventories
Inventories
consist of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in first-out method. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary
to make the sale. The Company reviews its inventories regularly for possible obsolete goods and establishes reserves when determined
necessary.
We
purchased stock from several suppliers and outsourced inventory warehouse to a few suppliers. We bear the inventory risk, and therefore
we are the primary responsible party in this regard. Our inventory is stored and managed at the facilities of third-party logistics providers.
These arrangements involve contractual agreements outlining the terms of storage, handling, and distribution of our inventory. Besides,
the third-party logistics providers are responsible for maintaining the quality and condition of the inventory in accordance with our
specifications.
Each
third-party logistics provider uses its own inventory management system to track the movement and availability of our products. They
will send us a copy of the movement and balance of inventory at the end of the month, which we then compare with the inventory movement
worksheet maintained by our company. This allows us to identify any inventory discrepancies promptly. The third-party logistics providers
facilitate the distribution of our inventory to our customers and fulfillment centers as per our instructions. Additionally, the logistics
providers are responsible for our inventory in any aspect of damaged goods due to their responsibility, for example, stolen inventory,
damaged goods due to warehouse conditions, and other factors.
Related
parties
Parties,
which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control
the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also
considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740 “Income Taxes”. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company
records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not
that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is
recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.
F-12
Foreign
Currency Translation
Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated
into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded
in the statements of operations.
The
reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (“US$”). The Company’s subsidiary in Seychelles, Hong Kong
and PRC which functional currencies are United States Dollars (“US$”), Hong Kong Dollars (“HK$”) and Chinese
Renminbi (“CNY¥”) respectively.
In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not the US$ are translated
into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “Translation of Financial Statement”, using the exchange rate on the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation
of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the
statement of stockholders’ equity.
Translation
of amounts from the local currencies of the Company into US$ has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective periods:

Fair
Value Measurement
Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement clarifies that the exchange
price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market in
which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability, that is, the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability. It also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and that market participant
assumptions include assumptions about risk and effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset.
This
ASC establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level
1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level
2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
full term of the asset or liability; and
Level
3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
by little or no market activity).
Recently
issued accounting pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income
Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. Under this ASU, public entities must annually (1) disclose specific categories
in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect
of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the
applicable statutory income tax rate). This ASU’s amendments are effective for all entities
that are subject to Topic 740, Income Taxes, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The
Company does not expect the impact of the adoption of the guidance to be material on its financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income
Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) (“ASU 2024-03”). This update
requires entities to include more detailed information about the types of expenses, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation,
depreciation, amortization, and depletion, in commonly presented expense captions such as cost of sales, research and development, and
selling, general and administrative expenses. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, with early
adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the impact of the adoption of the guidance to be material on its financial statements.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment
Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which focuses on improving reportable segment disclosure
requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. A public entity shall disclose for each reportable
segment the significant expense categories and amounts that are regularly provided to the CODM and included in reported segment profit
or loss. ASU 2023- 07 also requires public entities to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit
or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Entities are permitted to disclose more than one measure of a segment’s
profit or loss if such measures are used by the CODM to allocate resources and assess performance, as long as at least one of those measures
is determined in a way that is most consistent with the measurement principles used to measure the corresponding amounts in the consolidated
financial statements. ASU 2023-07 is applied retrospectively to all periods presented in financial statements, unless it is impracticable.
The Company adopted this standard in 2024 for annual period disclosures. See Note 13 “Segment Reporting” in the accompanying
notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.
The
Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes will have
a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
F-13
Economic
and political risks
Substantially
all the Company’s services are conducted in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), of which operations in the
PRC are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in rest of the world. These include
risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company’s
results may be adversely affected by changes in the political conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect
to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion, remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation.
4.
GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company
incurred a net loss of $59,275 for
the year ended December 31, 2024 resulting in accumulated deficit of $439,273 and
a working capital deficit of $281,771.
The
Company’s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company’s daily operations. While the Company believes
in the viability of its strategy and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to improve profitability. If the Company unable to improve profitability,
then the Company shall rely on the financial support from its controlling shareholder.
These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the
date that financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not
being able to continue as a going concern.

SCQC was involved in a legal dispute with Sichuan
Aima Ke’er Biotechnology Group Co. (“Sichuan Aima”) regarding a cooperative agreement that was entered by both parties
on June 7, 2022. This agreement was intended to support the business expansion of SCQC and outlined mutual obligations for collaboration
over a two-year period, set to expire on June 6, 2024. In January 2023, SCQC transferred RMB1,000,000 (approximately $139,113) to Sichuan
Aima as an advance payment for the cooperative arrangement under the agreement. However, negotiations in March 2023 were unproductive,
leading both parties to terminate the cooperation. Sichuan Aima provided partial compensation to SCQC by offsetting the outstanding amount
with goods of equivalent value at RMB466,637 (approximately $64,915). SCQC is now pursuing the recovery of the remaining balance of RMB533,363
(approximately $74,198). On April 29, 2025, SCQC received a summons from the People’s Court of Sichuan Pilot Free Trade Zone notifying
SCQC to hold a court hearing on July 9, 2025, case number: (2025) Chuan 0193 Min Chu 6553. As of the date of this report, the case remains
pending and no settlement has been reached.

Management
believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable in the future. Despite the Company
starting to turn a net profit for the year according to reporting figures, economic uncertainties dictate that the Company will only
adjust its valuation allowance policy if it can sustain net profits over consecutive reporting periods. Therefore, the Company has provided
for a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets of $94,012 as of December 31, 2024.

SEGMENT REPORTING
ASC
280, “Segment Reporting” establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with
the Company’s internal organization structure as well as information about services categories, business segments and major customers
in financial statements. The Company has three reportable segments based on business unit, bio-carbon-based fertilizer (“BCBF”)
trading business, online retailing business and beauty products trading business and two reportable segments based on country, United
States and China.
In
accordance with the “Segment Reporting” Topic of the ASC, the Company’s chief operating decision maker has been identified
as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing
performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements
to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers,
and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation
under “Segment Reporting” due to their similar customer base and similarities in economic characteristics; nature of products
and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive
officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based on the evaluation of these
disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting,
our chief executive officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The matters involving internal
controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board were:(1)lack of sufficient skillful and experienced accounting personnel to adequately prepare and review
its consolidated financial statements and disclosures to fulfill the reporting requirements;(2) lack of a functioning audit
committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of
directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;(3)
inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment;(4) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and
financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines;(5) lack of internal audit
function due to the fact that the Company lacks qualified resources to; and (6) perform the internal audit functions properly and
that the scope and effectiveness of the internal audit function are yet to be developed. The aforementioned material weaknesses were
identified by our chief executive officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of December 31,
2024.
Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management’s review and approval
of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that:
1.
pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
2.
provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management; and
3.
provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
17
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Management’s assessment
included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of
these controls.
As of December 31, 2024, management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established
in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”)
in 2013 and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that, during
the period covered by this Report, our internal control over financial reporting were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses.
Management’s
Remediation Initiatives
Since
2024, we engaged Shenzhen Pengcheng Financial Consulting Co., Ltd as an external consultant to assist with the identification and address
of complex and proper accounting issues.
In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we also plan to initiate
the following series of measures to further strengthen the Company’s internal controls going forward:
1.
hire
a reporting manager (“Internal Finance Manager”) who has the requisite relevant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience
and qualifications;
2.
make
an overall assessment on the current finance and accounting resources and hire additional accounting members with appropriate levels
of accounting knowledge and experience;
3.
streamline
our accounting department structure and enhance our staff’s U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements on a continuous basis
through internal training provided by the Internal Finance manager;
4.
participate
in trainings and seminars provided by professional services firms on a regular basis to gain knowledge on regular U.S. GAAP / SEC
reporting requirements updates; and
5.
engage
an external “Sarbanes-Oxley 404” consulting firm to help us implement Sarbanes-Oxley 404 internal controls compliance
together with the establishment of our internal audit function.
We
anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2025.

There
were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2024, that have materially

Independence
of Directors
We
are not required to have independent members on our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such
time as we are required to do so.
Code
of Ethics
We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and
determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal,
business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand
in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics.
Corporate
Governance
The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and in
other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations.
The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company’s employees, officers
and Directors as the Company is not required to do so.
In
lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company’s Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company’s financial
statements and other services provided by the Company’s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors, the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company review the Company’s internal accounting controls, practices and policies.
Committees
of the Board
Our
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our
Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Director(s) believe that it is not necessary to have
such committees, at this time, because the Director(s) can adequately perform the functions of such committees.
Audit
Committee Financial Expert
Our
Board of Directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert”
as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as “independent” as the term
is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14)
of the FINRA Rules.
We
believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and
procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because
management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that
retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an “audit committee financial expert” would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash
flows from operations to date.
Shareholder
Proposals
Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment.
A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

Compensation Philosophy
Our

the right to pay our executives or any future executives a salary, and/or issue them shares of common stock issued in consideration for
services rendered and/or to award incentive bonuses which are linked to our performance, as well as to the individual executive officer’s
performance. This package may also include long-term stock-based compensation to certain executives, which is intended to align the performance
of our executives with our long-term business strategies. Additionally, while our Board of Directors has not granted any performance
base stock options to date, the Board of Directors reserves the right to grant such options in the future, if the Board in its sole determination
believes such grants would be in the best interests of the Company.
Incentive
Bonus
The
Board of Directors may grant incentive bonuses to our executive officer and/or future executive officers in its sole discretion, if the
Board of Directors believes such bonuses are in the Company’s best interest, after analyzing our current business objectives and
growth, if any, and the amount of revenue we are able to generate each month, which revenue is a direct result of the actions and ability
of such executives.
Long-term,
Stock Based Compensation
In
order to attract, retain and motivate executive talent necessary to support the Company’s long-term business strategy we may award
our executives and any future executives with long-term, stock-based compensation in the future, at the sole discretion of our Board
of Directors, which we do not currently have any immediate plans to award.

Beneficial
ownership in the table above has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares
may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose
of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for
example, upon exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the
percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person
by reason of such acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table
does not necessarily reflect the person’s actual voting power at any particular date.

Review,
Approval and Ratification of Related Party Transactions

our small size and limited financial resources, we have not adopted formal policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification
of transactions, such as those described above, with our executive officer, Director and significant stockholders. We intend to establish
formal policies and procedures in the future, once we have sufficient resources and have appointed additional Directors, so that such
transactions will be subject to the review, approval or ratification of our Board of Directors, or an appropriate committee thereof.
On a moving forward basis, our Director(s) will continue to approve any related party transaction.
