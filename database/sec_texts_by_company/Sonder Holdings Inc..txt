BusinessOverviewWe are a leading global brand of premium, design-forward apartments and intimate boutique hotels serving the modern traveler. Launched in 2014, Sonder offers inspiring, thoughtfully designed accommodations and innovative, tech-enabled service combined into one seamless experience. Sonder properties are found in prime locations in 41 cities, spanning nine countries, and three continents. The Sonder app gives guests control over their stay. Complete with self-service features, simple check-in and 24/7 on-the-ground support, Sonder’s amenities and services are just a tap away, making a world of better stays open to all. We work directly with real estate owners to lease properties that meet our standards and furnish and decorate the properties to provide a design-led, technology-enabled experience, and then make them available for guests to book through direct channels, such as the Sonder app, our website, or our sales personnel, or through indirect channels, such as Airbnb, Inc. (“Airbnb”), Expedia Group, Inc. (“Expedia”), Booking Holdings Inc. (“Booking.com”), and other online travel agencies (“OTAs”). Additionally, in August 2024, we announced a strategic licensing agreement with Marriott and completed our full integration with Marriott’s digital channels and platform in the second quarter of 2025. As of June 2025, all Sonder properties are available for booking on Marriott's digital channels, including Marriott.com and the Marriott Bonvoy® mobile app, under the new “Sonder by Marriott Bonvoy” collection.Our design-focused accommodations come in a variety of shapes and sizes – from a multiple-bedroom apartment with a fully-equipped kitchen and private laundry facilities, to a hotel room or suite. Our diverse product portfolio serves various traveler types, including leisure travelers, families, digital nomads, and business travelers. We manage our properties using proprietary and third-party technologies and deliver services to guests via the Sonder app and 24/7 on-the-ground support. Guest ExperienceWe strive to deliver a better way to stay through technology and design and put the guest experience at the center of everything we do. We have reimagined the guest journey based on a belief that the ubiquity of mobile devices provides an opportunity to modernize the traveler’s entire stay. Our mobile-first experience, from check-in to check-out, is supported by the Sonder app, regardless of how a guest books their stay. All guests are encouraged to download and use the Sonder app to interact with our services and enhance their stay, but use of the Sonder app is not required.The Sonder app puts the “lobby on your phone” and empowers guests to seamlessly navigate their entire journey. This includes:•Check-In: Virtual check-in, online receipt of access instructions, and the ability to request a paid early check-in; •One-Touch Wi-Fi: In-app, one-touch connections to our speedy Wi-Fi;•Digital Concierge: Curated localized recommendations;•Customer Service On Demand: App-based service requests; and•Check-out: In-app requests for paid late check-out and information regarding on- and off-premises baggage storage.While our guest experience is primarily contactless and self-service, our guest services team can be reached 24/7 through the Sonder app, by telephone, text/WhatsApp, and email. For any requests requiring in-person support, we have local team members on the ground in each of our cities.We also bring a passion for design and creativity to our guests’ experiences. We take pride in the spaces we bring to life through our interdisciplinary teams and external partnerships spanning architecture, product and service design, graphic communications, and more. Our properties have been featured in publications including Apartment Therapy, Condé Nast Traveler, Forbes, Good Housekeeping, House Beautiful, National Geographic, Rolling Stone, and Travel + Leisure. Fully equipped kitchens, extra living space, and private laundry facilities are available in many of our apartment-style spaces, providing our guests a wide variety of options whether traveling for leisure or business, individually or as a group. 6Table of ContentsPropertiesAs of December 31, 2024, we had over 9,900 Live Units across 41 cities and nine countries, with over 800 additional Contracted Units. At December 31, 2024, our five largest cities (New York City, Dubai, Montreal, Miami, and London) accounted for 37% of our Live Units, and our 10 largest cities accounted for 60% of our Live Units. Our properties include 1-, 2-, and 3+ bedroom and studio furnished apartments, nearly all of which include in-unit laundry appliances and fully stocked kitchens, as well as thoughtfully designed studio and 1-bedroom hotel rooms. The majority of our Total Portfolio (as defined in Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) consists of commercial or mixed use apartment developments ranging from small 10 or 20 unit buildings to modern 300+ unit towers. Over the past several years, we have gone from leasing portions of buildings to primarily focusing on leasing full buildings. A smaller, but growing, proportion of our Total Portfolio consists of hotels, where we have partnered with independent hotel owners to convert existing properties into Sonder-branded hotels, putting a modern spin on the traditional hotel, with inspiring design and tech-enabled service.Portfolio Optimization ProgramIn November 2023, we implemented a portfolio optimization program to mitigate losses related to certain underperforming properties and to assess the Company’s portfolio of rents relative to current operations and existing market rents. As of December 31, 2024, we have signed agreements to exit or reduce rent for approximately 110 buildings, or 4,500 units, as part of our portfolio optimization program. Of the approximately 85 buildings, or 3,300 units, with finalized exit agreements, we had exited approximately 80 buildings, or 3,200 units, as of December 31, 2024. As of June 30, 2025, all 85 buildings, or 3,300 units with finalized exit agreements were exited.Marriott AgreementIn August 2024, we entered into the Marriott Agreement and completed the full Marriott integration in the second quarter of 2025. As of June 2025, all Sonder properties are available for booking on Marriott’s digital channels and platform, including Marriott.com and the Marriott Bonvoy® mobile app, under the new “Sonder by Marriott Bonvoy” collection. Our properties will also continue participating in the Marriott Bonvoy® travel platform. We expect to benefit from revenue opportunities and operating efficiencies through access to Marriott’s global sales organization and third-party agreements.Demand Generation We generate a majority of our demand by listing our units on internet-based accommodation marketplaces and on websites operated by OTAs. OTAs are paid a percentage channel fee for each Sonder stay booked on their platform. The primary OTAs that travelers have historically used to book our units are Airbnb, Booking.com and Expedia, with 50.4% and 49.4% of revenue coming through these three OTAs in 2024 and 2023, respectively.We also generate a substantial percentage of revenue directly through Sonder.com, the Sonder app, or our sales personnel. Direct bookings accounted for approximately 45.8% and 47.0% of total revenue in 2024 and 2023, respectively. We derive direct bookings from performance marketing, repeat bookings, and other organic traffic on Sonder.com. In the last few years, we have also developed a sales team to focus on corporate and group travel. These are typically significant revenue sources for urban hotels, but have not been a significant revenue source for us historically. Since October 2024, we also sourced a nominal amount of direct demand from the Marriott Bonvoy® travel platform, where Sonder properties were featured with links to Sonder.com for booking stays. Revenue earned through this method is captured in the total direct revenue in 2024.
Our revenue management team uses analytics and data science to optimize pricing and occupancy levels. This includes software that enables our revenue managers to set pricing strategies on a market-by-market basis, taking into account the anticipated response of Occupancy Rates to pricing changes. We have built pricing automation technology and a room attribution algorithm, which we use to create competitive and dynamic prices.Seasonality
Seasonality causes period-to-period variances in a particular property’s operating metrics, such as occupancy and pricing, depending upon seasonal factors, including but not limited to, weather patterns, local events, holidays, and property location and type. Our RevPAR, and thus total company Adjusted FCF, tend to be lower across our portfolio in the first 7Table of Contentsquarter and fourth quarters of each year due to seasonal factors such as weather and holidays and the market mix and product mix of our portfolio at the time. However, the effect of seasonality will vary as our market mix and product mix continues to evolve. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information.Leases and Transaction Process
We lease all of our properties, with a majority of our leases representing fixed leases, whereby we agree to a fixed periodic fee per unit that may be subject to negotiated rent escalations. We also offer flexible contract structures, including mixed lease structures, whereby we agree to pay the real estate owner a minimum fixed periodic fee, plus a certain share of property revenue, at times with a capped periodic amount, as well as revenue share agreements, whereby we agree to pay the real estate owner a variable fee based on revenue related metrics as specified in the agreement, rather than a fixed periodic fee.The majority of our property leases have 4- to 7-year initial terms, with up to two 5-year renewals at our option. Our leases commonly include an upfront rent abatement to offset the initial setup costs and revenue ramp for new units. They also frequently include downside protections, including partial rent relief in the event of a recession, regulatory changes, and force majeure events.Additionally, many of our leases have an upfront allowance paid by the real estate owner to help offset the capital invested to prepare and furnish the individual units and build common spaces. We are able to negotiate these allowances by offering real estate owners a higher expected yield on their investment, through future lease payments, compared to a deal without an allowance.Operations Our operations teams focus on servicing our guests, opening new Sonder locations, and providing best practice playbooks for ongoing operations. Our day-to-day operations are delivered by central and locally based teams, powered by a combination of proprietary and third-party software to address guest inquiries, issues, and requests quickly and effectively. Back-of-house teams such as housekeeping - both Sonder-employed and third-party providers - use software to deliver clean spaces and resolve any guest issues or requests that might arise. Our highly experienced on-the-ground openings teams focus on onboarding new properties quickly and efficiently, ensuring that the spaces are immaculately set up and well-photographed.Competition There is intense competition in all areas of the hospitality industry. Given the nature of our business model, we operate in two highly competitive environments: (i) attracting guests and (ii) securing desirable real estate supply. Competition for Guests Travelers have many options as they search for a stay that best suits their needs. We compete for guests based on many factors, including the location and quality of accommodations, property amenities, pricing, and brand loyalty. Within traditional hospitality, we have historically competed primarily with major incumbent operators in the upscale and upper upscale hotel segments. We also compete against boutique hotel operators and smaller hotel chains, particularly in non-U.S. markets. Within alternative accommodations, we compete with a wide variety of operators, many of which focus on a small number of markets. The alternative accommodation space also includes OTAs such as Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com, and other marketplaces, and various large internet-based companies that advertise vacation homes, home-shares, hotel rooms, and other travel services. While OTAs market and list competitors’ accommodations, they are also important channel partners for us. 8Table of ContentsCompetition for Real Estate Supply We compete against various parties to lease potential new properties. For our apartment-style properties, we compete against other leasing styles (e.g., traditional leases with up to 12-month term tenants) as well as other short-term rental companies with similar business models to our own. For our hotel properties, we primarily compete against traditional hotel property managers. We believe that we offer a compelling value proposition to the developers and owners of apartments and hotels. We provide apartment developers potentially superior economics by eliminating lengthy lease-up periods, minimizing sales and marketing costs, simplifying rent collections from a single master lessee, and removing many daily operational burdens. For independent hotel owners, we offer a steady stream of income while taking the operational headaches off their hands and applying technology and design to improve the property’s performance.Regulatory Compliance Our strategy includes rigorous attention to regulatory compliance, as our operations are subject to regulations in the following principal areas and across a variety of jurisdictions. Property and Accommodations Regulation Our business is subject to foreign and U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations that vary widely by city, country, and property type. In many cities, local regulations affect our ability to offer accommodations for specified durations or in certain neighborhoods. Hospitality and transient accommodations operations are also subject to compliance with laws, regulations, and standards relating to accessibility, zoning and land use, licensing, permitting and registrations, fire and life safety, environmental and other property condition matters, staffing and employee training, cleaning protocols, and property “star” ratings where required. Additionally, our real estate owners are responsible for their own compliance with laws, regulations, and standards, including with respect to their employees, property maintenance, operations, environmental laws, and other matters. Before signing any new leases in a new market, we engage local legal counsel to help identify relevant regulatory requirements. This research includes analysis on licensing and zoning, building code, accessibility and operations requirements, fire and life safety regulations, tax compliance, and local employment laws. Every leased property has unique characteristics, requiring further due diligence and regulatory analysis prior to entry into the lease agreement. Privacy and Data Protection RegulationIn the ordinary course of our business, we process personal or sensitive data, including information about guests and their stays. Accordingly, we are subject to numerous obligations related to our collecting, processing, and securing data, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy, security, and protection. Such obligations may include the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”) and variations and implementations of that regulation in the member states of the European Union, the United Kingdom (“UK”) General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) (collectively with the EU GDPR, the “GDPR”), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), as well as privacy, biometric, medical information, and data protection laws and regulations in various U.S. states and other jurisdictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively, with their implementing regulations, the “CCPA”). Employment Laws and Regulations We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees, including laws governing wages and hours, benefits, immigration, workplace safety and health, and hotel-specific ordinances. Securities, Accounting, and Nasdaq RegulationWe are subject to laws and regulations affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations, and corporate reporting, including the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), the rules and regulations of the SEC, and the listing standards of Nasdaq. Other Regulation 9Table of ContentsOur business is subject to various other laws and regulations, involving matters such as income tax and other taxes, consumer protection, online messaging, advertising, and marketing, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”) and other laws governing bribery and other corrupt business activities, and regulations aimed at preventing money laundering or prohibiting business activities with specified countries or persons. The regulatory environment in each market is often complex and evolving and can be subject to significant change. Some relevant laws and regulations are inconsistent and ambiguous and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Moreover, certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied to an innovative hospitality provider such as Sonder, which often makes their application to our business uncertain. For additional information regarding the laws and regulations that affect our business, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) We understand the importance of responsible business practices across the organization, including attention to ESG matters. Our ESG goal is to foster the social, environmental, and economic well-being of the communities we call home. Initial efforts include, among others, the publication of core corporate social responsibility policies, such as a Supplier Code of Conduct, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement, Modern Slavery Act Statement, and Zero Tolerance policy reflected in the “house rules” applicable to guest stays. We have also implemented a policy granting time-off to permit employees to engage in local U.S. elections, and a Volunteer Time Off Policy to facilitate employee volunteering. Employees and Culture Employees As of December 31, 2024, we had 704 employees in the United States (“U.S.”), and 717 employees located in 13 countries outside of the U.S. Our workforce consisted of 923 salaried and 498 hourly employees as of that date. Certain non-U.S. employees are currently represented by unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Culture Our people philosophy is to create a workplace where everyone can thrive. Our culture is defined by ten leadership principles, which are designed to ignite more innovation, encourage agility and strategic thinking, keep us inspired and coordinated, and be a better place to work. Hospitality“Extend hospitality to all” is one of our leadership principles. Living up to that principle means embracing different backgrounds and perspectives so that all of our employees, guests, partners, and communities feel safe, respected, included, cared for, and empowered. In accordance with our employment practices and non-discrimination and harassment policy, Sonder strives to create and maintain a work environment in which people are treated with dignity, decency, and respect, and is committed to providing a workplace free from discrimination, harassment, racism, sexism, intimidation, or violence of any kind. Intellectual Property We rely on trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets, contractual provisions, and restrictions on access and use to establish and protect our proprietary rights. At December 31, 2024, we had 102 trademark registrations and pending applications. This includes registrations for ‘Sonder’ in the United States, Canada and various other countries; applications and registrations for the Sonder bird logo in 27 countries; three registrations for ‘SONDER’ in China; and one application and one registration for ‘SANG DU in Chinese Characters’ in China.In addition to trademark protection, we reserve and register domain names when and where deemed appropriate and are the registered holder of 86 domain names, including “sonder.com.” 10Table of ContentsIn addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with certain of our employees, consultants, contractors, and business partners. Certain employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment agreements. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in the terms of use on our website and guest app. Corporate InformationWe were originally incorporated in Delaware on July 21, 2020 under the name “Gores Metropoulos II, Inc.” as a special purpose acquisition company, formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination with one or more target businesses. On January 22, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering. On January 18, 2022, we consummated a business combination with Sonder Operating Inc. f/k/a Sonder Holdings Inc. (“Legacy Sonder”), a privately held operating company (the “Business Combination”), and changed our name to Sonder Holdings Inc.Going Concern ConsiderationsIn accordance with ASC Topic 205-40, Going Concern, the Company’s management evaluates whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This evaluation includes considerations related to the Company’s forecasted liquidity and cash consumption requirements for one year from the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in Note 17, Subsequent Events, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has, throughout 2025, announced certain financing and investment arrangements. While the 2025 actions discussed in Note 17, Subsequent Events demonstrate a series of material steps taken to improve the Company’s financial condition, the Company has a history of net losses and negative operating cash flows and expects to continue to incur additional losses in the near future. Although the Company continues to pursue a strategy to realize improved operations, including anticipated improvements from integration with Marriott’s digital channels and platform through the Marriott Agreement, the timing of realization cannot be guaranteed to ensure liquidity is available when needed to meet the Company’s obligations. As a result of these considerations, the Company’s liquidity may be insufficient to meet its obligations for at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements, which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.Management’s plans to address the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, as described above, include the following actions:•engaging a financial advisor to assist in identifying and securing strategic alternatives and financing arrangements;•continuing to focus on identifying and executing cost optimization initiatives;•continuing to execute our portfolio optimization program to mitigate losses related to certain underperforming properties and to assess the Company’s portfolio of rents relative to current operations and existing market rents; and•improving its financial performance through the potential to increase revenue by integrating with Marriott’s commercial engine and deliver costs savings.There can be no assurances of the Company’s ability to realize these plans. As a result, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements.Available Information Our website is www.sonder.com.

Our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected, the market price of our common stock or other publicly traded securities could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in these risk factors, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The risks discussed below may not prove to be exhaustive and are based on certain assumptions made by us that later may prove to be incorrect or incomplete.Risk Factor SummaryBelow is a summary of the risk factors that could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, or cause the price of our publicly traded securities to decline.

unsuccessful in achieving positive and sustainable Adjusted FCF, and our restructuring initiatives, our portfolio optimization program, and any other cost-saving initiatives may not provide the expected benefits and may adversely affect our business.A primary focus is to put the business on a solid path to achieving sustainable positive Adjusted FCF as soon as possible (the “Cash Flow Positive Plan”) (as further described in Part II, Item 7). The Cash Flow Positive Plan has included a restructuring of operations, with a reduction in corporate and frontline headcount in June 2022, as well as further reductions in corporate headcount in 2023, 2024, and 2025. We have previously conducted staff furloughs and reductions, lease exits, and other cost-saving actions due to macroeconomic factors, and we may undertake other initiatives in the future to achieve and sustain positive Adjusted FCF. As part of our focus on cash flow, we have also undertaken a portfolio optimization program, which has involved, and is expected to continue to involve renegotiating the terms of our leases and the non-payment of rent primarily at certain underperforming properties. These efforts have resulted, and are expected to result, in the termination of certain leases, leading to exits of certain properties over time and the incurrence of expenses, including but not limited to impairment charges and contingent obligations, which could be material. The scope of the portfolio optimization program may change over time, and we cannot predict the number or product mix of the units that may be ultimately affected or the related impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The terms, scope, and timing of any additional changes to our lease obligations, as well as any other effects on our landlord relationships or reputation with future real estate owners and guests who are affected by property transitions, are uncertain. Additionally, in April 2025, we implemented approximately $50 million of annualized cost reductions enabled by our integration with Marriott. Our portfolio optimization program, and any past or future restructuring or cost-saving initiatives, may not achieve our goal of achieving positive Adjusted FCF, result in the cost savings we expect, or otherwise achieve our cash flow, profitability, or operational objectives. In addition, implementing any restructuring or cost-saving initiative, including the portfolio optimization program, presents potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions, revenue enhancements, or operational improvements. These risks include the potential for inadequate support of important business functions due to staffing changes and other cost reduction efforts, management distraction from ongoing business activities, potential failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing our plans, and damage to our reputation and brand image with real estate owners, potential guests, and others. Additionally, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity and accumulated knowledge, as well as adverse effects on employee morale, productivity, and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Employee attrition and difficulties in recruiting could, among other things, impair our ability to maintain and enhance our internal controls and procedures, complicate our efforts to pursue new RevPAR initiatives, execute effectively on engineering and technology development projects, cause inefficiencies, and make it more difficult to pursue, open, and operate new properties. Any of the above consequences could adversely impact our business, and we may not achieve positive Adjusted FCF when we anticipate, or at all.Our forecasts and projections are based upon assumptions, analyses, and estimates developed by our management. If these assumptions, analyses, or estimates prove to be incorrect or inaccurate, our actual results may differ materially from those forecasted or projected.Our forecasts and projections, including projected or anticipated revenues, margins, profitability, cash flows, Bookable Nights (as described in Part II, Item 7), RevPAR, Contracted Units, and Live Units, and our anticipated market opportunity, growth, and penetration, are subject to significant uncertainties and are based on assumptions, analyses, and estimates developed by our management, including with reference to third-party forecasts, any or all of which may prove to be incorrect or inaccurate. These include assumptions, analyses, and estimates about future pricing and Occupancy Rates; the anticipated cost savings, and other benefits of our Cash Flow Positive Plan; the anticipated benefits of the Marriott Agreement; and the scope and outcome of our portfolio optimization program, including the number and type of properties involved, the terms of lease amendments, the timing of lease terminations, and related expenses. Other assumptions include the type and size of future properties, the timing of lease signings, building openings, the satisfaction of conditions or contingencies in signed leases, local regulatory environments, the terms of future leases, and future costs, all of which are subject to a variety of business, regulatory, and competitive risks and uncertainties. If these assumptions, analyses, or estimates prove to be incorrect or inaccurate, we may have difficulties accurately budgeting for and managing our expenses, and our actual results may differ materially from those forecasted or projected.14Table of ContentsOur revenue, expenses, and operating results could be materially adversely affected by changes in travel, hospitality, and real estate markets, as well as general economic conditions such as an economic downturn or recession.Our business is particularly sensitive to trends in the travel, hospitality, and real estate markets, and trends in the general economy, which are unpredictable. Travel, including demand for accommodations, is highly dependent on discretionary spending levels. As a result, hospitality sales tend to decline during general economic downturns, recessions, and times of political or economic uncertainty, as consumers engage in less discretionary spending, are concerned about unemployment or inflation, have reduced access to credit, or experience other concerns or effects that reduce their ability or willingness to travel. Leisure travel in particular, which we believe accounts for a majority of our bookings, is dependent on discretionary consumer spending levels. Downturns in worldwide or regional economic conditions or inflationary pressures have in the past led to a general decrease in leisure travel and travel spending, and similar downturns or inflationary pressures in the future may materially adversely impact demand for our accommodations. Such a shift in consumer behavior could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.In addition to the impact of economic conditions, our business could be adversely affected by other factors that cause reductions in travel, such as:•Public health concerns or other public health crises;•Regional hostilities, war, terrorist attacks or civil unrest;•Immigration policies and other governmental restrictions on residency and travel;•Imposition of travel- or hospitality-related taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities;•Work stoppages or labor unrest at a potential travel destination; •Tariffs or international regulations; •Natural disasters or adverse weather conditions; or•Changes in regulations, policies, or conditions related to sustainability, including climate change, and the impact of climate change on seasonal destinations.In addition to affecting demand, economic downturns, rising interest rates, rising construction costs, and other adverse developments in real estate markets may result in decreases in new construction starts, property conversions and renovations, and increases in foreclosures, which could result in fewer units available for leasing. Any or all of these and other factors could reduce the demand for our services and the supply of new units, which could reduce our revenue. The above factors could also require higher marketing and other costs to attract guests, and could result in less favorable terms for new leases, which would increase our expenses.We may not realize the anticipated benefits from the Marriott Agreement and it may expose us to other risks and uncertainties.On August 19, 2024, we announced that we entered into the Marriott Agreement, pursuant to which our portfolio of properties is expected to join the Marriott system under a new collection called “Sonder by Marriott Bonvoy.” Although we currently anticipate that the Marriott Agreement will provide us with incremental revenue opportunities and operating efficiencies, we may not realize the anticipated benefits at the time, or to the degree we anticipate, or at all. The Marriott Agreement may not result in the revenue enhancements that we currently expect for various reasons, such as possible differences in the preferences and demographics of our and Marriott’s existing and future guests, potential competition among various Marriott brands for guest demand and attention, the uncertain impact on our revenues of integration with Marriott’s guest loyalty program, and other factors. While we have fully integrated with Marriott as of June 2025, we are completing certain engineering and process improvements relating to this integration. If these improvements take longer than anticipated, or if we face additional challenges post-integration, we may not realize the full benefits, including revenue, that we expect from our relationship with Marriott. In addition, the fees which we are required to pay Marriott may be higher than anticipated. We must also comply with specified Marriott standards and other conditions and requirements. Failure to successfully implement or comply with the Marriott Agreement could reduce the number of properties integrated into Marriott’s platforms; increase our costs; result in termination of the Marriott Agreement; adversely affect our brand, reputation, and relationships with property owners and other current or potential business partners; or have other adverse effects on us. The Marriott Agreement has an initial term of 20 years after the initial onboarding date, subject to possible extensions, and our rights to terminate the agreement are limited. In addition, the Marriott Agreement requires us to open new properties only if they are included under the Marriott Agreement, subject to limited exceptions. The potentially long-term nature of the Marriott relationship poses additional risks to our business and prospects. Particularly after we have integrated properties into Marriott’s systems and platforms, have invested in the integration process, and have realigned our 15Table of Contentstechnologies, staffing, and guest relationships and interactions, we may find it difficult to operate properties or build or maintain guest loyalty outside of the Marriott relationship in the future, even if permitted under the Marriott Agreement or after it has been terminated. Among other termination provisions, the Marriott Agreement may be terminated by Marriott or us upon any transfer of 50% or more of the ownership interests in or day-to-day management of our portfolio of properties or of our company, other than to a controlled affiliate, subject to the payment of certain fees. These provisions could make it more complicated to accomplish, or could deter, transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interests. Our relationship with Marriott may also make it more difficult to enter into a similar strategic relationship with a different hospitality industry partner in the future.We may be unable to successfully negotiate satisfactory leases or other arrangements to operate new properties, amend existing leases, onboard new properties in a timely manner, or renew existing properties on satisfactory terms or at all, any of which may limit our business and could cause us to miss our financial forecasts.We currently lease all of our locations. When we identify attractive locations for operations, we pursue additional units by signing new leases, or less frequently, adding units to existing leases. If we fail to secure or renew leases or other arrangements for properties, we will not be able to expand our portfolio of properties and may not achieve our financial forecasts.We may not be able to add sufficient properties to our portfolio that meet our brand standards, at an acceptable cost and on acceptable terms, to meet our strategic goals and financial forecasts. Due to the number of properties that we have already secured under leases or other arrangements in many major U.S. and Canadian cities, we may find it more difficult to find additional attractive properties in those markets. In Europe and other international markets, we have less experience and fewer real estate personnel, and local regulations and real estate industry practices may make it more difficult to locate properties that are strategically aligned with our business model. Increases in interest rates, inflation in construction and other costs, and concerns about a recession have caused and may in the future cause some property developers to delay or abandon development projects that we would otherwise seek to add to our portfolio. Even where we identify suitable properties, we may not be able to negotiate leases or other arrangements on commercially reasonable terms. Real estate owners may not accept our proposed terms, including due to our focus on signing agreements with lower capital expenditure obligations and quick payback timeframes. In addition, certain real estate owners may defer or forego discussions with us until they have more information about the impact of the Marriott Agreement and the potential implications for new leases that we may pursue. We may also have difficulties in providing real estate owners with acceptable letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits, and these difficulties may intensify due to any adverse developments affecting our letter of credit providers. Any such difficulties may result in higher cash outlays for lease security deposits, delays in signing leases as alternative sources of security are sought, or additional complications in signing leases in a timely manner. Certain real estate owners have been and may continue to be reluctant to enter into or continue transactions with us due to the decline in our stock price, our September 2023 reverse stock split to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price rule, the delay in our SEC reports resulting from our accounting restatement announced in March 2024, our portfolio optimization program and the resulting lease amendment, terminations, and property exits, potential concerns related to our ability to continue as a going concern, and related concerns of owners or their lenders about our creditworthiness, future cash position, or ability to raise capital.Competition for attractive properties can be intense, and competitors may offer owners and developers more attractive terms. We also have relatively little experience with alternatives to traditional leases, which may make it more difficult for us to secure properties where the owner or developer prefers a management agreement or other occupancy arrangement.Furthermore, our ability to extend an expiring lease on favorable terms will depend on then-prevailing conditions in the real estate market, such as overall rental cost increases, competition from other would-be tenants for desirable leased spaces, our relationships with current and prospective building landlords, real estate owners’ perceptions of our creditworthiness and prospects, and other potential factors that are not within our control. For example, in markets where the prevailing rents for apartments have been increasing, real estate owners may also believe that, compared to the terms that we offer, they can achieve a superior return through more traditional individual tenancies. If we are not able to renew an expiring lease, we have incurred losses and may in the future lose the opportunity to generate additional revenue from that space and have incurred costs and may in the future incur costs related to vacating it. If we renew a lease with higher than expected rent or on terms that are otherwise less favorable to us than expected, our profitability and cash flow could be adversely affected16Table of ContentsDelays in real estate development and construction projects related to our leases could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue, and newly leased properties may be more difficult or expensive to integrate into our operations than expected.Our business is also subject to property development risks. We often enter into arrangements with property developers to lease all or a portion of a building that is being built or converted for housing accommodations. Even where a project proceeds as planned, it can be many months or even years before the leased property is completed and Live Units become available for guest booking. In addition, the commitments of owners and developers under these arrangements are subject to various conditions and the completion of such development and construction projects are subject to numerous risks, including, the owner’s or developer’s ability to obtain adequate financing, costs of construction materials or labor, and governmental or regulatory approvals. Increases in interest rates and inflation in construction and other costs, have caused and may in the future cause some property owners and developers to have difficulty financing, refinancing, or completing projects for properties that we plan to lease. We have experienced unforeseen terminations of and delays in the readiness of property developments, and we expect to encounter similar events in the future. As a result, certain Contracted Units may not develop into new sources of revenue when we anticipated or at all.Even when we succeed in signing a lease for a new property, the owner or developer may be unable or unwilling to deliver the property in a timely manner or in the agreed condition, or we may encounter other unforeseen delays in preparing the property for initial guest bookings (a process we refer to “building opening”). Delays in building openings may occur due to supply chain shortages including fixtures, furnishings, and other materials, delays in governmental permits and approvals, delays in financing, labor shortages, or the unavailability of construction materials or contractors. Later or longer than expected building openings at properties also results in a delay in generating revenue from such properties, which could cause us to miss our financial forecasts or goals. In addition, the success of any new property will depend on our ability to integrate the property into existing operations and into Marriott’s programs and systems under the Marriott Agreement, which is subject to uncertainties including potential difficulties in integrating guest-facing and back-office systems or in engaging third-party vendors to service the properties. Newly leased properties could be more difficult or expensive to onboard, have undisclosed conditions that result in unanticipated expenses or claims against us for which we may have little or no effective recourse against the landlord, or otherwise may not provide their anticipated benefits.17Table of ContentsOur limited operating history and evolving business make it difficult to predict whether we will achieve our financial, operating, and growth forecasts.Our business continues to evolve. We have expanded significantly since our inception, including the number of cities and countries in which we operate. After initially focusing on apartment-style units, we now also operate hotel properties that have more extensive and complex amenities and systems. We have also focused our expansion efforts on leasing full buildings or larger numbers of units or floors within a property. In addition, we have operated some of our leased properties for a limited period of time, and their early results may not be indicative of their long-term performance. For example, a small portion of units available for guest bookings as of December 31, 2024, which we refer to as “Live Units”, had been live for less than one year. At hotels whose former operators have relied heavily on group and corporate bookings, we have experienced and may continue to experience longer than expected revenue ramp-up periods, and we expect to devote more resources to sales efforts at future hotels. Our relatively limited operating history and evolving business make it difficult to evaluate the likelihood that we will achieve our financial, operating, and growth forecasts, and to predict and plan for the risks and challenges we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability to:•Forecast our revenue and budget for and manage our expenses, particularly at new buildings or in new markets;•Onboard new, high-quality units in a timely and cost-effective manner;•The impact of the Marriott Agreement and potential exposure to related risks and uncertainties;•Keep Live Units available for booking and reduce nights lost to repairs or other interruptions;•Successfully implement new systems and processes;•Integrate Contracted Units and new signings into our and Marriott’s systems and processes;•Comply with existing and new laws and regulations applicable to our business;•Plan for and manage capital expenditures for current and future properties, such as the refreshment of units, and manage relationships with landlords, developers, service providers, and other partners;•Anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes, fluctuations in travel and tourism, and other changes in the markets in which we operate;•Maintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;•Effectively manage our operations;•Successfully expand our geographic reach; and•Hire, integrate, and retain talented people at all levels of our organization.If we fail to address these risks and challenges, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving industry, any predictions about future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in more predictable markets. If we do not address these risks successfully, or if our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which are used to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, our results of operations could differ materially from expectations and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.We have a history of net losses, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability or positive cash flow in the future.We have incurred net losses and negative cash flow each year since our inception, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability or positive cash flow in the future. We incurred substantial net losses over the past several years, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2024. We also had negative cash flow from operating activities of $129.2 million and $110.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These efforts may be more costly than expected and may not result in expected increases in revenue or growth in our business, which would impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability or positive cash flow. Our Cash Flow Positive Plan, our portfolio optimization program, and the Marriott Agreement may not provide the cash flow, revenue improvement, cost savings, or other benefits that we anticipate. In addition, we generally lease properties under multi-year arrangements, but guest revenues are generated through stays that currently average less than a week. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with the fixed components of our lease obligations, investments, and other expenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis or at all. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows would be adversely affected.18Table of ContentsWe depend on landlords for certain maintenance and other significant obligations related to our properties, and any failures in this area could hurt our business.We do not own any of our properties and manage and operate them under leases with third-party landlords. At some properties, our guest units comprise only a portion of the building and common areas and amenities are shared with other tenants or unit owners. We often have limited control over the common areas and amenities of buildings in which our units are located. In addition, we depend on our landlords to deliver properties in a suitable condition and to perform important ongoing maintenance, repair, and other activities with respect to common areas, amenities, and building systems such as plumbing, elevators, electrical, and fire and life safety. If our landlords do not fulfill their obligations or fail to maintain and operate their buildings appropriately, we could be subject to claims by guests and other parties, and our business, reputation, and guest relationships may suffer.Disputes and litigation relating to our leases and our portfolio optimization program have resulted in and could again result in significant losses, damage to landlord relationships, slower than expected expansion, and lower revenues.The nature of our rights and responsibilities under our leases may be subject to interpretation, and our leasing relationships will from time to time give rise to disagreements, which have included and may include disagreements over the timing and amount of capital investments or improvements, requests by us or our landlords to amend leases, rent obligations and abatement rights, operational and repair responsibilities, liability to third parties, a party’s right to terminate a lease, and reimbursement for certain renovations and costs. For example, we have experienced actual and threatened claims and legal proceedings initiated by property owners in connection with proposed lease amendments or terminations arising from our portfolio optimization program, and we may experience additional claims and proceedings.We seek to resolve any disagreements and develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential landlords, but we cannot always do so. Failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation in the past and could result in litigation in the future. Disputes may be expensive to litigate, even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor. We cannot predict the outcome of any litigation. An adverse judgment, settlement, or court order in a proceeding could cause significant expenses and constraints in our business operations and expansion plans. We are unable to predict the outcome of litigation or our ultimate responsibility for any adverse outcome. Even any litigation is resolved favorably, legal proceedings have required and may continue to require substantial management attention and significant legal fees and expenses.The long-term and fixed-cost nature of our leases may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.We currently lease all of our properties and are committed for the leases’ terms, generally without the right to early termination. Our obligations to landlords under these agreements extend for years, while we do not have a corresponding source of guaranteed revenue because guests typically stay for less than a week at our properties.Our leases generally provide for fixed monthly payments that are not tied to Occupancy Rates or revenues, and our leases typically contain minimum rental payment obligations. We sometimes offer landlords lower minimum payments in return for a share of the property’s revenues, or other variable terms, but those currently represent a small portion of our portfolio, and we may be unsuccessful in securing variable or participating lease terms. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sign and operate successfully under leases with revenue-sharing or other variable terms. As a result of our fixed lease expenses, if we are unable to maintain sufficient Occupancy Rates and pricing, our lease expenses may exceed our revenue. For example, in an environment where the prevailing cost of accommodations may be decreasing, we may not be able to lower our fixed monthly payments under our leases at rates commensurate with the rates at which we would be pressured to lower our guest rates, which may also reduce our margins and cash flow. In any such event, we may be unable to reduce our rent under the lease or otherwise terminate the lease in accordance with its terms.We have limited flexibility to rapidly alter our portfolio of properties and our lease commitments in response to changing circumstances. Leases require substantial time to negotiate and are typically multi-year commitments that can only be revised or terminated with the landlord’s agreement. In addition, some of our leases require the landlord’s consent to assign the lease or sublease the property, which may not be granted or may be granted only on unfavorable terms. Even if we are able to assign or sublease an unprofitable property, we may incur significant costs, including transaction costs associated with finding and negotiating with potential transferees, upfront payments or other inducements, costs to restore the property to its previous condition, and other costs to exit the property.19Table of ContentsOur leases have been and may in the future be subject to termination before their scheduled expiration, which could be disruptive and costly.Our leases have been and in the future may be subject to termination before they are scheduled to expire, including the bankruptcy of a developer or landlord, noncompliance with underlying covenants governing the property, or the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria. Certain of our leases have been terminated or may be subject to termination due to our portfolio optimization program. Some leases also contain conditions to the landlord’s or our obligations or permit the landlord to terminate before the scheduled expiration date, including due to any failure by us to provide a cash security deposit or an acceptable letter of credit, surety bond, or other security instrument. Some leases for Contracted Units have contingencies (including construction financing contingencies, zoning, permitting or other regulatory conditions, landlord purchase contingencies, or other contingencies that we or the landlord must satisfy) that must be satisfied prior to our takeover of the units. If these contingencies are not satisfied prior to our takeover of the units, the lease is terminable by us or the landlord. In addition, certain leases are terminable by the landlord for other reasons. Many of our leased properties have been pledged as collateral for mortgage loans entered into by the owners of the properties when those properties were purchased or refinanced. If those owners cannot repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all, such owners may declare bankruptcy and/or lenders could declare a default, accelerate the related debt, and foreclose on the subject property. In addition, some of our units are subleased from parties that lease the underlying property from its owner. If our landlord fails to comply with its underlying lease, or the lease is otherwise terminated earlier than expected, we could lose the right to continue to operate our units or could be forced to cure the landlord’s failure without being assured of recouping the related costs. From time to time, we have experienced the loss or disruption of leases for Contracted Units and Live Units for reasons such as those described above, and similar events may occur in the future. The termination of our leases due to any of the foregoing events would eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows from the affected property, which could have a significant negative effect on our results of operations and liquidity. Landlords or other business partners may also assert the right to terminate leases or other significant contracts even where the agreements do not provide such a right. If terminations occur for these or other reasons, we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims, which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses. Any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the revenues and income we would have otherwise generated from the property. Early terminations of significant agreements could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business.Our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations.We currently maintain properties in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, continental Europe, and the United Arab Emirates, and plan to continue our efforts to expand globally, including, eventually, in jurisdictions where we do not currently operate. Managing a global organization is challenging, time consuming, and expensive, and any international expansion efforts that we undertake may not be profitable or otherwise be successful. We have limited operating experience in many foreign jurisdictions and must continue to make significant investments to build our international operations. Conducting international operations subjects us to risks that we generally do not face in the United States. 20Table of ContentsThese risks include:•Costs, risks, and uncertainties associated with tailoring our services in international jurisdictions as needed to better address and balance both our needs, the needs of our guests, and threats of local competitors with compliance under applicable rules and regulations;•Uncertainties in forecasting revenues and expenses in markets where we have not previously operated;•Costs and risks associated with international, national, and local laws, regulations and policies governing topics such as zoning (hotels and other accommodations) and permits, accessibility, property development and rental, accessibility, health and safety, climate change and sustainability, privacy, and labor and employment;•Differences in local real estate and hotel industry practices, including leasing and hotel transaction terms, that may make it challenging for us to add properties on satisfactory terms or that may require higher than expected upfront payments, security deposits, repair and maintenance expenses, amenity expenses, or other costs;•Operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;•Costs and risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations, including laws governing tax, advertising and other Internet activities, email and other messaging, privacy and data security, intellectual property, and other activities important to our business;•Costs and risks associated with compliance with the FCPA and other laws in the United States related to conducting business outside the United States, as well as the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions governing bribery, anti-money laundering, and other corrupt business activities;•Costs and risks associated with human trafficking, modern slavery and forced labor reporting, training, and due diligence laws and regulations in various jurisdictions;•Additional exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates;•Competition with companies that understand the local market better than we do or that have preexisting relationships with landlords, property developers, regulators, and guests in those markets;•Reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and•Other events or factors, including political, social and macroeconomic factors, hostilities and war (including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and recent events in the Middle East), acts of terrorism or responses to these events.Entry into certain transactions with foreign entities now or in the future may be subject to government regulations, including review related to foreign direct investment by U.S. or foreign government entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity is subject to regulatory review, such regulatory review might limit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-term business strategy.Operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability and could instead result in increased costs without a corresponding benefit. We cannot guarantee that our international expansion efforts will be successful.21Table of ContentsIf we fail to attract new guests or generate repeat bookings from previous guests, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows would be materially adversely affected.Our success depends significantly on attracting new guests and securing repeat bookings from previous guests. Our ability to attract and retain guests could be materially and adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•The impact of events beyond our control on demand for travel and accommodations in our markets, a future health crisis, changes in government travel restrictions or policies, labor or civic unrest, war, travel-related incidents and weather;•Failure to meet guests’ expectations;•Increased competition from other hotel and alternative accommodation providers;•Failure to provide differentiated, high-quality experiences at competitive prices;•Guests not receiving timely and adequate customer/guest service support;•Failure to provide new or enhanced amenities and services that guests value;•Any disruptions in guests access to properties or to the properties’ amenities;•Ineffectiveness of marketing efforts;•Negative associations with, or failure to raise awareness of, our brand;•Negative perceptions of the safety of our properties, including due to the absence of front desks or other traditional, onsite hotel staffing at some properties;•Negative perceptions of the security of our app or website, including due to previous security incidents, or any other data security incident; and•Inflation, economic recessions, or other macroeconomic factors, and other conditions outside of our control affecting travel and the hospitality industry generally.In addition, we could fail to attract first-time guests or additional bookings from previous guests if our website and/or the Sonder app are not easy to navigate, guests have an unsatisfactory digital experience, the listings and other content provided on our website or the Sonder app and on third-party listing platforms are not displayed effectively to guests, or we fail to provide an experience that meets rapidly changing consumer preferences and travel needs. If we fail to attract new guests or generate repeat bookings due to these or other factors, our revenues would suffer, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.We offer different types of hospitality services than traditional hospitality operators and short-term rental marketplaces, and if guest and property owner acceptance of this innovative approach to accommodations does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than we expect, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.We offer a distinctive type of hospitality service for which the market is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at all, and particularly during times of market volatility, rising interest rates, and general economic instability. Our success will depend on the willingness of potential guests and the market at large to widely adopt our model of hospitality services, which differs from both traditional hotels and short-term rental marketplaces. In many geographies, including geographies that we hope to enter in the future, the market for our hospitality services is unproven, with little data or research available regarding the market and industry. If potential guests do not perceive our units’ designs, amenities, location, or pricing to be attractive, or choose different accommodations due to concerns regarding safety, the availability of onsite staffing, amenities or services associated with traditional hotels, affordability, or other reasons, then the market for our accommodations may not further develop, may develop more slowly than expected, or may not achieve its expected growth potential. Such outcomes could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.Our growth also depends on the acceptance of our innovative business model by landlords and property developers, and on our ability to operate in markets without clear or well-established regulations covering properties used in our business. For these and other reasons, we may make errors in predicting demand and the supply of potential units in certain markets, which could cause us to spend more in a certain market than is justified by the resulting revenues, or to miss our financial targets, and could otherwise harm our business.22Table of ContentsThe hospitality market is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully with current or future competitors.The hospitality market is highly competitive and fragmented. In addition, new competitors may enter the market at any time. Our current and potential competitors include global hotel brands, regional hotel chains, independent hotels, OTAs, and short-term rental services. Numerous vacation, hotel, and apartment rental listing websites and apps also compete directly with us for guests. Our competitors may continue to adopt aspects of our business model, which could reduce our ability to differentiate our services. For example, some competitors, including traditional hotels, have introduced contactless check-in and self-service technologies that were not previously offered, marketed their services to digital nomads, and have encouraged the development and implementation of in-room communications hubs and other technologies that may permit competitors to offer more technology-enabled guest services. Certain current and potential competitors may also offer inspiring designs at attractive locations or have greater economies of scale and other cost advantages that allow them to offer attractive pricing. We also compete with hotel operators, property rental and management companies, and others to secure leases for attractive properties to add to our portfolio. If we are unsuccessful in offering a distinctive combination of modern, technology-enabled service, and superior design at a competitive price point, or are unable to lease new properties, we may be unable to compete effectively and may be unable to attract new or retain existing guests and landlords.Additionally, current or new competitors may introduce new business models or services that we may need to adopt or otherwise adapt to in order to compete, which could reduce our ability to differentiate our business or services from those of our competitors. For example, some travel intermediaries, like OTAs, are entering into arrangements with hospitality providers that may compete with us more directly. Increased competition could result in a reduction in revenue, fewer attractive properties, higher lease rates, higher costs, or reduced market share.We believe we compete for guests primarily on the basis of the quantity and quality of our units, the global diversity and attractiveness of our units, the quality of our guest experience, and our customer service, brand identity, and price. Competitive factors in our industry are subject to change and if guests choose to use other competitive offerings, our revenue could decrease and we could be required to make additional expenditures to compete more effectively. Any of these events or results could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.Many of our competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition in their markets, well-established guest loyalty programs, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources. Many competitors operate restaurants or other amenities at their properties that our properties may not provide. Future competitors may also have these advantages compared to us. Moreover, the hospitality services industry has experienced significant consolidation, and we expect this trend may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in a highly competitive industry. Consolidation among our competitors could give them increased scale and may enhance their capacity, abilities, and resources, and lower their cost structures. In addition, our current or potential competitors may have access to larger developer, landlord, or guest bases. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, regulatory regimes, or landlord or guest requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, existing and potential landlords and guests might accept our competitors’ offerings, even if they may be inferior to our own. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.23Table of ContentsWe market our units through third-party distribution channels, and if such third parties do not perform adequately or terminate or modify their relationships with us, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.Our success has depended in part on our relationships with third-party distribution channels to list our units online and raise awareness of our brand. In particular, we generate demand by marketing our units with OTAs and other indirect channels, which accounted for over half of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2024. The terms of some of our agreements with these partners allow the partner to change or terminate terms at their discretion. If any of our partners terminate their relationship with us or refuse to renew their agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find alternate providers and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such providers in acceptable time frames. Additionally, many of these OTAs have discretion in how units are listed or prioritized within their platform and may unilaterally reduce the visibility of our units. Our revenues have in the past been and could be adversely affected if our units are not featured prominently or accurately within OTA platforms for any reason, including changes in an OTA’s relationship with us or its competitors, errors by an OTA, outages experienced by an OTA, disruptions in the interconnection of our systems with OTA systems, or otherwise. For example, certain of our units have been temporarily removed from OTA platforms due to misunderstandings about our units’ regulatory status or misclassification of units by local regulators, resulting in lost revenue. If our relationship with an OTA is terminated or the OTA makes changes that reduce the prominence of our units on its platform, our revenue could be materially adversely affected.Our relationships with OTAs and other distribution partners may shift as industry dynamics change after the integration of our portfolio of properties with Marriott, and these third parties may be less willing to partner with us as such shifts occur. For example, should a significant distribution partner adjust its platform to compete more directly with us, that partner may be more likely to promote and sell its own offerings, impose additional conditions on us, or even cease listing our units. Similarly, if any significant distribution partner decided to sell another competitor’s offerings over ours, it could adversely impact our sales and harm our business, operating results, and prospects.Furthermore, any negative publicity related to any of our distribution partners, including any negative publicity related to quality standards, regulatory issues, or privacy or safety concerns at other properties listed by a particular channel partner, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.Our results of operations vary from period-to-period, and historical performance may not be indicative of future performance.Our results of operations have historically varied from period-to-period, and we expect that our results of operations will continue to do so for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our revenue, expenses, operating results, and cash flows, as well as our key operating metrics, have fluctuated from period-to-period in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future. These fluctuations are due to, or may result from, many factors, including:•Changes in the number of our Live Units;•Changes in Occupancy Rates and average length of stay, which dictate many turnover costs;•Seasonal fluctuations in demand in certain markets;•Pricing fluctuations and the proportion of stays booked with extended stay discounts or promotional pricing;•The introduction and performance of new properties, amenities, technologies, and services, including the rate in which new properties are ready for booking;•The effects of, and the extent to which we realize the expected benefits from, our Cash Flow Positive Plan and our portfolio optimization program, and our relationship with Marriott pursuant to the Marriott Agreement;•The timing, cost, and success of advertising and marketing initiatives;•The amount and timing of financing activities, operating expenses, and capital expenditures;•Changes in prevailing lease rates and any adjustments in rental rates under existing leases;•Changes in cash flow due to lease signings, renewals, amendments, and property openings;•Changes in cash flow due to the unpredictability of guest cancellations;•Changes in the cost of labor and supplies due to inflation and supply chain disruptions; •Economic instability in major markets and fluctuations in exchange rates;•Declines or disruptions in the hospitality industry, particularly in cities or regions where we generate substantial revenue;24Table of Contents•The impact of natural disasters and changes in the frequency and severity of natural disasters;•Changes in the mix of stays booked through indirect distribution channels, rather than directly with us, and any changes in fees or relationships with distribution channels;•Unanticipated disruptions or costs due to regulatory issues, including changes in short-term rental laws, hotel regulations, or zoning or accessibility laws;•Litigation and settlement costs, including unforeseen attorneys’ fees and costs;•The impact of a public health crisis;•New accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting standards or practices, particularly any affecting the recognition of revenue and lease accounting;•Fluctuations in the fair value of certain of our financial instruments carried at fair value, which have required and may in the future require us to record non-cash gains or losses in our quarterly results of operations, which may be material and are driven by changes in our stock price and other factors outside of our control;•Any additional impairments of the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets recorded with respect to our operating leases or other impairments of long-lived assets that may be recorded if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset might not be recoverable, which have resulted in and may in the future result in additional non-cash expenses in our results of operations;•New laws or regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, that harm our business or restrict short-term rentals, the hospitality industry, travel, the Internet, e-commerce, online payments, or online communications; and•Other risks described elsewhere herein.Fluctuations in operating results may, particularly if unforeseen, cause us to miss projections or guidance we may have provided to the public. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses and investments, such as our leases, are fixed and such fluctuations in operating results may cause us to face short-term liquidity issues, impact our ability to retain or attract key personnel, expand our portfolio of properties, or cause other unanticipated issues. Company-wide margins may also be difficult to predict because a significant portion of the property portfolio may still be opening or only recently operating at any point in time, and therefore will not be comparable to the profitability of more mature units. In addition, seasonal fluctuations obscure important trends in key metrics such as Adjusted FCF, which may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts and cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline. As a result of the potential variability in our quarterly revenue and operating results, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful, and the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.Certain of the measures we use to evaluate our operating performance are subject to inherent challenges in measurement and may be subject to future adjustments.We track certain operational metrics, including key performance indicators such as Live Units, Contracted Units, Total Portfolio (as described in Part II, Item 7), Room Nights Booked (as described in Part II, Item 7), Bookable Nights (as described in Part II, Item 7), Occupied Nights (as described in Part II, Item 7), Occupancy Rate, Average Daily Rate (“ADR”), and RevPAR, with internal systems and tools that are not independently verified by any third party.While the metrics presented herein are based on what we believe to be reasonable assumptions and estimates, our systems and tools have a number of limitations and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics understate or overstate key performance indicators or contain other technical errors, the data we report or rely upon for planning and forecasting may not be accurate. If investors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.Our business depends on our reputation and the strength of our brand, and any deterioration could adversely impact our market share, revenues, business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.Our business depends on our reputation and the strength of our brand. We believe that the strength of our reputation and brand are important to our ability to attract and retain guests, compete for attractive new properties, and establish and preserve good relationships with the communities, local governmental authorities, and regulators. Many factors can affect our reputation and the strength of our brand, including:25Table of Contents•The quality of guest service and the guest experience, and the nature and severity of guest complaints;•Publicized litigation and negative perception related to property exits;•Guest safety and perceptions of safety;•Guest privacy and data security practices, and any breaches of privacy or data security;•Publicized incidents in or around our properties;•The strength of Marriott’s brand and guests’ perception of our relationship with Marriott;•The delay in our SEC reports resulting from our accounting restatement announced in March 2024; •Our ability to continue as a going concern; •Employee and labor relations;•Any local concerns about perceived over-tourism or the effect of new hotels or other accommodations on affordable housing, noise, or neighborhood congestion;•Our support for local communities, and other community relations matters;•Our approach to supply chain management, sustainability, human rights, and other matters relating to corporate social responsibility;•The extent to which we operate properties that carry the owner’s branding or are co-branded with us;•Our ability to protect and use our brand and trademarks; and•Any perceived or alleged non-compliance with regulatory requirements.Reputational value is also based on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us, our brand, and our properties. It may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate.Our ability to control our reputation and brand is also limited due to the role of third parties in our business. For example, guests who book stays through OTAs and other indirect channels have had and may continue to have issues with their bookings that we do not control, such as refund and cancellation terms, which may result in disputes or otherwise negatively affect our reputation. Similar issues may arise with respect to bookings made through Marriott’s platform and distribution channels. We also rely on third-party companies to provide certain guest services, including housekeeping and linen services at many of our locations, and remote guest support. We do not directly control these companies or their personnel. We also depend upon our landlords to perform important maintenance and other functions at our properties, particularly in common areas, and at many properties we do not control access to or amenities at the entire building, including pools, gyms, and food and beverage services. Guest complaints or negative publicity about our properties, services, or business activities, due to our own operations or actions or omissions of third parties, could diminish consumer confidence in our brand and impair our relationships with guests, landlords, governmental authorities, local residents, third-party business partners, and others that are important to our business.We are involved in and may in the future become involved in claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.We are involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business and may be subject to additional legal proceedings from time to time. Such legal actions include tort and other general liability claims, employee claims, consumer protection claims, violation of privacy claims, commercial disputes, claims by guests, intellectual property claims, securities claims, and disputes with landlords. Due to the potential risks, expenses, and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes even where we have meritorious claims or defenses. We are involved in and may also in the future be the subject of subpoenas, requests for information, reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our business activities. Legal and regulatory proceedings can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources, and cause us to incur significant expenses or liability for substantial damages. The timing and amount of these expenses and damages are difficult to estimate and subject to change, and they could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.We have been and may in the future be subject to liability for the activities of our guests or other incidents at our properties, which could harm our reputation and increase our operating costs.We have been and may in the future be subject to claims of liability based on events that occur during guests’ stays, including those related to robbery, injury, illness, death, physical damage to property, and other similar incidents. These claims could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business and results of operations, even if they do not result in liability, as we may incur costs related to investigation and defense. This risk is heightened due to the fact that, in many cases, we do not control access to certain areas of buildings in which our units are located. From time to time, we 26Table of Contentsmust also spend time and resources resolving issues with guests who remain past their paid stay, which results in lost revenue and higher costs. If we are subject to additional disputes, liability, or claims of liability relating to the acts of our guests, third parties in or around our leased properties (including residents of these properties who are not our guests) or the condition of the leased properties, we may be subject to negative publicity, incur additional expenses, face regulatory or governmental scrutiny, and be subject to liability, any of which could harm our business and operating results.We are subject to claims and liabilities associated with potential health and safety issues and hazardous substances at our properties.We and the developers and owners of our leased properties are exposed to potentially significant liabilities and compliance costs as a result of any hazardous or unsafe conditions at our properties, including under environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as the release, use, storage, and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, such as asbestos, mold, radon gas, or lead, and unsafe or unhealthy conditions at hotels and other residential premises. Failure to comply with these laws, including any required permits or licenses, can result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct operations. Any impairment of our or our landlords’ authority to permit hospitality operations at our leased properties, due to these factors, could harm our reputation and revenue. We could also be liable under environmental, health, and safety laws for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or unsafe or unhealthy conditions at our currently or formerly leased or managed properties, even if we did not know of or cause the presence or release of the substances or conditions, and even where this is contractually the responsibility of our landlord.The presence or release of toxic, unhealthy, or hazardous substances or conditions at our properties could result in governmental investigations and third-party claims for personal injury, property or natural resource damages, business interruption or other losses, and costly disputes with our landlords and guests. For example, we have engaged in litigation with one of our landlords relating to the presence of toxic mold at one property, and we have faced expensive and disruptive claims relating to Legionella bacteria contamination in the water supply at another property, including lawsuits by guests. We expect to encounter claims, governmental investigations, and potential enforcement actions about property conditions and related matters in the future. These claims and the need to investigate, remediate, or otherwise address hazardous, toxic, or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Environmental, health, and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent, and our costs may increase as a result. New or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those related to climate change, could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and restrictions on our business operations.We rely on our third-party landlords to deliver properties to us in a safe and suitable condition, and in most cases we do not undertake to independently verify the safety, suitability, or condition of the properties we lease. We expect to continue to rely on landlords to disclose information about their properties, though such disclosures may be inaccurate or incomplete, and to keep the properties in a safe and compliant condition in accordance with the terms of our leases and applicable law. If unsafe or unhealthy conditions are present or develop at our properties, our guests may be harmed, we may be subject to expensive and disruptive claims, and our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In certain cases, we may undertake to terminate a lease based on a landlord’s failure to remediate an unsafe or unhealthy condition at the property, in which case we could be subject to costly litigation which could harm our business and operating results. We are subject to the risk of financial and reputational damage due to fraud.We have from time to time experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fraud in connection with bookings and payments. The methods used by perpetrators of fraud are complex and constantly evolving. We devote substantial resources to trust and security measures, but they may not detect all fraudulent activity or prevent stays that are disruptive or harmful to neighbors or other guests. As a result, we expect to continue to receive complaints from guests and requests for reimbursement of their payments, as well as actual or threatened related legal action against us, and lost revenue and other financial impacts, due to fraudulent activity or the actions of persons booking stays under false pretenses.27Table of ContentsWe depend on our key personnel and other highly skilled personnel, and if we fail to attract, retain, motivate, or integrate our personnel, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.Our success depends to a significant degree on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key technical, financial, and operations employees and other highly skilled personnel and on our ability to identify, hire, develop, promote, motivate, retain, and integrate highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. For example, we recently announced that Francis Davidson, one of our founders and our former Chief Executive Officer, resigned from the Company. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. In addition, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our management team, work for Sonder on an at-will basis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals.We face intense competition for highly skilled personnel in all areas of our business and there are several factors that may increase the competition for employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer, and we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and existing personnel often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, including due to the decline in our stock price, our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel may be adversely affected. Volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain employees. The value to employees of equity awards that vest over time may be significantly affected by decreases in our stock price (whether or not related to or proportional to our operating performance) and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. We may face challenges in retaining and recruiting such individuals due to sustained declines in our stock price that could reduce the retention value of equity awards.Our continued focus on operational efficiencies, particularly after previous restructurings and other initiatives, and the organizational changes that are expected to result from our new relationship with Marriott, may cause additional uncertainty among existing and prospective employees, which may make it more difficult to retain or attract highly qualified personnel for important roles. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train, and integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to effectively manage our hiring needs, successfully integrate new hires, or effectively retain current employees, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts, and employee morale, productivity, and retention could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.We are subject to risks associated with the employment of hospitality personnel, particularly at locations that employ unionized labor, and the use of third-party guest services contractors.Our hospitality employees and other guest services personnel are critical to our ability to add properties, operate our units, enhance the guest experience, and attract and retain guests. If our relationship with employees in any city, at any key property, or within our central guest services function, deteriorates for any reason, our reputation, guest relationships, and revenue may suffer, and we may incur costs to replace and retrain additional personnel or third-party contractors. In addition, many of our guest services representatives and housekeepers are employed by third-party agencies. Our business and reputation could be harmed in the event of any dispute with these agencies, or if their staff do not provide services that meet our or our standards and expectations. Guest services, live support for guest bookings, and our expenses may also be adversely affected by any event that disrupts the operations of our third-party contractors. For example, we have experienced disruptions to an outsourced service center due to natural disasters, which caused temporary delays in guest responses and other temporary disruptions in our operations. In addition, labor costs are a significant component of our operating expenses, and any increase in the cost of wages, benefits, or other employee-related costs could cause our results of operations and cash flow to be lower than anticipated. Certain cities have also adopted re-hiring ordinances and other requirements with respect to hotel and other hospitality employees, and these and other employment regulations may increase our costs and impair our operations.Like other businesses in the hospitality industry, we may be adversely affected by organized labor activity. Certain of our non-U.S. employees are currently represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement and similar 28Table of Contentsorganized labor activity may occur at other locations. We cannot predict the outcome of any labor-related proposal or other organized labor activity. Increased unionization of our workforce or other collective labor action, new labor legislation, or changes in regulations could be costly, reduce our staffing flexibility, or otherwise disrupt our operations, and reduce our profitability. From time to time, hospitality operations may be disrupted because of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations, or other negative actions and publicity involving employees and third-party contractors. We may also incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs because of disputes involving our workforce. The resolution of labor disputes or new or renegotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, which are a significant component of our operating costs, either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise operating costs.We have identified and may again identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting and may identify material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or other adverse consequences.We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which, if not remediated, could affect the reliability of our consolidated financial statements and have other adverse consequences. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.We have identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 related to: •the process to capture and record lease agreements timely and accurately;•the asset impairment matters;•the process of identifying key metrics, which impact the accounting treatment and valuation of preferred stock; and•deficiencies in the control activities, control environment and information and communication components of the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), relating to (a) establishing and consistently applying formal policies and procedures, and (b) hiring and training sufficient personnel to timely support our internal control objectives to ascertain whether the components of internal controls are present and functioning, as further described in Part II, Item 9A of this report.Although we remain committed to taking actions to remediate these material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, including efforts to enhance our control environment, we can give no assurance that our efforts will succeed in remediating these deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting or that additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting will not be identified in the future.Pursuant to the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, and once we cease to be an emerging growth company, we will be required to include an attestation report on internal controls over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with these requirements within the prescribed time period, we have engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants, and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal controls over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed time period or at all, that our internal controls over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses.Our failure to remediate any material weaknesses, and to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements, including errors that could result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements, and could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and result in other adverse consequences, such as violations of contractual or debt covenants, potential delisting from Nasdaq, SEC or other regulatory investigations, civil or criminal sanctions, or claims or litigation against us, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us, require the expenditure of additional resources, make it more difficult to raise capital, and cause a decline in the price of our common stock and Public Warrants. 29Table of ContentsIf we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the market price of our common stock.We are required to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers. We have experienced delays in filing our reports with the SEC and may experience similar delays in the future. As of December 31, 2024, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of the material weaknesses described above. See Part II, Item 9A of this report for more information. Any failure to implement and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements and reports, which would likely adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities and could subject us to potential delisting from Nasdaq, SEC or other regulatory investigations, civil or criminal sanctions, or claims or litigation against us, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us, require the expenditure of additional resources, make it more difficult to raise capital, and cause a decline in the price of our common stock and Public Warrants. We face risks related to the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and financial information, and that restatement and any future financial restatement or correction may adversely affect us.We are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties which may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business. We expect to continue to face many risks and challenges related to potential errors in future financial statements as the existence of unremedied material weaknesses may not be timely detected and may not prevent errors in future financial statements. The restatement process described in this report has required, and the evaluation of controls, require additional professional fees and internal resources, including management time and attention, which negatively impact our business and financial results. We are also subject to litigation or other claims, disputes, investigations, or proceedings, which may include, among others, claims invoking the federal and state securities laws, governmental investigations, or other claims, related to the above-described restatement, or to weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting or our other controls and procedures.We cannot assure you that all of the risks described above will be eliminated or that the restatement described in this report, or any future restatement, will not cause financial or reputational harm to our business. If one or more of the foregoing risks or challenges persist, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Our delayed SEC filings have made us currently ineligible to use certain registration statements to register the offer and sale of securities, which could have adverse effects including on our ability to raise capital or employee retention and recruitment.Because we were unable to timely file this Form 10-K, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025 (the “Q1 2025 Form 10-Q”), and certain other previous periodic reports with the SEC, we are not eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 until we have timely filed all periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for one year. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to the time we are eligible to use Form S-3, including for purposes of raising capital or permitting the resale of privately placed securities, we will be required to file a registration statement on Form S-1 and have it reviewed and declared effective by the SEC. Doing so would likely take longer than filing a registration statement on Form S-3 and increase our transaction costs, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially harming our liquidity and financial condition. We have also been unable to have our resale registration statement on Form S-1 declared effective due to our delayed SEC filings. We will also need to file a post-effective amendment on Form S-1 to convert our previous Form S-3 registration statement with respect to resales of securities into a Form S-1, which may be reviewed and will need to be declared effective by the SEC. We cannot predict when we will regain eligibility to use Form S-3 or have an effective Form S-1, due in part to the uncertainties associated with our previously announced financial restatement process and the possibility of additional delays in our SEC filings.30Table of ContentsFurthermore, our failure to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC resulted in the suspension of the availability of Form S-8 for issuances of shares pursuant to our equity incentive plans for employees and directors. For that reason, employees and directors have not been permitted to exercise outstanding stock options or receive unrestricted shares of our common stock pursuant to restricted stock units or other equity awards, and we will remain unable to grant other equity awards under our Form S-8 registration statements, until such time that we are deemed to have filed all reports and other materials required to be filed under the Exchange Act, including the Q1 2025 Form 10-Q. The suspension of our ability to utilize Form S-8 has adversely impacted employee morale, incentives, and recruitment, and if we fail to file future required reports, our ability to use Form S-8 for the above purposes will remain or again be suspended, which could adversely affect our business.We rely on certain third-party services and technologies, and any defects or failures in these technologies or any inability to obtain or integrate third-party technologies could harm our business.We rely on software and other technologies and services supplied by third parties to provide certain services to us and our guests, including internal communications, customer service communications, web hosting, payment processing of guest credit cards, fraud prevention, lease management, accounting and other internal functions, and other technologies employed to facilitate bookings and guest use and enjoyment of our properties, such as digital locks and streaming television services. As we increase the use of third-party systems in our business and as new technology is developed, the integration of our products and services with one another and other companies’ offerings creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is also increasingly reliant on third parties. Our business may be adversely affected to the extent such software, services, and technologies contain errors or vulnerabilities, are compromised, experience outages, are depreciated or functionally reduced by vendors, or otherwise fail to meet expectations. Errors, outages, vulnerabilities, depreciation, and other issues with third-party software, services, and technologies have occurred in the past, and additional issues can be expected to occur in the future. Third-party vendors may also fail to provide timely and effective support. Our increasing reliance on third parties for technology development and support may also subject us to additional risks, including potential challenges in protecting our intellectual property rights in the related technology, and reduced control over the individuals working on our technology projects. Any of these risks could increase our costs and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Incorporating technology from third parties to operate our business can result in the infringement of intellectual property rights of others or in our suppliers and licensors in all jurisdictions in which we may operate. If we are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of this technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our suppliers and licensors or against us, our ability to operate some aspects of our business could be severely limited and our business could be harmed. In addition, some of our license agreements may be terminated by our licensors for convenience. If we are unable to obtain necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternate technology, which may require significant time and effort and may be of lower quality or performance standards. This would limit and delay our ability to provide new or competitive offerings and increase our costs. In addition, we may be unable to enter into new agreements on commercially reasonable terms or develop our own technologies and amenities relying on or containing technology previously obtained from third parties. If alternate technology cannot be obtained or developed, we may not be able to offer certain functionality to our guests or manage our business as we had intended, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.We rely on third-party payment processors to process payments, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.We rely on third-party payment processors to process payments. If any of our third-party payment processors terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find alternate payment processors, and we may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processors in an acceptable time frame. Furthermore, the software and services provided by our third-party payment processors may fail to meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to landlords, any of which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain guests or disrupt our operations.Nearly all payments made to us are made by credit card, debit card, or through a third-party payment service, which subjects us to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to guests that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. We are also subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to 31Table of Contentspayments, including with respect to money laundering, money transfers, privacy, and information security, and these regulations may differ by locality and can be expected to change over time.If our data or information technology systems, or those of third parties with whom we work, are or were again compromised, we could experience, and have in the past experienced, adverse consequences, including regulatory investigations or actions, litigation (including class claims), fines and penalties, disruptions of our business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue or profits, loss of guest loyalty or sales, and other adverse consequences.In the ordinary course of business, we and the third parties with whom we work collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share (collectively, “process”) personal data and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, sensitive third-party data, business plans, transactions, and financial information (collectively, “sensitive data”). Cyberattacks, malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our sensitive information and information technology systems, and those of the third parties upon which we rely. Following the integration of our properties with Marriott’s platform and systems pursuant to the Marriott Agreement, the aforementioned third parties include Marriott, and any third parties whose technologies, services, or systems are incorporated into Marriott’s platform or systems or on which Marriott otherwise relies. Such threats are prevalent and continue to rise, are increasingly difficult to detect, and come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer “hackers,” threat actors, “hacktivists,” organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation states, and nation-state-supported actors. Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyberattacks, including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. We and the third parties with whom we work are subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social engineering attacks (including through phishing and so-called deep fake attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service and credential stuffing attacks, credential harvesting, personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. We have experienced targeted and organized phishing and account takeover attacks and may experience more in the future. Severe ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations and ability to provide services to our guests, loss or unavailability of sensitive data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments or other challenges. It may be difficult and costly to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate a security incident and our efforts to do so may not be successful. Actions taken by us or the third parties with whom we work to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate a security incident could result in outages, data losses, and disruptions of our business. Threat actors may also gain access to other networks and systems after a compromise of our networks and systems. The foregoing risks are likely to increase as we expand our business, integrate our products and services with those of third parties or at new properties, and store and process more data, including personal data, and as the use of generative artificial intelligence may permit more automated and effective attacks. Our efforts to protect information from unauthorized access may be unsuccessful or may result in the rejection of legitimate attempts to book reservations, each of which could result in lost business and have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and results of operations.Additionally, past or future business transactions (such as integrations of our systems and technologies with those of commercial partners or any businesses we may acquire) could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. Among other things, our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in the third-party systems and technologies, or created by the integration. Furthermore, we may discover security issues that were not found during our analysis of any third-party business partner, and it may be difficult to integrate our information technology environment and security program with those of other companies. 32Table of ContentsWe rely on third parties and their technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive data in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, data center facilities, employee email, content delivery to guests, and other functions. We also rely on third parties to provide other products, services, or technologies. Our ability to monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of the information security practices of these third parties is limited. If the third parties experience a security incident or other interruption or disruption, we could experience adverse consequences. While we may be entitled to damages if those third parties fail to satisfy their privacy- or security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages or we may be unable to recover such award. In addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that infrastructure of third-parties in our supply chain have not been compromised. Any of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption that could result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, unavailability, or disclosure of, or access to, our sensitive data or our information technology systems, or those of the third parties upon whom we rely. A security incident or other interruption or disruption could disrupt our ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our services.Our security measures may not be successful in preventing security breaches and other incidents. We have previously experienced and may again experience security incidents that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive data. In addition, sensitive information about our company or guests could be leaked, disclosed, or revealed as a result of or in connection with the use of generative artificial intelligence technologies by our vendors, contractors, or employees. While we take steps designed to detect, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities in our information systems, we may not be able to detect and remediate all vulnerabilities on a timely basis or at all, in part because the threats and techniques used to exploit the vulnerability change frequently and are often sophisticated in nature. Therefore, such vulnerabilities could be exploited but may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. These vulnerabilities may pose material risks to our business, including the risk that they result in material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. We may experience or identify additional security vulnerabilities. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities. Security incidents, whether actual or perceived, experienced by us or third parties on whom we rely may result in adverse consequences, such as government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections), additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing sensitive data (including personal data), litigation (including class claims), indemnification obligations, negative publicity, reputational harm, monetary fund diversions, interruptions in our operations (including availability of data), voluntary or mandatory notifications of guests, regulators, and other relevant stakeholders, the provision of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services or other potentially costly actions, lost revenues or other financial loss, and other similar harms. For example, in August 2023, a purported class action lawsuit was filed against the Company in connection with a previous security incident, asserting claims based on the Company’s alleged failure to secure and safeguard the personally identifiable information of the putative class, which was subsequently dismissed. Security incidents and attendant consequences may cause guests to stop using our services, deter new guests from using our services, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business, including by damaging our reputation. We incur costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents and we expect our costs will increase as we make improvements to our systems and processes designed to prevent further breaches and incidents. In the event of a future breach or incident, we could be required to expend additional significant capital and other resources in an effort to prevent further breaches or incidents, which may require us to divert substantial resources. Moreover, we could be required or otherwise find it appropriate to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to, notify third parties of, and otherwise address the incident or breach and its root cause. These issues are likely to become more difficult to manage as we expand the number of jurisdictions where we operate and the number and variety of services we offer, as we integrate our systems and technologies with those of additional third parties, and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced. Our insurance policies have coverage limits and deductibles and such insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from or mitigate liabilities and losses caused by security breaches or incidents or otherwise related to our data privacy, protection, and security obligations, and we cannot be sure that such coverage will pay future claims or will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Additionally, our contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy, protection, and security obligations.System capacity constraints or operational failures could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.33Table of ContentsWe have experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our website and usage of our app, and our portfolio of properties has grown and diversified. If our technologies, systems, and network infrastructure cannot be expanded, are not scaled to cope with increased demand, or fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in bookings and guest service, slower response times, decreased guest satisfaction, and delays in our operations.In the event of certain system failures, we may not have back-up systems, or may be unable to switch to back-up systems immediately, and the time to full recovery could be prolonged. We have experienced system failures from time to time, including failures of important guest-facing systems such as keyless entry systems. In addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff, these outages can create a significant number of guest issues and complaints that need to be resolved by our guest services team. Any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate and significant loss of revenue, an increase in guest support costs (including refunds and reimbursements), harm our reputation, and could result in some consumers switching to competitors or making claims against us. If we experience frequent or persistent system failures, our brand and reputation could be permanently and significantly harmed, and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Our ongoing efforts to increase the reliability of our systems may be expensive and may not be completely effective in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime or in system errors affecting guest experience or our operations. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur.We use both internally developed systems and third-party systems to operate our mobile app, website, and other critical infrastructure, including transaction and payment processing, financial and accounting systems, and certain technology-enabled features at guest properties, with systems provided by both commercial software providers and Marriott. If the number of users of our systems increases substantially, or if critical internally developed or third-party systems stop operating as designed, we or our providers may need to significantly upgrade, expand, or repair such systems and other infrastructure. We or our providers may not be able to upgrade these systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner and our systems could be impacted for a meaningful period of time, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The software underlying our services is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in the codes used after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of guests, disruption to our sales channels, loss of revenue, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our growth prospects and business.Supply chain interruptions may increase our costs or reduce our revenues.We depend on beneficial vendor relationships and the effectiveness of our supply chain management systems to ensure reliable and sufficient supply, on reasonably favorable terms, of materials used in our renovation, building openings, and operating activities, such as furniture, linens, unit decor and appliances, lighting, security equipment, and consumables. The materials we purchase and use in the ordinary course of our business are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers around the world, including Vietnam, China, India, and the United States. We have experienced and may again experience disruptions in our supply chain, including those that result from public health crises, weather-related events, natural disasters, trade restrictions, tariffs, cyberattacks, increases in interest rates, inflationary pressures, border controls, acts of war, terrorist attacks, third-party strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns, shipping capacity constraints, supply or shipping interruptions, or other factors beyond our control. In the event of disruptions in our existing supply chain, the labor and materials we rely on may not be available at reasonable rates or at all. In some cases, we may rely on a single source for procurement of furniture or other supplies in a given region. Our supply chain also depends on third-party warehouses and logistics providers. Any disruption in the supply, storage, or delivery of materials to our properties could disrupt operations at our existing locations or significantly delay our opening of a new location, which may cause harm to our reputation and results of operations.34Table of ContentsWe may be subject to liability claims and our insurance may be inadequate to cover our losses.We are subject to various types of liability claims in the operation of our business. Despite the procedures, systems, and internal controls we have implemented to avoid or mitigate risks, we have experienced and may experience additional claims and incur liabilities, whether through a weakness in these procedures, systems and internal controls, or because of negligence or the willful act of an employee, contractor, guest, or other third-party. Our insurance policies may be inadequate to cover the potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from incidents related to our units or leased properties, guest or employee acts or omissions, disruptions in our service, including those caused by cybersecurity incidents, failures or disruptions to our infrastructure, catastrophic events, and disasters, or otherwise. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all, and insurance may not cover all claims made against us and related costs.Our business is subject to the risks of natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, public health concerns, and other catastrophic events.A significant natural disaster could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, climate change could result in an increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters and cause performance problems with our technology infrastructure. Although we maintain incident management and disaster response plans, in the event of a major disruption caused by a natural disaster or man-made problem, or outbreak of pandemic diseases or other public health crises, we may be unable to continue our operations and may experience system interruptions and reputational harm. Acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest or armed conflict could also cause disruptions in our business or the business of our landlords, vendors or other business partners, or the economy as a whole. Public health concerns and related governmental and business responses had, and may again have, an adverse effect on our customers, employees, landlords and other potential business partners, and our operations. For example, public health concerns and efforts to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases have caused severe economic disruptions around the world as governments, public institutions, and other organizations imposed or recommended, at various times and degrees, restrictions on a wide array of activities, including travel and in-person gatherings, mandatory vaccination requirements, quarantines, and lock-downs. Disease outbreaks have drastically reduced and may again drastically reduce demand for accommodations, adversely impact guest services, and require us to take drastic steps to reduce operating costs, including phasing units from our portfolio and laying off or furloughing employees. Similar actions that may be taken in response to any future public health crisis may adversely impact our business, operations, growth, and financial results. Our technology contains third-party open-source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to operate as intended or could increase our costs.Our technology contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and distribution of open-source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of their products. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our technology.Some open-source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open-source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.Although we monitor our use of open-source software to avoid subjecting our technology to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our technology. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open-source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open-source software in our technology will be effective. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face 35Table of Contentsinfringement or other liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our offerings on terms that may not be economically feasible, re-engineer our technology, discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.We may be unable to protect our brand and other intellectual property, and we have been and may be subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to intellectual property rights.Our intellectual property is important to our success. We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, employee, and third-party non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other methods to protect our intellectual property. However, these only afford limited protection, and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services, technology, mobile app, algorithms, or other features and functionality, or to use information that we consider proprietary or confidential. There can be no assurance that any of our intellectual property will be protectable by patents and any unsuccessful efforts to obtain patent protection may harm our business. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights, and similar proprietary rights. We endeavor to defend our intellectual property rights diligently, but intellectual property litigation is expensive, time-consuming, and may divert managerial attention and resources from our business objectives. We may not be able to successfully defend our intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, brand, and results of operations.From time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we have been and may be subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties will continue to assert intellectual property claims, in particular trademark claims, against us, particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business. Successful claims against us could result in a significant monetary liability or prevent us from operating our business, or portions of our business. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to obtain licenses to use intellectual property rights belonging to third parties, which may be expensive to procure, or to cease using those rights altogether. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.We expend resources relating to the opening, operation, and maintenance of our leased properties, which may be higher than anticipated.We typically devote resources to prepare a newly leased property for its initial guests and to keep our leased properties in a safe and attractive condition and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We may be required to expend substantial resources to remedy any noncompliance at our leased properties, or to defend against complaints of noncompliance, even if they lack merit. Although we endeavor to have the landlord or developer bear the out-of-pocket opening costs, we are sometimes responsible for all or a portion of these costs. Even where landlords and developers are contractually responsible for some costs, they have in the past and may in the future dispute or fail to comply with their obligations. In addition, while the majority of our leases require landlords to bear responsibility for the repair and maintenance of building structures and systems, at times we are responsible for some of these obligations, and in most cases, we are responsible for the repair and maintenance of damage caused by our guests. Our leases may also require that we return the space to the landlord at the end of the lease term in essentially the same condition it was delivered to us, which may require repair work. The costs associated with our building openings, repair, and maintenance may be significant and may vary from our forecasts. Additionally, failing to comply with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, injunctive action, costly legal proceedings, an award of damages to private litigants, mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance, reputational harm, and other business effects that could materially and adversely affect our brand and results of operationsWe also periodically refurbish some of our units to keep pace with the changing needs of our guests and to maintain our brand and reputation. Although we include estimated refurbishments in our business and financial planning, refurbishments may result in lost revenues at the affected unit, be more costly and time-consuming than expected, impair guest experience, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.Our properties are concentrated in a limited number of cities, which increases our exposure to local factors affecting demand or hospitality operations.36Table of ContentsOur operations are relatively concentrated in a limited number of cities, and we expect that the majority of our operations will continue to be concentrated in a limited number of cities. As of December 31, 2024, our five largest cities (New York City, Dubai, Montreal, Miami, and London) accounted for approximately 37% of our Live Units, and our 10 largest cities accounted for approximately 60% of our Live Units. Geographic concentration magnifies the risk to us of localized economic, political, public health, and other conditions such as natural disasters. Civil unrest, public health crises, unusual weather, natural disasters, or other factors affecting travel to these cities or other markets in which we are expanding, as well as changes in local competitive conditions and regulations affecting the hospitality industry, may have a disproportionate negative effect on our revenue and on our ability to secure sufficient staffing, supplies, or services for our largest markets.We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.Since we conduct a portion of our business outside the United States but report our results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. In addition, fluctuation in our mix of U.S. and foreign currency denominated transactions may contribute to this effect as exchange rates vary. Moreover, as a result of these exchange rate fluctuations, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and other operating results may differ materially from expectations when translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. For example, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies, our non-U.S. revenue would be adversely affected when translated into U.S. dollars. Conversely, a decline in the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase our non-U.S. revenue when translated into U.S. dollars. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and other operating results, may differ materially from expectations. In addition, our revenue and operating results are subject to fluctuation if our mix of U.S. and foreign currency denominated transactions and expenses changes in the future. We do not currently have hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency exposure. If we do enter into such arrangements in the future, such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results.If we are unable to introduce new or upgraded amenities, services, or features that guests recognize as valuable, we may fail to attract guests, property developers, and landlords. Our efforts to develop new and upgraded services and amenities could require us to incur significant costs and losses.In order to continue to attract new guests and generate repeat bookings from previous guests, and to attract property developers, and landlords, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new amenities, services, and features that add value to the Sonder brand and differentiate us from our competitors, including those we develop ourselves or obtain from third parties. The success of any new amenity, service, or feature depends on several factors, including its timely completion, strategic introduction, and market acceptance, all of which remain subject to various uncertainties. If guests, property developers, and landlords do not recognize the value of the new amenities, services, or features, they may choose not to engage with us. Developing and delivering these new or upgraded amenities, services, and features is costly and involves inherent risks and difficulties. Consumer preferences for interior design and furnishings and technology-related services are subject to frequent change. Technology development efforts may be unsuccessful and any new features or services offered to guests through our website or app may be difficult to manage or maintain. In addition, some new or upgraded amenities, services, and features may be difficult for us to continue to market, require additional regulatory permits and personnel, subject us to additional liabilities, and involve unfavorable pricing or fees. Further, the efforts required to develop, integrate, launch, and maintain new amenities, services, and features could divert resources away from other projects and initiatives. We cannot guarantee that such efforts will succeed or that new or upgraded amenities, services, and features will work as intended, provide their expected value, or result in a positive return on investment.37Table of ContentsChanges in our effective tax rate could harm our future operating results.We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and in various international jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors, including:•Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates;•Effects of certain non-tax-deductible expenses, including those arising from the requirement to expense stock options;•Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;•Adverse outcomes resulting from any tax audit, including transfer pricing adjustments with respect to intercompany transactions;•Our ability to utilize our net operating losses, research and development credits, and other deferred tax assets; and•Changes in accounting principles or changes in tax laws and regulations, or the application of the tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules.Our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements cause us to be subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects.We generally conduct our international operations through wholly owned subsidiaries and are or may be required to report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by tax authorities in various jurisdictions. The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of such jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws, interpretations of existing tax laws and policies, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The relevant tax authorities have in the past disagreed and may in the future disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If additional disagreements were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations.In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) issued final action items or proposals related to its initiative to combat base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”). One BEPS proposal redefines a “permanent establishment” under treaty tax law, and changes how profits would be attributed to the permanent establishment. The OECD also introduced a framework, referred to as Pillar Two, which contemplates a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% for companies with revenue exceeding a minimum threshold and was implemented by the Council of the European Union and its member states and has been implemented or considered for implementation by other jurisdictions. However, the current administration has withdrawn support for Pillar Two and Pillar Two does not currently apply to the Company. Some of the BEPS and related proposals, and changes in reaction to such proposals, if applicable in the countries where we do business, could increase the burden and costs of our tax compliance and our global effective tax rate if they become applicable to us.We currently collect and remit applicable sales taxes and other applicable transaction taxes in jurisdictions where we, through our employees or economic activity, have a presence and where we have determined, based on applicable legal precedents, that sales of travel accommodations are classified as taxable. We do not currently collect and remit state and local excise, utility user, or transfer taxes, fees, or surcharges in jurisdictions where we believe we do not have sufficient “nexus.” There is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient nexus for a state or local jurisdiction to levy taxes, fees, and surcharges on sales made over the Internet, and there is also uncertainty as to whether our characterization of our traveler accommodations in certain jurisdictions will be accepted by state and local tax authorities. For example, in January 14, 2025, the Upper Tribunal in the United Kingdom ruled that Sonder Europe was required to account for value added taxes (“VAT”) on the full value of its supplies to travelers. While we intend to appeal this decision, if our appeal is unsuccessful, our tax situation in the United Kingdom could be adversely affected.38Table of ContentsThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use, value added, goods and services, business, and gross receipts taxes, to businesses that transact online, such as ours, is a complex and evolving area. Where we sell our services through OTAs, we do not directly control how taxes are collected or remitted. There are substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or may conduct business, and resource and local personnel constraints can make it difficult for us to collect local taxes due from guests accurately, which could result in unanticipated additional tax liabilities. If an OTA does not collect such taxes from travelers, we could be held liable for such obligations. The application of existing or future indirect tax laws, whether in the United States or internationally, or the failure to collect and remit such taxes, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects.If existing tax laws, rules or regulations are amended, or if new unfavorable tax laws, rules or regulations are enacted, including with respect to occupancy, sales, value-added taxes, withholding taxes, revenue-based taxes, unclaimed property, or other tax laws applicable to the multinational businesses, the results of these changes could increase our tax liabilities. Possible outcomes include double taxation, multiple levels of taxation, or additional obligations, prospectively or retrospectively, including the potential imposition of interest and penalties. Demand for our products and services could decrease if such costs are passed on to our guests, result in increased costs to update or expand our technical or administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of our business activities should we decide not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions.Our ability to use net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited due to prior and potential future ownership changes. Our net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS") and state and foreign tax authorities, and our ability to use such NOLs and other tax attributes may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and similar state provisions. In general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs or tax credits to offset future taxable income or taxes. For these purposes, an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of a corporation’s stock increases their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period. We believe we have undergone an ownership change in the past, and we may undergo one or more ownership changes in the future. If our ability to use our historical NOLs or credits is materially limited due to prior or potential future ownership changes, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. Section 382 and 383 of the Code would apply to all net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, whether the carryforward period is indefinite or not. If we earn taxable income, such limitations could result in increased future tax liability to us, and our future cash flows could be adversely affected.Failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws and similar laws, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.We are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. Travel Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in countries outside of the United States in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, agents, representatives, business partners, and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or sometimes the private sector.We sometimes engage third parties to conduct our business abroad. We and our employees, agents, representatives, business partners and third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We cannot guarantee that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, the risks under these laws may increase.These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we 39Table of Contentscannot guarantee that none of our employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries will take actions in violation of Company policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.Any allegations of or actual violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws could result in whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and prospects. Responding to any investigation or action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions programs that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls.In many cases, our business activities are subject to U.S. and international import and export control laws and regulations including trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. For example, restrictions may exist on our ability to provide services to persons located in certain U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries or listed on certain lists of sanctioned persons. U.S. and other international authorities recently imposed, and may further impose, sanctions related to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Additionally, the import of furniture used in various properties must be conducted in accordance with applicable import laws and regulations. While we have policies and procedures in place designed to ensure compliance with sanctions and trade restrictions and other applicable laws, our employees, contractors, partners, and agents may take actions in violation of such policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. If we were to fail to comply with such import or export control laws and regulations, trade and economic sanctions, or other similar laws, we could be subject to both civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration for employees and managers for willful violations, damage to our reputation, and the possible loss of export or import privileges, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Risks Related to Government RegulationUnfavorable changes in government regulations or taxation of the short-term and long-term rental, Internet, and e-commerce industries could harm our operating results.We operate in markets throughout the world and are subject to various regulatory and taxation requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our regulatory compliance efforts are burdensome because each local jurisdiction has different requirements, including with respect to zoning, licensing, permitting, sanitation, accessibility, taxes, employment, labor and health and safety, and regulations in the industry are constantly evolving. Compliance requirements that vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction reduce our ability to achieve economies of scale, add compliance costs, and increase the potential liability for compliance deficiencies. Additionally, laws or regulations that increase our costs, require changes in our business practices, or otherwise harm our business could be adopted, or interpreted in a manner that affects our activities, including but not limited to the regulation of personal and consumer information, consumer advertising, labor laws, accessibility, health and safety, taxation, and real estate, hotel licensing, and zoning requirements. Violations or new interpretations of these laws or regulations may result in penalties, disrupt our ability to operate existing properties or to develop new ones, negatively impact our guest relations or operations in other ways, increase our expenses, and damage our reputation and business. Even when we are in compliance with applicable laws, a suspected violation of these laws or regulations can temporarily disrupt our ability to operate existing properties, negatively impact our guest relations or operations in other ways, damage our reputation and business, and result in loss of revenues, even if the matter is ultimately resolved in our favor.40Table of ContentsIn addition, there have been, and continue to be, regulatory developments that affect our ability to offer units for specified durations or in certain neighborhoods. For example, some municipalities have adopted ordinances that limit our ability to offer certain properties to guests for fewer than a stated number of consecutive nights, such as 30 nights, or for more than an aggregate total number of nights per year, and other cities may introduce similar regulations, including after we have already leased properties and booked guests. The regulation of short-term rentals and related government enforcement efforts have been increasing in scope and intensity in many cities, often due to government concerns about affordable housing or over-tourism, or due to pressures from private groups such as neighborhood associations. Even where we operate in compliance with existing regulations, local groups or governments have occasionally argued that we should comply with additional or different requirements, and similar developments can be expected in the future. Any such developments could reduce our revenues by limiting our ability to open or continue operating at certain properties or in certain cities, damage our reputation with landlords and others, result in expensive and disruptive disputes or regulatory proceedings, or require burdensome changes to our operations. In addition, many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose taxes or other obligations on travel and hospitality companies were established before the growth of the Internet and e-commerce, which creates a risk of these laws being used in ways not originally intended that could harm our business. These and other similar new and newly interpreted regulations could increase our costs, require us to reduce or even cease operations in certain locations, reduce the diversity and number of units available for us to lease and offer to guests, and otherwise harm our business and operating results.From time to time, we have been involved in and expect to continue to become involved in challenges to or disputes with government agencies regarding interpretations of laws and regulations. New, changed, or newly interpreted or applied laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances, could also increase landlords’ compliance, operating and other costs. This, in turn, could deter landlords from renting their properties to us, negatively affect lease renewals, impair landlords’ ability or willingness to repair and maintain leased properties, or increase costs of doing business. Any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance.We will continue to incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, key members of our management team have limited experience managing a public company.We incur substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses as a public company, and these expenses may increase even more after we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the rules and regulations of the SEC, and the listing standards of Nasdaq. Our management and other employees devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these requirements and we expect these rules and regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs. For example, these rules and regulations make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board of Directors (the “Board”), particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, or as our executive officers. In addition, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Some members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage the significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws, and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors, associated with being a public company. These obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.41Table of ContentsWe and the third parties with whom we work are subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, rules, contractual obligations, industry standards, policies, and other obligations relating to data privacy, protection, and security. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations has and could again result in adverse consequences, including but not limited to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation (including class claims), fines and penalties, disruptions of our business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue or profits, loss of customers or sales, and other adverse business consequences.Our data processing activities subject us to numerous data privacy, protection, and security obligations, such as various laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contractual requirements, and other obligations relating to data privacy and security. In the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), and other similar laws. In the past few years, numerous U.S. states, including states in which we operate, have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and giving residents certain rights concerning their personal data. Such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling, and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may adversely impact our business and ability to provide our services. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the CCPA applies to personal data of consumers, business representatives, and employees, and requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of California residents to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for civil penalties per violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. Similar laws have been enacted or are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels, and we expect more states to pass similar laws in the future. These developments may further complicate compliance efforts and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties upon whom we rely.Outside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards govern data privacy, protection, and security, and our collection, processing, and security of data may be subject to these laws, regulations, and industry standards. For example, the GDPR imposes strict requirements for processing personal data. In Canada, the PIPEDA, Canada’s Anti-Span Legislation, and various related provincial laws may apply to our operations. The penalties for violation of these international laws, regulations, and industry standards can be severe. In the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Europe and other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal data to other countries. In particular, the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the UK have significantly restricted the transfer of personal data to the United States and other countries whose privacy laws they believe are inadequate. Other jurisdictions may adopt similarly stringent interpretations of their data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and UK to the United States in compliance with law, such as the EEA’s standard contractual clauses, the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, and the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. If there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal data from the EEA, the UK or other jurisdictions to the United States, if we fail to comply with the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer or such requirements are too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate part of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant expense, increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work with partners, vendors, and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of personal data necessary to operate our business. Additionally, companies that transfer personal data out of the EEA and UK to other jurisdictions, particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from regulators, individual litigants, and activist groups. Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to suspend or permanently cease certain transfers out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations. 42Table of ContentsWe could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. For example, federal, state, and international governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of third-party “cookies” and other methods of online tracking for behavioral advertising and other purposes. The United States and foreign governments have enacted, have considered, or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to engage in these activities, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools or the use of data gathered with such tools. For example, in the EEA and the UK, regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements related to the targeted advertising ecosystem. European regulators have issued significant fines in certain circumstances where the regulators alleged that appropriate consent was not obtained in connection with targeted advertising activities. In the United States, the CCPA grants California residents the right to opt-out of a company’s sharing of personal data for advertising purposes in exchange for money or other valuable consideration and requires covered businesses to honor user-enabled browser signals from the Global Privacy Control. Additionally, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented, or announced plans to implement, means to make it easier for Internet users to prevent the placement of cookies or to block other tracking technologies, which could, if widely adopted, result in the use of third-party cookies and other methods of online tracking becoming significantly less effective. Regulation of the use of these cookies and other online tracking and advertising practices, or a loss in our ability to make effective use of services that employ such technologies, could increase our costs of operations, and limit our ability to track trends, optimize our services, or acquire new guests on cost-effective terms and consequently, materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. As a result, we may be required to change the way we market our accommodations and services.Additionally, under various privacy laws and other obligations, we may be required to obtain certain consents to process personal data. For example, some of our data processing practices may be challenged under wiretapping laws, if we obtain consumer information from third parties through various methods, including chatbot and session replay providers, or via third-party marketing pixels. Recently, these practices have been subject to increased challenges by class action plaintiffs, and our inability or failure to obtain consent for these practices could result in adverse consequences, including class action litigation and mass arbitration demands. Such a demand could allow for the recovery of statutory damages on a per violation basis, which could be significant depending on the volume of data and the number of violations.Regulators and legislatures at the local, state, and national level are also taking an increased interest in regulating the collection and use of biometric data, which plays an important role in our trust and safety processes. Specifically, the third parties that provide the identity verification process for us may use facial geometry data to verify that a guest’s selfie picture matches the photograph on the government-issued identification provided by the guest, similar to a front desk worker at a traditional hotel visually comparing a guest’s government identification to the guest’s face. Legislation such as the EU GDPR and the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”), as well as other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, place tight regulation on the collection, use, and sharing of biometric information, as well as requirements for notice and consent from individual data subjects. Violations of these laws may result in significant fines, damages, and other penalties. For example, BIPA provides for substantial penalties and statutory damages and has generated significant class action activity, and the cost of litigating and settling any claims that we have violated BIPA or similar laws could be significant. New laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and sharing of biometric data have also recently been proposed or enacted in other states, and the eventual impact of those laws and regulations on Sonder’s operations remains uncertain. A failure, or alleged or perceived failure, by us to comply with these requirements could adversely affect our reputation, brand, and business, and may result in claims, proceedings, or actions against us by governmental entities or private litigants or require us to change our operations and/or our ability to ensure the safety of our guests, which could adversely affect our reputation or require us to make significant investments in new technologies or processes.Additionally, our employees and personnel use generative artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies to perform their work, and the use, disclosure and other processing of personal data by or with generative AI technologies is subject to various privacy laws and other privacy obligations. Governments have passed and are likely to pass additional laws regulating generative AI. Our use of this technology could result in additional compliance costs, regulatory investigations and actions, and lawsuits. We use AI and machine learning (“ML”) to assist us in making certain decisions, which is regulated by certain laws and regulations. Due to inaccuracies or flaws in the inputs, outputs, or logic of AI or ML, the model could be biased and could lead us to make decisions that could bias certain individuals (or classes of individuals), and adversely impact their rights, employment, and ability to obtain certain pricing, products, services, or benefits. If we are unable to use AI or ML, or face substantial restrictions or compliance burdens in connection with our doing so, it could make our business less efficient and result in competitive disadvantages. 43Table of ContentsThe EU also has implemented new and revised laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity, including the Network and Information Security Directive II (“NIS2”), adopted in 2023, which aims to enhance cybersecurity across critical infrastructure and essential services in the EU. NIS2 provides for all EU member states to have issued implementing legislation by October 2024; however, several EU member states have not finalized their respective legislation and guidance. We may incur substantial expense in complying with obligations under laws and regulations relating to data privacy, protection, and security in the EU, United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions, and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall.Obligations related to data privacy, protection, and security (and expectations from consumers) are quickly changing, becoming increasingly stringent, and creating uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be extremely complex, and subject to different and inconsistent applications and interpretations. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources, which may necessitate changes to our services, information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. We may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in our efforts to comply with our data privacy, protection, or security obligations. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties on whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations. If we or the third parties with whom we work fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable data privacy, protection, or security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including (but not limited to) government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections), litigation (including class-action claims) and mass arbitration demands, additional reporting requirements and oversight, indemnification obligations, bans on processing personal data or credit cards, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. For example, in August 2023, a purported class action lawsuit was filed against the Company asserting claims based on the Company’s alleged failure to secure and safeguard the personally identifiable information of the putative class, which was subsequently dismissed. Additionally, plaintiffs have become increasingly active in bringing privacy- and security-related claims against companies, including class claims and mass arbitration demands. Some of these claims allow for the recovery of statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for significant statutory damages, depending on the volume of data and the number of violations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.Failure to comply with consumer protection, marketing and advertising laws, including with regard to direct marketing and internet marketing practices, could result in fines or place restrictions on our business.Our business is subject to various laws and regulations governing consumer protection, advertising, and marketing. We have encountered and may continue to encounter governmental and private party investigations and complaints in areas such as the clarity, transparency, accuracy, and presentation of information on our website or in third-party listings of our properties, which are common in our industry. In addition, our marketing activities will be subject to various laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally that govern online and other direct marketing and advertising practices. For example, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”) imposes specific requirements on communications with customers and various consumer consent requirements and other restrictions on certain communications with consumers by phone, fax or text message. TCPA violations can result in significant financial penalties, including penalties or criminal fines imposed by the Federal Communications Commission or fines of up to $1,500 per violation imposed through private litigation or by state authorities. Our marketing activities could be restricted, our guest relationships and revenues could be adversely affected, and our costs could increase, due to changes required in our marketing, listing, or booking practices, or any investigations, complaints, or other adverse developments related to these laws and regulations.Industry-specific payment regulations and standards are evolving, and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business.Our payment processors expect attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standards. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls due to changes in business processes, supporting technology, or core technology, or if our third-party payment processors are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. For example, failing to maintain our attestation of compliance for PCI could result in monthly fines or other adverse consequences until compliance is re-established via an external PCI qualified security assessor. Existing third parties or future business partnerships may opt out of processing payment card transactions if we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our guests, business partners, and other third parties.44Table of ContentsRisks Related to Indebtedness and LiquidityThere is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, and this may adversely affect our stock price, our ability to raise capital or enter into strategic transactions, and our relationships with key stakeholders.In accordance with ASC Topic 205-40, Going Concern, the Company’s management evaluates whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This evaluation includes considerations related to the Company’s forecasted liquidity and cash consumption requirements for one year from the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in Note 17, Subsequent Events, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has, throughout 2025, announced certain financing and investment arrangements. While the 2025 actions discussed in Note 17, Subsequent Events demonstrate a series of material steps taken to improve the Company’s financial condition, the Company has a history of net losses and negative operating cash flows and expects to continue to incur additional losses in the near future. Although the Company continues to pursue a strategy to realize improved operations, including anticipated improvements from integration through the Marriott Agreement, the timing of realization cannot be guaranteed to ensure liquidity is available when needed to meet the Company’s obligations. As a result of these considerations, the Company’s liquidity may be insufficient to meet its obligations for at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements, which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.Management’s plans to address the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, as described above, include the following actions:•engaging a financial advisor to assist in identifying and securing strategic alternatives and financing arrangements,•continuing to focus on identifying and executing cost optimization initiatives;•continuing to execute our portfolio optimization program to mitigate losses related to certain underperforming properties and to assess the Company’s portfolio of rents relative to current operations and existing market rents; and•improving its financial performance through the potential to increase revenue by integrating with Marriott’s commercial engine and deliver costs savings.There can be no assurances of the Company’s ability to realize these plans. As a result, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements.There may be adverse impacts to the Company’s stock price, the Company’s ability to raise capital or enter into strategic transactions, or the Company’s relationship with its key stakeholders as a result of the uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern or the Company’s inability to successfully execute its substantial doubt mitigation plan. If we are unable to successfully execute our mitigation plan or obtain sufficient financial resources, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and we may be forced to terminate, significantly curtail or cease our operations or to pursue other strategic alternatives, including, but not limited to, commencing a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.45Table of ContentsWe have previously may again require additional capital to support business growth or respond to business challenges, and this capital might not be available in a timely manner or on favorable terms.We intend to continue investing in our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, as we have in the past, including the need to develop or add new properties or services or enhance our existing properties or services, enhance our operating infrastructure, invest in the effort to integrate our properties with Marriott’s systems under the Marriott Agreement, add personnel, and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds in the future, similar to recent financings that we’ve completed. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing could involve restrictive covenants relating to financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or strategic partnerships. Our outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock may also make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future due to certain rights provided to the holders Series A Preferred Stock, including such holders’ senior rights relative to rights of the holders of our common stock and such holders’ right to collectively purchase on a pro-rata basis up to 25% of any equity offering until August 13, 2029 at a purchase price equal to 75% of the purchase price of any other investor in such offering, each as described below. If we are unable to obtain adequate or satisfactory financing when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.Our indebtedness and credit facilities contain financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our financial and operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.The terms of certain of our indebtedness and credit facilities include a number of covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with other companies, sell or otherwise dispose of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock, make investments, loans and acquisitions, change the nature of our business or engage in transactions with affiliates. In addition, we must comply with a minimum EBITDA covenant to the extent we have not cash collateralized letters of credit issued by our senior lender, as well as maintain our common stock’s listing on Nasdaq, and beginning in 2027, comply with a minimum free cash flow covenant and a minimum liquidity covenant. We have added additional letters of credit issuance facilities and may seek additional or replacement credit arrangements, in part to support letters of credit or other security instruments for our leases of guest properties. Any future credit arrangements may have stricter covenants or other more onerous terms than our current arrangements. The terms of our indebtedness and credit facilities may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and to compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.Any failure to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreements has resulted and could again result in an event of default under the agreements, which, if not cured or waived, would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments to provide additional loans, declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable, increase the interest rates applicable to such debt, and exercise rights and remedies, including by way of initiating foreclosure proceedings against any assets constituting collateral for the obligations under the credit facilities. If our debt were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, such financing may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.Risks Related to Ownership of Our SecuritiesWe are not in compliance with Nasdaq’s requirements for continued listing of our securities, and if we fail to continue to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq, our common stock and Public Warrants may be delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and trading price of our common stock and warrants and on our ability to raise capital, and other adverse consequences.Our common stock and Public Warrants currently trade on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Nasdaq has requirements for our equity securities to remain listed on Nasdaq, including, among others, rules requiring timely filing of SEC reports, governance rules including requirements for stockholder approval of certain transactions, and a rule requiring our common stock to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. We have received notices from Nasdaq notifying us that, because we were delinquent in filing our required periodic reports with the SEC, we are not in compliance with Nasdaq 46Table of ContentsListing Rule 5250(c)(1). We submitted a plan to regain compliance and, although we are working diligently toward regaining compliance, no assurance can be given that we will file such reports within the time periods required by Nasdaq. If we fail to do so, we expect the Nasdaq staff to notify us that our securities will be delisted, and at that time, we expect to appeal that determination to a Nasdaq Hearing Panel. The outcome of any such Nasdaq process is inherently uncertain. There can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements in the future. If we fail to regain and maintain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements, our common stock and Public Warrants could be delisted from Nasdaq. If that occurs, the liquidity of our common stock and Public Warrants would be adversely affected, and their market prices could decrease. Delisting would also constitute an event of default under certain of our debt instruments and our other contractual obligations, which would require us to expend cash to repay debt or replace letters of credit or could subject us to breach of contract claims. It could cause other adverse consequences, such as difficulties in raising capital and in providing stock-based incentives to attract and retain personnel. Delisting could also impair our reputation and our relationships with real estate owners and other business partners, which could make it more difficult or costly for us to expand our portfolio of leased properties. In addition, our common stock could be deemed to be a “penny stock,” which could result in reduced levels of trading in our common stock, and we would also become subject to additional State securities regulations in connection with any sales of our securities.The market price and trading volume of our common stock and Public Warrants may be volatile and could decline significantly.The stock markets, including Nasdaq, have, from time to time, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. Even if an active, liquid, and orderly trading market develops and is sustained for our publicly-traded securities, the market price of our common stock and our Public Warrants may be volatile and could decline significantly. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock and warrants may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. The trading price of our common stock has experienced volatility and may continue to experience volatility. If the market price of our common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares or warrants at or above the market price at which you acquired them. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock or warrants will not fluctuate widely or decline significantly in the future in response to a number of factors, including, among others, the following:•The realization of any of the risk factors presented in this report;•Actual or anticipated differences or changes in our estimates, or in the estimates of analysts, for our revenues, Adjusted FCF, or other cash flow measures, results of operations, operating metrics, level of indebtedness, liquidity or financial condition;•Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;•Additions and departures of key personnel, including our recently announced transition of the Chief Executive Officer;•Failure to comply with the listing requirements of Nasdaq, or the disclosure of any notifications from Nasdaq about the listing status of our common stock;•Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other laws or regulations;•Future or anticipated issuances, sales, resales or repurchases of our securities, or any amendments or adjustments in their terms, including but not limited to the issuance and resale of additional shares of common stock upon conversion of our outstanding shares of Preferred Stock;•Publication of research reports about us or other publicity about us, our properties, or incidents at our properties;•The performance and market valuations of other similar companies;•Commencement of, or involvement in, litigation or other legal proceedings involving us;•Broad disruptions in the financial markets, including sudden disruptions in the credit markets;•Speculation in the press or investment community;•Actual, potential or perceived control, accounting or reporting problems;•Changes in accounting principles, policies, and guidelines; and•Other events or factors, including those resulting from infectious diseases, health epidemics and pandemics, natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism, cyberattacks, information security incidents, or responses to these events.In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their shares. We have been subject to securities class action litigation and could encounter substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on us.Our outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the holders thereof have certain special rights. Such rights, as well as similar or other rights that may accompany any future issuance of shares of preferred stock, may adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.47Table of ContentsOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, powers, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, as of July 7, 2025, we had 60,113,000 shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. The Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock. The Preferred Stock has, and any future senior securities we may issue may have, priority upon liquidation. The shares of Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of common stock, have no stated maturity, and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless converted into common stock. The Preferred Stock will be convertible at the holders’ option into common stock at an initial conversion price of the lower of (i) $1.00 and (ii) a ten percent (10%) discount to the lowest daily VWAP of the common stock on the principal trading market therefor in the seven trading days prior to the date of delivery of an Optional Conversion Notice (as defined in the Certificate of Designation (as defined below)); provided that the conversion price will not be less than $0.50, as adjusted for any stock dividends, splits, combinations or other similar events on the common stock or Preferred Stock. In addition, holders of the Preferred Stock are also entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board, cumulative dividends in cash (subject to certain conditions), at a rate of (a) fifteen percent (15.00%) through August 13, 2025, (b) ten percent (10.00%) from August 14, 2025 through August 13, 2027, and (c) five percent (5.00%) from August 14, 2027 through August 13, 2028 on the sum of (i) the liquidation preference per share of Preferred Stock and (ii) all accumulated and unpaid dividends (if any), payable quarterly, in arrears. Dividends accumulate on a daily basis from the most recent date as to which dividends have been paid, or, if no dividends have been paid, from the date of issuance of such shares of Preferred Stock (whether or not (i) any of the Company’s agreements prohibit the current payment of dividends, (ii) there shall be earnings or funds of the Company legally available for the payment of such dividends, or (iii) the Company declares the payment of dividends), until the earlier of: (x) the date that the Company publicly reports that it has realized at least $87 million of free cash flow (representing cash used in operating activities plus cash used in investing activities) over a twelve month period; or (y) August 13, 2028.The purchasers of the shares of our Preferred Stock also have certain contractual rights. For example, we are obliged to file a registration statement under the Securities Act within 30 calendar days of the filing of this Annual Report with respect to the resale of shares of common stock receivable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. The securities purchase agreements under which the shares of Preferred Stock were purchased give the purchasers thereunder the right to purchase up to 25% of any equity offering within the next five years. The rights of the Preferred Stock, as well as the rights we may provide in issuing shares of preferred stock in the future, may adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.We have issued, and may in the future issue, shares of common stock or other equity securities, which may depress the price of our common stock and other publicly traded securities.We have the following securities outstanding:•60,113,000 shares of Preferred Stock, which are currently convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share, subject to certain limitations and adjustments, and after giving effect to all potential in-kind dividend payments and assuming the lowest conversion price, may be convertible into up to 24,872,000 shares of common stock;•the Public Warrants, which are exercisable for an aggregate of 724,997 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $230.00 per share; and•other Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,521,281 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.24 per share.The exercise or conversion of such securities will dilute the ownership interests of our other stockholders, and this dilution could be material. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such exercises or conversions could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock and Public Warrants. In addition, the existence of such exercisable or convertible securities may encourage short selling by stock market participants, because the common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of such securities could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated exercises or conversions of such securities into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock48Table of ContentsThere is no guarantee that the Public Warrants will ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless.Our Public Warrants are exercisable on the basis of 20 Public Warrants for one share of common stock, at an exercise price of $230.00 per share. There is no guarantee that the Public Warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, the Public Warrants may expire worthless.We may amend the terms of the Public Warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 50.0% of the then-outstanding Public Warrants. Our Public Warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement with Computershare that provides that the terms of the Public Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision but requires the approval by the holders of at least 50.0% of the then-outstanding Public Warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the Public Warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50.0% of the then-outstanding Public Warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the Public Warrants with the consent of at least 50.0% of the then-outstanding Public Warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the Public Warrants, shorten the exercise period, or decrease the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a Public Warrant.We may redeem unexpired Public Warrants prior to their exercise at a time and at a price that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making their Public Warrants worthless, and an exercise of a significant number of warrants could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.We have the ability to redeem outstanding Public Warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant; provided that the last reported sales price of our Common Stock equals or exceeds $360.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we give proper notice of such redemption to the warrant holders and provided certain other conditions are met. If and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding Public Warrants could force the warrant holders: (i) to exercise their Public Warrants and pay the exercise price therefore at a time when it may be disadvantageous for them to do so; (ii) to sell their Public Warrants at the then-current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold their Public Warrants; or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding Public Warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of their Public Warrants. Additionally, if a significant number of Public Warrant holders exercise their Public Warrants instead of accepting the nominal redemption price, the issuance of these shares would dilute other equity holders, which could reduce the market price of our Common Stock. As of the date of this report, our Common Stock has never traded above $360.00 per share.In addition, we may redeem Public Warrants after they become exercisable for a number of shares of Common Stock determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our Common Stock, starting at a trading price of $200.00. Any such redemption may have similar consequences to a cash redemption described above. In addition, such redemption may occur at a time when the Public Warrants are “out-of-the-money,” in which case holders of Public Warrants would lose any potential embedded value from a subsequent increase in the value of the Common Stock had such holders’ Public Warrants remained outstanding.Provisions in the Amended and Restated Bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or with our directors, officers or employees and may discourage stockholders from bringing such claims. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the federal district court of the District of Delaware) will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for: •Any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;49Table of Contents•Any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, stockholders, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders;•Any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our Amended and Restated Bylaws; or•Any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. However, this provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, which provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts with respect to all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this exclusive forum provision will not apply to actions arising under the Securities Act, as other provisions in the Amended and Restated Bylaws designate the federal district courts of the United States as the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act against any person in connection with any offering of our securities. However, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provision. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of the Amended and Restated Bylaws. However, there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in the Amended and Restated Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 1C. CybersecurityRisk Management and StrategyOur business involves the collection, storage, transmission, and other processing of confidential and sensitive data, including information about our guests and employees, and our operations depend on various information technology systems, communications networks, and technology applications, including those of third parties, such as software-as-a-service providers. Accordingly, we face cybersecurity threats on an ongoing basis. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. For additional information regarding risks from cybersecurity threats, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have implemented, and continue to develop, various information security processes and measures designed to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. Depending on the context, our technical and operational measures include vulnerability and risk assessments, network security and access controls, encryption of relevant data, systems monitoring, and employee training. Our Information Security team refers to the National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework, among other industry reference sources, as a general guide in implementing security measures and addressing cybersecurity risks. On an ongoing basis, our senior management team considers cybersecurity risks among our other important enterprise-wide risks.We work with third parties from time to time to assist us in our cybersecurity efforts, including technology consulting firms and legal advisors, and on a periodic basis, an external vulnerability testing vendor with respect to certain Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requirements. Depending on the nature of the services provided, the information involved, and the identity of the service provider, our vendor management process may include reviewing the cybersecurity practices of such provider. We also participate in a “bug bounty” program that provides incentives for third-party researchers to identify possible system vulnerabilities. We also maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage. Our insurance coverage may not cover or fully insure all cybersecurity-related risks that we face, as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.50Table of ContentsGovernanceOur Board has ultimate oversight responsibility for the Company’s strategy and risk management, including material risks related to cybersecurity threats. The Board administers its risk oversight function directly and through the Audit Committee. Our executive officers are responsible for the day-to-day management of the material risks we face, including cybersecurity risks. Among other things, management is responsible for hiring appropriate personnel, designing and implementing cybersecurity-related processes, communicating priorities to relevant personnel, and assessing cybersecurity incidents as they arise. Among members of our senior management, cybersecurity matters are overseen by our Vice President, Technical Product Management, who reports to our Chief Executive Officer and has more than two decades of experience in product leadership, engineering, and information technology. Our Senior Director, Information Technology Compliance and Information Security (“Head of Information Security”) reports to our Vice President, Technical Product Manager, and leads our cybersecurity risk assessment, management, and response processes, including their implementation and maintenance. Before joining Sonder in January 2022, our Head of Information Security had approximately 18 years of additional experience as an information security officer and security consultant. He holds CISSP, CISM, and CDPSE certifications. Our cybersecurity incident response and vulnerability management processes are designed to escalate cybersecurity incidents to members of management, and if applicable, to our Board, depending on the circumstances. Our Head of Information Security also has monthly program updates with our Vice President, Technical Product Manager and other technology team members to discuss cybersecurity and other technology related initiatives, progress and status. Additional discussions and updates occur in preparation for quarterly Board meetings and on an ad hoc basis. The Board receives quarterly reports from management, concerning significant cybersecurity risks, assessments, and related matters. Management also updates our Audit Committee concerning cybersecurity matters from time to time.Item 2. PropertiesA substantial percentage of Sonder’s corporate staff, including senior management, works remotely. Sonder leases or licenses office space for corporate and administrative purposes at various locations from time to time, none of which is material to its operations. Sonder’s principal warehouse for furniture distribution in the United States and Canada is in Fort Worth, Texas at a facility owned by a third-party, where Sonder was utilizing approximately 170,000 square feet of storage space as of December 31, 2024, under a contract that expires on December 31, 2026 unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. Sonder also leases smaller warehouse and storage spaces to support various cities’ operations. Sonder believes that its existing facilities are adequate for its near-term needs, and that suitable alternative space would be available if required in the future on commercially reasonable terms.Item 3.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Sonder Holdings Inc. (“Sonder,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) should be read together with Sonder’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Sonder’s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Sonder’s historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. Except as otherwise noted, all references to 2024 refer to the year ended December 31, 2024, and references to 2023 refer to the year ended December 31, 2023.OverviewWe are a leading global brand of premium, design-forward apartments and intimate boutique hotels serving the modern traveler. Launched in 2014, Sonder offers inspiring, thoughtfully designed accommodations and innovative, tech-enabled service combined into one seamless experience. Sonder properties are found in prime locations in 41 cities, spanning nine countries and three continents. The Sonder app gives guests control over their stay. Complete with self-service features, simple check-in and 24/7 on-the-ground support, Sonder’s amenities and services at Sonder are just a tap away, making a world of better stays open to all. In August 2024, we announced a strategic licensing agreement with Marriott and completed the full integration with Marriott’s digital channels and platform in the second quarter of 2025. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 9,900 units available for guests to book at 195 properties.Sonder’s Business ModelWe work directly with real estate owners to lease properties that meet our standards and furnish and decorate the properties to provide a design-led, technology-enabled experience, and then make them available for guests to book through direct channels (i.e., the Sonder app, our website, or our sales personnel) or through indirect channels, such as Airbnb, Expedia, Booking.com, and other OTAs. Our design-focused accommodations come in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate our guests – from a multiple-bedroom apartment with a fully-equipped kitchen and private laundry facilities, to a hotel room or suite. Our diverse product portfolio serves various traveler types, including leisure travelers, families, digital nomads, and business travelers. We manage our properties using proprietary and third-party technologies and deliver services to guests via the Sonder app and 24/7 on-the-ground support.We currently lease all of our properties. In many of our leases, we have negotiated an upfront allowance paid by the real estate owner to help offset the capital invested to prepare and furnish a building and the individual units. In August 2024, we entered into the Marriott Agreement. We completed the full Marriott integration in the second quarter of 2025. As of June 2025, all Sonder properties are available for booking on Marriott’s digital channels, including Marriott.com and the Marriott Bonvoy® mobile app under the new “Sonder by Marriott Bonvoy” collection, and are expected to benefit from access to Marriott’s global sales organization and third-party agreements. Our properties will also continue participating in the Marriott Bonvoy® travel platform, which began in October 2024 after the first phase of integration was complete.Recent DevelopmentsThe following summary of certain events and developments subsequent to December 31, 2024 should be read in conjunction with the additional information contained elsewhere in this report, including the information in Note 17. Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Securities Purchase AgreementsOn April 11, 2025, we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (the “April 2025 Securities Purchase Agreements”) whereby we issued and sold an aggregate of 17.98 million shares (the “Preferred Shares”) of Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of $1.00 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $17.98 million (the “April 2025 Preferred Financing”). The terms of the Preferred Shares are identical to the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.53Table of ContentsConsent, Waiver and Sixth Amendment to Note and Warrant Purchase AgreementOn April 11, 2025, we entered into the Waiver, Consent and Sixth Amendment (the “NPA Amendment”), which modifies the Note Purchase Agreement. Among other things, the NPA Amendment provides for (a) certain waivers in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the April 2025 Securities Purchase Agreements, (b) the cancellation of an amount equal to 15% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) and accrued but unpaid interest on the Notes as of the amendment date, (c) a reduction in the interest rate applicable to the Notes, (d) an extension of the option to pay interest in kind and (e) amendments to certain covenants under the Note Purchase Agreement.In connection with the Company’s entrance into the NPA Amendment, the Company issued warrants to the investors to purchase an aggregate of up to 5 million shares of common Stock at $1.00 per share (collectively, the “NPA Warrants”).Consent, Waiver and Sixth Amendment to 2022 Loan and Security AgreementOn April 11, 2025, we entered into the Consent, Waiver and Sixth Amendment (the “SVB Amendment”), which modifies that certain Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2022 (the “2022 Loan and Security Agreement”). Among other things, the SVB Amendment provides for (a) certain waivers in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the April 2025 Securities Purchase Agreements, (b) the reduction of the revolving line of credit from $60.0 million to $35.0 million and the reduction of the letter of credit sublimit from $45.0 million to $35.0 million, and (c) amendments to certain of the covenants under the 2022 Loan and Security Agreement.Marriott License AgreementOn April 11, 2025, the Company received the remaining $7.5 million, completing the $15.0 million investment under the Marriott Agreement (the “Key Money”).Lawsuit SettlementsOn July 24, 2024, the Company favorably settled two lawsuits related to certain property leases for a total of $7.5 million payable in three tranches. The Company received the first tranche of $2.5 million in July 2024, the second tranche of $2.3 million in November 2024, and the third tranche of $2.7 million in January 2025. The Company recognized the settlement income when it was realized and earned accordingly in the periods of payment receipt.Management Discussion Regarding Opportunities, Challenges, and RisksCash Flow Positive PlanA primary focus is to put the business on a solid path to achieving sustainable positive Adjusted FCF as soon as possible (the “Cash Flow Positive Plan”). Adjusted FCF is a non-GAAP measure. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is cash used in operating activities, which was $(129.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $(110.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We have continued to make progress toward this goal as our Adjusted FCF of $(89.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a $30.1 million improvement compared to Adjusted FCF of $(119.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2023.As part of our efforts to reach positive Adjusted FCF, we implemented a portfolio optimization program in November 2023 to mitigate losses related to certain underperforming properties and to assess our portfolio of rents relative to current operations and existing market rents. As of December 31, 2024, we have signed agreements to exit or reduce rent at approximately 110 buildings, or 4,500 units, as part of our portfolio optimization program. Of the approximately 85 buildings, or 3,300 units, with finalized exit agreements, we had exited approximately 80 buildings, or 3,200 units, as of December 31, 2024. As of June 30, 2025, all 85 buildings, or 3,300 units with finalized exit agreements were exited.Additionally, we anticipate that the Marriott Agreement will deliver significant revenue opportunities and operating efficiencies for Sonder. Following full integration with Marriott’s extensive global sales and marketing capabilities, as well as with Marriott’s loyalty platform and distribution and booking channels, we expect these sources of new and improved demand to drive substantial uplift in RevPAR over time. We also expect to realize substantial customer acquisition cost savings through improved distribution channel mix and preferred distribution channel rates. In April 2025, we announced 54Table of Contentsthat we are implementing cost reduction initiatives which, when complete, are expected to deliver approximately $50 million of annualized cost savings compared to the third quarter of 2024. The savings are anticipated to come from a combination of headcount reductions, software savings, and other efficiencies in conjunction with the Marriott integration.Our ability to reach our Adjusted FCF goal is subject to certain risks, including potential changes in travel demand due to macroeconomic factors or other developments affecting our industry, uncertainties associated with the timing and scope of new property openings, uncertainties associated with the portfolio optimization program described above, our ability to achieve other intended cost reductions and efficiencies, our strategic licensing agreement with Marriott, and the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K including under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.Supply GrowthA key driver of our revenue growth is our ability to convert Contracted Units into Live Units and, to a lesser extent, to continue signing properties with favorable terms. Certain signed leases have contingencies or conditions that we or the landlord must satisfy before we lease the units, and from time to time, we exclude some of these leases from our Contracted Units total based on our judgment about the likelihood that the contingencies or conditions will be satisfied.As part of our Cash Flow Positive Plan, we slowed our planned pace of new unit signings to focus on growth primarily through the conversion of our Contracted Units into Live Units. Additionally, we implemented a portfolio optimization program to mitigate losses related to certain underperforming properties in November 2023, which has resulted in exiting certain Live Units during 2024. We have also defaulted or expect to default on certain lease agreements due to the non-payment of rent. While we intend to cure any current or future defaults to avoid loss of profitable properties, material monetary damages and future litigation, liquidity constraints may prevent us from doing so. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Live Units grew on a gross basis due to the conversion of Contracted Units into Live Units. However, this growth was offset by the exit of certain units as part of the portfolio optimization program. As such, Live Units decreased 19% from December 31, 2023 to approximately 9,900 units as of December 31, 2024.We are also focused on targeting 100% capital light deals (as defined in the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below) for incremental unit signings. While we continue to sign capital light properties, development cost uncertainty and augmented risk around financing and landlord sentiment surrounding our stock price performance began to slow the pace of signings starting in the second half of 2022. These factors were more acute in 2023 and 2024, resulting in fewer units signed in these periods than in prior years. Ability to Attract and Retain GuestsAnother key driver of our revenue growth is our ability to bring back repeat guests and to attract new guests through various channels. We source demand from a variety of channels, including directly through Sonder.com, the Sonder app, or our sales personnel, and indirectly through OTAs, such as Airbnb, Expedia, and Booking.com. While bookings made through OTAs incur channel transaction fees, they allow us to attract new guests who may not be familiar with the Sonder brand. In general, direct bookings are more advantageous to us as they do not incur channel transaction fees and also allow us to have a more direct relationship with our guests. Direct revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 45.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024. Additionally, we continue to focus on expanding our corporate sales business.To a lesser extent, we also sourced demand from the Marriott Bonvoy® travel platform during the year ended December 31, 2024. During the period from October 2024 through the completion of the full Marriott integration, Marriott Bonvoy members have early access to earn and redeem Marriott Bonvoy points when booking directly on Sonder.com, and Sonder properties are featured on Marriott.com with links to Sonder.com for booking. Revenue earned through this method is captured in the direct total revenue reported above.We completed the full Marriott integration in the second quarter of 2025. As of June 2025, all Sonder properties are available for booking on Marriott’s digital channels, including Marriott.com and the Marriott Bonvoy® mobile app under the new “Sonder by Marriott Bonvoy” collection. The Marriott Agreement provides us with access to Marriott’s global sales organization and third-party agreements. Our properties will also continue participating in the Marriott Bonvoy® travel platform.Technology55Table of ContentsTechnology is essential to our guest experience, as it leads guests through their entire Sonder stay, from booking through check-out. Technology also underpins our hospitality operations, including demand generation, revenue management, day-to-day operations, and more. By leveraging technology, our goal is to reduce operating costs and provide a better guest experience at a compelling value. The full Marriott integration, which was completed in the second quarter of 2025, is expected to complement Sonder's existing technology. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in our technology infrastructure and in integrating our properties and systems into Marriott's platform and systems.Restructuring In March 2023, we completed a reduction in force with $2.1 million in associated one-time restructuring costs, all of which were paid out in the year ended December 31, 2023. In February 2024, we completed a reduction in force with approximately $3.0 million in associated one-time restructuring costs, all of which were paid out in the year ended December 31, 2024.In April 2025, we completed a reduction in force with approximately $2.8 million in associated one-time restructuring costs, all of which are expected to be paid out in the year ended December 31, 2025.Key Business Metrics We track the following key business metrics to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Accordingly, we believe these key business metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. These key business metrics may be different from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies. The following table provides the key metrics (rounded):Year ended December 31,Change20242023No.%Live Units (End of Period)9,900 12,200 (2,300)(18.9)%Bookable Nights3,911,000 3,995,000 (84,000)(2.1)%Occupied Nights3,165,000 3,273,000 (108,000)(3.3)%Total Portfolio(1)10,700 16,000 (5,300)(33.1)%RevPAR$159 $151 $8 5.3 %ADR$196 $184 $12 6.5 %Occupancy Rate80.9 %82.0 %(1.1)%(1.3)%(1)Total Portfolio consists of Live Units and Contracted Units at the end of the period noted. Live UnitsLive Units generate Bookable Nights (as defined below) which generate revenue. Live Units are a key driver of revenue, and a key measure of the scale of our business, which in turn drives our financial performance. Growth in Live Units is driven by the number of units contracted in prior periods, and the lead time and opening period associated with making those units available to guests. The time from contract signing to building opening varies widely, ranging from relatively short periods for hotels that already meet our brand standards and/or that are already live hotels operating under another brand, to many months or even years for projects under renovation or construction. The number of Live Units at the end of a period is also affected by the number of Live Units that were exited (i.e. no longer available for guest stays) during that same period. Sonder exits Live Units from time to time for a variety of reasons, including to mitigate losses related to certain underperforming properties, such as in connection with the portfolio optimization program.56Table of ContentsDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Live Units grew on a gross basis due to the conversion of Contracted Units into Live Units. However, this growth was offset by the exit of certain units as part of the portfolio optimization program. As such, Live Units decreased 19% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 to approximately 9,900 units. As of December 31, 2024, our five largest cities (New York City, Dubai, Montreal, Miami, and London) accounted for approximately 37% of our Live Units, and our 10 largest cities accounted for approximately 60% of our Live Units. As of December 31, 2023, our five largest cities (New York City, Mexico City, Dubai, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia) accounted for approximately 35% of our Live Units, and our 10 largest cities accounted for approximately 57% of our Live Units.Bookable Nights / Occupied NightsBookable Nights represent the total number of nights available for stays across all Live Units. Occupied Nights represent the total number of nights occupied across all Live Units. Occupancy Rate (“OR”) is calculated as Occupied Nights divided by Bookable Nights. Bookable Nights, Occupied Nights, and OR are key drivers of revenue, which in turn drives financial performance. The decrease in Bookable Nights and Occupied Nights year-over-year was driven by the portfolio optimization program and the resulting year-over-year decrease in Live Units.RevPAR and Average Daily RateRevPAR represents the average revenue earned per available room and can be calculated either by dividing revenue by Bookable Nights, or by multiplying ADR by OR. ADR represents the average revenue earned per night occupied and is calculated as revenue divided by Occupied Nights. RevPAR and ADR are key drivers of revenue, and key measures of our ability to attract and retain guests, which in turn drives financial performance. Several factors may explain period-to-period RevPAR variances, including: •Live Units that became live in recent months and have not yet reached mature economics. Typically, new Live Units take twelve months to achieve mature ADR and OR as buildings stabilize and drive organic bookings. If a period has a significant increase in Live Units, this may adversely impact total RevPAR. •Market mix represents the composition of our portfolio based on geographic presence. Certain markets such as New York or London typically earn higher RevPARs, while certain other markets such as Houston or Phoenix typically earn lower RevPARs. Therefore, if the market mix shifts toward lower RevPAR markets, it may adversely impact total RevPAR. •Product mix represents the composition of our portfolio between apartment and hotel style units. In general, apartment style units typically earn higher RevPARs because they typically offer more amenities (e.g., kitchen, in-unit washer/dryer) and have higher square footage compared to hotel style units. Therefore, if the product mix shifts towards hotel style units, it may reduce the average portfolio-wide RevPAR.•Seasonality drives typical period-to-period variances in a particular property’s RevPAR depending upon seasonal factors (e.g., weather patterns, local attractions and events, holidays) as well as property location and type. Total RevPAR tends to be lower in the first quarter and fourth quarter of each year due to seasonal factors such as weather and holidays and the market mix and product mix of our live properties at the time. However, the effect of seasonality could vary as our market mix and product mix continues to evolve.The increases in RevPAR for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 were primarily driven by the impact of the portfolio optimization program and broader travel industry trends.57Table of ContentsResults of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of revenue (in thousands, except percentages):Year ended December 31,20242023Revenue$621,272 100.0 %$602,066 100.0 %Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)377,243 60.7 %392,898 65.3 %Operations and support184,343 29.7 %212,913 35.4 %General and administrative123,390 19.9 %112,082 18.6 %Research and development16,522 2.7 %22,365 3.7 %Sales and marketing84,248 13.6 %78,566 13.0 %Impairment losses13,164 2.1 %59,165 9.8 %Integration costs1,066 0.2 %— — %Restructuring and other charges3,913 0.6 %2,119 0.4 %Total costs and operating expenses803,889 129.4 %880,108 146.2 %Loss from operations(182,617)(29.4)%(278,042)(46.2)%Total non-operating expense, net43,476 7.0 %18,559 3.1 %Loss before income taxes(226,093)(36.4)%(296,601)(49.3)%Benefit for income taxes(2,006)(0.3)%(933)(0.2)%Net loss$(224,087)(36.1)%$(295,668)(49.1)%Other comprehensive loss:Change in foreign currency translation adjustment2,384 0.4 %(8,050)(1.3)%Comprehensive loss$(221,703)(35.7)%$(303,718)(50.4)%RevenueThe Company generates revenues primarily by providing accommodations to its guests. Direct revenue is generated from stays booked through Sonder.com, the Sonder app, or directly with our sales personnel, while indirect revenue is generated from stays booked through OTAs.The following table sets forth our revenue (in thousands, except percentages):Year ended December 31,Change20242023$%Revenue$621,272 $602,066 $19,206 3.2 %Revenue increased, primarily due to a 5.3% increase in RevPAR partially offset by a 2.1% decrease in Bookable Nights. The increase in RevPAR was primarily driven by the portfolio optimization program and broader travel industry trends. The decrease in Bookable Nights is the result of Live Units exited from the portfolio optimization program.58Table of ContentsCosts and Operating ExpensesThe following table sets forth our total costs and operating expenses (in thousands, except percentages):Year ended December 31,Change20242023$%Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)$377,243 $392,898 $(15,655)(4.0)%Operations and support184,343 212,913 (28,570)(13.4)%General and administrative123,390 112,082 11,308 10.1 %Research and development16,522 22,365 (5,843)(26.1)%Sales and marketing84,248 78,566 5,682 7.2 %Impairment losses13,164 59,165 (46,001)(77.8)%Integration costs1,066 — 1,066 100.0 %Restructuring and other charges3,913 2,119 1,794 84.7 %Total costs and operating expenses$803,889 $880,108 $(76,219)(8.7)%Cost of Revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization): Cost of revenue expenses primarily consists of lease costs to real estate owners for our Live Units, cleaning costs, and payment processing charges. We expect our cost of revenue will continue to fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, in line with the change in Bookable Nights in connection with the portfolio optimization program. Cost of revenue may vary as a percentage of revenue from period-to-period based on the timing and seasonality of bookings. Additionally, our cost of revenue does not necessarily increase at a rate commensurate with the increase in revenue, given that drivers of increases in revenue, such as increases in ADR, do not necessarily require additional costs.Cost of revenue decreased, primarily due to: a $19.0 million decrease in rent expense due to the decrease in Live Units driven by the portfolio optimization program, partially offset by (a) a $2.2 million increase in cleaning expenses as a result of an increase in the number of checkouts due to shorter stays, and (b) a $1.3 million increase in other cost of revenue expenses.Operations and support: Operations and support expenses are related to guest-facing functions and variable expenses associated with property-level operations, such as customer service and hospitality, depreciation of property and equipment, utilities, costs to open new properties, and the cost of guest-room consumable items and low-cost furnishings. Operations and support decreased, primarily due to: (i) a $13.3 million decrease in unit-related expenses mostly related to smaller non-capitalized items for our units such as bedding, decor, furniture, and lighting, driven mainly by the decrease in Live Units, (ii) an $8.6 million decrease in employee compensation cost due to a decrease in average headcount, (iii) a $2.0 million decrease in legal and professional fees, (iv) a $3.6 million decrease in location acquisition costs due to the timing of costs related to onboarding new units, and (v) a $2.4 million decrease in depreciation expense, partially offset by the cumulative impact of other less significant expense increases.General and administrative: General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses for administrative functions, such as legal, finance, accounting, public policy, and human resources. It also includes certain professional services fees, technology expenses, bad debt expense, general corporate and director and officer insurance, and other corporate-level expenses we incur to manage and support our operations. We expect to continue to incur certain general and administrative costs as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, as well as expenses for corporate insurance, director and officer insurance, investor relations, and professional services. General and administrative increased, primarily due to: (i) a $27.0 million increase in legal and professional expenses related to corporate matters, which includes legal and professional fees associated with the formation of the strategic licensing agreement with Marriott and financing deals, all announced in August 2024, (ii) a $13.0 million increase in taxes primarily related to value added taxes, (iii) a $8.1 million increase in bad debt expense due to additional reserves on corporate and group bookings. General and administrative expenses were partially offset by (iv) a $27.8 million decrease in employee compensation cost due to a decrease in average headcount, (v) a $3.4 million decrease in insurance facilities 59Table of Contentsexpense related to a reduction on office space, and (vi) additional less significant decreases in facilities, depreciation, and other. Research and development: Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses and an allocation of our facility expenses incurred in connection with the development of our existing and new services. Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of existing services, and on integrating our properties and systems into Marriott’s platform and systems. We capitalize the portion of our software development costs that meets the criteria for capitalization. Research and development decreased, primarily due to: (i) a net $2.8 million decrease in employee compensation driven by a decrease in average headcount, (ii) a $1.6 million decrease in depreciation, primarily due to a decrease in capitalized software costs, (iii) a $0.9 million decrease in computer software expense, and (iv) a $0.4 million decrease in legal and professional fees. Sales and marketing: Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of service charges for bookings made through OTAs, personnel-related expenses for sales, marketing, advertising costs, and branding. Sales and marketing increased, primarily due to (i) a $3.6 million increase in performance marketing expense, (ii) a $1.5 million increase in channel transaction fees resulting from an increase in revenue booked through OTAs, consistent with total revenue growth, and (iii) a $1.5 million increase in employee compensation due to growth in our corporate sales team.Impairment losses: Impairment loss charges include impairment of long-lived assets.Impairment losses decreased, primarily due to improved valuation variables related to the valuation of our operating lease ROU assets, that triggered an impairment charge recognized by the Company in the corresponding prior period.Integration costs: For the year ended December 31, 2024, the integration costs consisted of costs associated with the Marriott Agreement as they pertain to integration related items, such as legal fees and other organizational related costs. For the year ended December 31, 2023, there were no associated integration costs.Restructuring and other charges: For the year ended December 31, 2024, the restructuring and other charges consisted of employee termination benefits as a result of a restructuring announced on February 20, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2023, restructuring and other charges consisted primarily of employee termination benefits as a result of the restructuring announced on March 1, 2023. The entirety of the increase in restructuring and other charges was due to the difference in amounts recognized for each of the restructurings discussed above.Total Non-Operating Expense, NetTotal non-operating expense, net consists primarily of lease adjustment (gains), net, loss on preferred stock issuance, the change in fair value of forward contract, Earn Out Liability, SPAC Warrants, and other instruments carried at fair value, realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and balances, and interest expense related to the term loans and convertible debt.The following table sets forth our total non-operating expense, net (in thousands, except percentages):Year ended December 31,Change20242023$%Interest expense, net$34,213 $25,409 $8,804 34.6 %Change in fair value of SPAC Warrants(87)(615)528 (85.9)%Change in fair value of Earn Out Liability(30)(2,372)2,342 (98.7)%Lease adjustment (gains), net(93,175)(10,145)(83,030)818.4 %Loss on preferred stock issuance83,812 — 83,812 (100.0)%Change in fair value of forward contract28,652 — 28,652 (100.0)%Other expense (income), net(9,909)6,282 (16,191)(257.7)%Total non-operating expense, net$43,476 $18,559 $24,917 134.3 %60Table of ContentsInterest expense, net: Interest expense, net increased primarily due to interest expense recognized on the Company’s Delayed Draw Notes.Change in fair value of SPAC Warrants. The change in the fair value of this line item resulted primarily from a decrease in our stock price period-over-period.Change in fair value of Earn Out Liability. The change in the fair value of this line item resulted from a decrease in our stock price period-over-period.Lease adjustment gains, net. The lease adjustment gains, net is due to the residual impact of lease terminations. The Company undertook the portfolio optimization program to renegotiate or exit certain properties with unfavorable lease terms.Loss on preferred stock issuance. The loss on preferred stock issuance of $83.8 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024, attributable to the Securities Purchase Agreements (the “August 2024 Security Purchase Agreements”) entered into by the Company on August 13, 2024, (the “August 2024 Preferred Financing”). The transaction provided for 43.3 million newly issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in exchange for cash consideration in an aggregate amount of approximately $43.3 million. The shares were valued in excess of the proceeds received as part of the transaction. The Company identified the following two freestanding financial instruments issued in connection with the transaction; (a) Mezzanine equity-classified Series A Preferred Stock and (b) Liability-classified forward contract for commitments of investors to purchase, and commitments of the Company to sell additional Series A Preferred Stock. As of the transaction inception, these instruments had an aggregate fair value of $98.5 million and the Company received $14.7 million from the first tranche closing, resulting in the $83.8 million loss on preferred stock issuance. The loss on preferred stock issuance for the year ended December 31, 2024 consists of $82.5 million related to the two freestanding financial instruments discussed above, as well as $1.3 million associated with the recognition of the Preferred Stock Participation Rights, as discussed below. No similar loss was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023, as no issuance of this nature occurred.The August 2024 Securities Purchase Agreements also grant the August 2024 Purchasers (as defined below) the right to purchase up to 25% of any equity offering within the next five years (a “Subsequent Financing”). The August 2024 Purchasers are entitled to participate on a pro-rata basis (determined by their proportionate participation in the August 2024 Preferred Financing) at a purchase price equal to 75% of the purchase price of any other investor in such Subsequent Financing. The Company recognized a liability for this preferred stock participation right of $1.3 million within other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets on August 13, 2024. The Company recognized a change in fair value of the participation right of $7 thousand as the remeasurement reflecting fluctuations in the underlying variables and assumptions from inception on August 13, 2024 through the year ended December 31, 2024.Change in fair value of forward contracts. As part of the August 2024 Securities Purchase Agreements, the transaction included a Liability-classified forward contract for commitments of investors to purchase, and commitments of the Company to sell additional Series A Preferred Stock. The change in fair value of the forward contract of $28.7 million represents the remeasurement reflecting fluctuations in the underlying variables and assumptions from inception on August 13, 2024 through the year ended December 31, 2024. No similar change in fair value of forward contract was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023, as no issuance of this nature occurred.Other expense (income), net. The change in other expense (income), net is primarily due to the decrease of a 2023 loss contingency, the addition of 2024 other income from lease terminations and fluctuations in foreign currency rates which impacted the remeasurement of foreign balances to reporting currency.Provision for income taxesAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, except for Canada, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to our history of losses.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States.We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured as the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. 61Table of ContentsChanges in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.The following table sets forth the provision for income taxes (in thousands, except percentages):Year ended December 31,Change20242023$%Benefit for income taxes$(2,006)$(933)$(1,073)115.0 %The Benefit for income taxes change is primarily due to taxes related to operations in foreign jurisdictions. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP” or “U.S. GAAP”). However, some of the financial measures discussed herein are non-GAAP financial measures. In accordance with SEC rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), balance sheets, or statements of cash flows.To supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted FCF, Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, and Operating Lease Related Rent Charges (“Adjusted EBITDAR”) (collectively, the “non-GAAP financial measures”). We may periodically review and update our non-GAAP financial measures based on our determination of their relevance to our business which could result in the addition or elimination of select non-GAAP financial measures in the future.Adjusted Free Cash FlowThe following table presents the calculation of Adjusted FCF (in thousands):Year ended December 31,20242023Cash used in operating activities$(129,222)$(110,904)Cash provided by (used in) investing activities5,729(12,362)FCF, including cash received from Key Money investment and cash paid for lease terminations, restructuring, and professional fees(123,493)(123,266)Cash received from Key Money investment(7,500)—Cash paid for lease termination costs14,4991,343Cash paid for restructuring costs4,3632,322Cash paid for non-recurring professional fees22,566—Cash paid for integration costs52—Adjusted FCF$(89,513)$(119,601)We define Adjusted FCF as cash used in operating activities plus cash provided by (used in) investing activities, excluding the impact of the Key Money investment, lease terminations, restructuring, and non-recurring professional fee charges related to non-operational activities. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are cash used in operating activities when combined with cash provided by (used in) investing activities. Our near-term focus is to reach sustainable positive Adjusted FCF as described in our Cash Flow Positive Plan.We believe Adjusted FCF is meaningful to investors as it is the primary liquidity measure that we focus on internally to evaluate our progress towards the objectives outlined in our Cash Flow Positive Plan. We believe that achieving our goals around this measure will put us on a path to financial sustainability and will help fund our future growth.62Table of ContentsOur Adjusted FCF measure may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of these measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure may not provide a complete understanding of our cash flow as a whole. As such, these measures should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP cash flow.The change in Adjusted FCF period-over-period represented a 25.2% increase, primarily driven by a $19.5 million improvement in cash used in operating activities excluding cash paid for one-time items (lease termination costs, restructuring costs, non-recurring professional fees and integration costs) due to improved property profitability from the portfolio optimization program and other cost savings measures. The increase in Adjusted FCF was also driven by a $10.6 million improvement in cash used in investment activities excluding Key Money, due to lower capital expenditures in line with fewer takeovers during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.Refer to the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash Flow Information” below for further discussion surrounding the changes in our cash flow figures period-over-period.

The exclusion of these items and other similar items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. The indicated other items excluded are as follows:Stock-based Compensation Expense. Non-cash, stock-based compensation expense relates to our equity plan. We exclude such expense when assessing the effectiveness of our operating performance since stock-based compensation does not necessarily correlate with the underlying operating performance of the business.Lease adjustment gains, net. These net gains reflect the impact of lease terminations and modifications.Impairment loss.

One-time and/or non-recurring integration costs associated with the Marriott Agreement.We believe Adjusted EBITDA is meaningful to investors as it is the primary operating performance measure that we focus on internally to evaluate our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides a consistent basis for comparison across reporting periods by excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain one-time, non-recurring or non-operational items, such as lease adjustment gains, net, restructuring and other related charges, and professional fees related to discrete projects such as fees associated with the integration in connection with the strategic licensing agreement with Marriott and restatement activities. It serves as a key measure for us to align the Company financial performance with our internal financial planning and analysis. The change in Adjusted EBITDA period-over-period represented a 37.7% improvement, primarily driven by improved property profitability from the portfolio optimization program and other cost savings measures.Adjusted EBITDARThe following table presents the calculation of Adjusted EBITDAR (in thousands):Year ended December 31,20242023Adjusted EBITDA$(105,483)$(169,412)Operating lease related rent charges301,578 320,252 Adjusted EBITDAR$196,095 $150,840 We define Adjusted EBITDAR as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for operating lease related rent charges. We believe Adjusted EBITDAR is meaningful to investors as it is an operating performance measure that further enables us to assess our operating performance independent of operating leases, offering insights into our cash flow and performance.We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors by providing a clearer view of our core operations and allowing better comparability with other companies.The change in Adjusted EBITDAR period-over-period represented a 30.0% improvement, primarily driven by improved property profitability from the portfolio optimization program and other cost savings measures.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGoing Concern ConsiderationsIn accordance with ASC Topic 205-40, Going Concern, the Company’s management evaluates whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This evaluation includes considerations related to the Company’s forecasted liquidity and cash consumption requirements for one year from the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in Note 17, Subsequent Events, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has, throughout 2025, announced certain financing and investment arrangements. While the 2025 64Table of Contentsactions discussed in Note 17, Subsequent Events demonstrate a series of material steps taken to improve the Company’s financial condition, the Company has a history of net losses and negative operating cash flows and expects to continue to incur additional losses in the near future. Although the Company continues to pursue a strategy to realize improved operations, including anticipated improvements from integration through the Marriott Agreement, the timing of realization cannot be guaranteed to ensure liquidity is available when needed to meet the Company’s obligations. As a result of these considerations, the Company’s liquidity may be insufficient to meet its obligations for at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements, which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.Management’s plans to address the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, as described above, include the following actions:•engaging a financial advisor to assist in identifying and securing strategic alternatives and financing arrangements,•continuing to focus on identifying and executing cost optimization initiatives;•continuing to execute our portfolio optimization program to mitigate losses related to certain underperforming properties and to assess the Company’s portfolio of rents relative to current operations and existing market rents; and•improving its financial performance through the potential to increase revenue by integrating with Marriott’s commercial engine and deliver costs savings.There can be no assurances of the Company’s ability to realize these plans. As a result, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements.Sources and Uses of CashAt December 31, 2024, we had a cash balance, not including restricted cash, of $20.8 million, which was held for working capital purposes. Cash consists of checking and interest-bearing accounts. Reaching sustainable positive Adjusted FCF is a primary focus in the near-term, as detailed in our Cash Flow Positive Plan. Once we reach sustainable positive Adjusted FCF, we expect cash from operations will provide our principal source of liquidity. We generate cash from transactions with customers booking directly through Sonder.com and the Sonder app, which are settled through a payment processor, from transactions with third-party corporate customers which are settled based on contractual terms, and indirectly through OTAs, which are also settled based on contractual terms. The most significant source of cash in 2024 was cash inflows from both current period and future guest bookings, in addition to funds received related to the August 2024 Preferred Financing.We have incurred losses since inception, and we expect to continue to incur additional losses in the future. Our operations to date have been financed primarily by private equity investments in our common stock and convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, and other note and warrant purchase agreements, as described in Note 7, Debt, and Note 17 Subsequent Events, in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that our existing cash on hand combined with our anticipated estimated Adjusted FCF may be insufficient to fund our operations and debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our management has concluded there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, which is not alleviated, for one year from the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the successful execution of any future financing arrangements, our rate of RevPAR growth, our ability to achieve cost efficiencies, our ability to provide security instruments such as letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits pursuant to leases, and the extent of real estate owners’ funding of capital expenditures and other pre-opening costs at our leased properties. To the extent that our existing cash balance and ongoing cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing, including convertible debt, short-term bridge financing, or otherwise, but such funds may not be available on acceptable terms. If sufficient cash from operations or external funding is not available, we may be unable to adequately fund our business plans and it could have a negative effect on our business, operating cash flows, financial condition, and cash flows. Most of our cash was held in the United States as of December 31, 2024. Our foreign subsidiaries held $4.0 million of cash in foreign jurisdictions. We currently do not intend or foresee a need to repatriate these foreign funds. As a result of the Tax 65Table of ContentsCuts and Jobs Act of 2017, however, we anticipate the U.S. federal tax impact to be minimal if these foreign funds are repatriated and would not repatriate funds where there was a material tax cost. Debt Arrangements Debt arrangements, such as our credit facilities and Delayed Draw Notes, have been a source of cash for our day-to-day operations. Refer to Note 7, Debt and Note 17, Subsequent Events, in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of our debt arrangements, including the timing of expected maturity of such arrangements. These arrangements include our $35.0 million loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”), now a division of First Citizens Bank & Trust Company dated as of December 21, 2022 (the “2022 Loan and Security Agreement”). In November 2023, this facility was amended which reduced the letter of credit sublimit from $60.0 million to $45.0 million. As of December 31, 2024, for so long as we are unable to satisfy a minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA covenant, we are required to cash collateralize our obligations under the 2022 Loan and Security Agreement. In April 2025, the SVB Amendment (as defined below) reduced the revolving line of credit from $60.0 million to $35.0 million and reduced the letter of credit sublimit from $45.0 million to $35.0 million.Future Cash Obligations Our estimated future obligations as of December 31, 2024 include both current and long-term obligations. Our debt obligations, including both capitalized to-date and future paid-in-kind interest through the election date of June 2024, totaled $313.0 million as of December 31, 2024, of which $1.0 million was short-term and the remainder was long-term. Interest on the foregoing debt obligations is payable in cash after the expiration of the Company’s ability to elect paid-in-kind interest, which has been extended through December 31, 2026. Additionally, we had $48.3 million of irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding which were collateralized by our restricted cash, all of which represents a long term cash obligation. Under our operating leases as discussed in Note 9, Leases, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we had a current obligation, before imputed interest, of $272.7 million and a long-term obligation, before imputed interest, of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2024. Operating lease obligations primarily represent the initial contracted term for leases that have commenced as of December 31, 2024, not including any future optional renewal periods. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with short-term future lease payments and long-term future lease payments totaling $625.2 million, excluding purchase options, that are not yet recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in the figure above. These leases are expected to commence between 2025 and 2026, with lease terms of five to 20 years. Certain leases do not have a scheduled commencement date, as they are currently subject to renegotiation.The Company has undertaken a portfolio optimization program, which involves discussions with landlords about renegotiating the terms of leases primarily at certain underperforming properties. This process has resulted in and may continue to result in contract modifications resulting in changes to rent amounts, lease durations, or other provisions of our lease agreements and in the termination of certain leases leading to the transition of certain properties over time and the incurrence of certain expenses, including but not limited to impairment charges, which could be material. 66Table of ContentsCash Flow InformationThe following table sets forth our cash flows (in thousands):Year ended December 31,20242023$ ChangeNet cash used in operating activities$(129,222)$(110,904)$(18,318)Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities5,729 (12,362)18,091 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities59,851 (32,232)92,083 Effects of foreign exchange on cash(801)2,809 (3,610)Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$(64,443)$(152,689)$88,246 Operating ActivitiesNet cash used in operating activities increased year-over year, primarily due to an increase in cash paid for lease terminations, restructuring, and professional fees, partially offset by an improvement in our operating loss performance due to a 3.2% increase in revenue. Cash used in operating activities is subject to variability period-over-period as a result of timing differences, including with respect to the collection of receivables and payments of interest expense, accounts payable, and other items.Investing ActivitiesNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities increased year-over-year, primarily as a result of a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of $7.5 million, largely related to a decrease in purchases for furnishings and fixtures for our Live Units, the receipt of $7.5 million in Key Money proceeds from Marriott as described in the Marriott Agreement, and an increase of $1.5 million in proceeds on disposition of property and equipment.Financing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased year-over-year, primarily related to proceeds received in the year ended December 31, 2024 of $43.3 million from the preferred stock issuance, a decrease in repayment of debt and related fees of $34.2 million primarily related to a partial repayment of the Delayed Draw Notes in the year ended December 31, 2023, and an increase of $17.0 million year-over-year due to debt financing proceeds from the issuance of an aggregate of $20.0 million of Delayed Draw Notes, inclusive of the New Delayed Draw Warrants, as defined in Note 7, Debt, in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2024, we had the following off-balance sheet arrangements:Letters of CreditWe had $48.3 million of irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding, which were collateralized by our restricted cash, of which $33.3 million were under our revolving credit facilities. Letters of credit are primarily used as a form of security deposits for the buildings and partial buildings we lease. Surety BondsA portion of our leases are supported by surety bonds provided by affiliates of certain insurance companies. As of December 31, 2024, we had assembled commitments from six surety providers in the amount of $38.3 million, of which $16.9 million was outstanding and was an off-balance sheet arrangement. The surety bonds are collateralized by our remaining outstanding letters of credit. The availability, terms and conditions, and pricing of bonding capacity are dependent on, among other things, continued financial strength and stability of the insurance company affiliates providing the bonding capacity, general availability of such capacity, our corporate credit rating, and the general perception of our financial performance.67Table of ContentsIndemnification AgreementsSee Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included within Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our indemnification agreements. Effect of Exchange RatesOur changes in cash can be impacted by the effect of fluctuating exchange rates. Foreign exchange had a positive effect on cash in the year ended December 31, 2024, increasing our total cash balance by $0.8 million at December 31, 2024, and a negative effect on cash in the year ended December 31, 2023, decreasing our total cash balance by $2.8 million at December 31, 2023.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. We have identified certain policies and estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our past or present consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they have a material impact, or they have the potential to have a material impact, on our consolidated financial statements and because they require us to make significant judgments, assumptions, or estimates. We believe that the judgments, estimates, and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable and appropriate, based on the information available at the time they were made. However, actual results may differ from those estimates, and these differences may be material.LeasesOur cost of revenue primarily consists of rental expenses from buildings or portions of buildings that serve as accommodations for our guests. We also lease other properties such as warehouses to store furniture. Our rent payment schedules vary by lease term per executed lease agreements and can be monthly, quarterly, or bi-annually. A large majority of our leases contain provisions for rent abatement periods, rent escalation, and tenant improvement allowances. Certain leases require the payment of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, and certain common area maintenance costs in addition to minimum rent payments. These amounts are expensed as incurred and are included within cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of operations if paid directly to the lessor, or in operations and support if paid to the authority assessing the cost for guest properties and within general and administrative on our consolidated statements of operations for our warehouses.In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), (Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842), at the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as ROU assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. We do not have material financing leases.Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, we utilize our incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments, which reflects the fixed rate at which we could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. The determination of our incremental borrowing rate requires estimates surrounding our credit rating, credit spread, and the impact of collateral. To estimate our incremental borrowing rate, a credit rating applicable to us is estimated using a synthetic credit rating analysis since we do not currently have an agency-based credit rating. Prospectively, we will adjust the ROU assets for straight-line rent expense or any incentives received and remeasure the lease liability at the net present value using the same incremental borrowing rate that was in effect as of the lease commencement or transition date.We have elected not to recognize leases with an original term of one year or less on the balance sheet. We typically only include an initial lease term in our assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in our assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that we will renew. Assumptions that we made at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events, including a lease modification. A lease modification results in a separate contract when the modification grants the lessee an additional right of use not included in the original lease and 68Table of Contentswhen lease payments increase commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right of use. When a lease modification results in a separate contract, it is accounted for in the same manner as a new lease.In accordance with ASC 842, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components, non-lease components, and non-components. The fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any consideration related to non-components) must be allocated based on the respective relative fair values to the lease components and non-lease components. Entities may elect not to separate lease and non-lease components. Rather, entities would account for each lease component and related non-lease component together as a single lease component. We have elected to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component for all underlying assets and allocate all of the contract consideration to the lease component only. ASC 842 allows for the use of judgment in determining whether the assumed lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset and whether the present value of lease payments represents substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. We apply the bright line thresholds referenced in ASC 842-10-55-2 to assist in evaluating leases for appropriate classification. The aforementioned bright lines are applied consistently to our entire portfolio of leases.Upon termination of a lease, related lease balances on the consolidated balance sheet are written-off. A liability for costs to terminate a lease before the end of its term is recognized in accordance with the lease terms and recorded in operations and support on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets that are held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The asset group is comprised of both property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets. Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Our estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the lease term is based upon our experience, the historical operations and estimates of future profitability and economic conditions. The estimates of future profitability and economic conditions require estimating assumptions such as forecasting revenue and expenses. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, as well as other methods and approaches, as necessary.Any impairments to ROU assets, leasehold improvements, or other assets as a result of a sublease, abandonment, or other similar factor are recorded as an operating expense. Similar to other long-lived assets, management tests ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For ROU assets, such circumstances may include subleases that do not fully recover the costs of the associated leases or a decision to abandon the use of all or part of an asset. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for income taxes, and evaluating the impact of tax law changes, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates.In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we weigh both positive and negative evidence in the various jurisdictions in which we operate to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are recoverable. We regularly assess all available evidence, including cumulative historic losses and forecasted earnings. Due to cumulative losses in the U.S. during the current and prior two years, including tax deductible stock compensation, and based on all available positive and negative evidence, we do not believe it is more likely than not that our net U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized as of December 31, 2024. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established in the United States, and no deferred tax assets and related tax benefit have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. 69Table of ContentsWhile we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.Fair Market Value of the August 2024 Securities Purchase AgreementsOn August 13, 2024, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements with certain qualified institutional buyers or accredited investors of an aggregate of $43.3 million newly issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, in exchange for cash consideration of approximately $43.3 million (the “Securities Purchase Agreements”). The sale of the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreements took place in multiple tranches. The first tranche closed on August 13, 2024 and comprised of about 14.7 million shares of Preferred Stock for a purchase price of approximately $14.7 million. The second tranche closed on November 6, 2024 and comprised of about 28.6 million shares of Preferred Stock in total for a purchase price of approximately $28.6 million. The Company recognized a loss on the preferred stock transaction based on the fair market value of (a) the equity-classified preferred stock, (b) the liability-classified forward contract, and (c) the liability-classified participation rights as of the transaction date. The Company measured the Series A Preferred Stock as of August 13, 2024, the forward contract liability from inception on August 13, 2024 through settlement at the closing of the second tranche on November 6, 2024, and the preferred stock participation right from inception on August 13, 2024 through December 31, 2024 at fair value. The valuation model and discount rate assumption used in the valuation model had a significant effect on the fair value measurement of the equity-classified preferred stock and the liability-classified forward contract. The liability-classified forward contract and participation rights are remeasured each reporting period reflecting fluctuations in the underlying variables and assumptions.Recent Accounting StandardsSee Note 2, Recently Issued Accounting Standards, to the consolidated financial statements included within Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding recently adopted accounting standards and recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted.Emerging Growth Company StatusSection 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”) exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can choose not to take advantage of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, and any such election to not take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable.We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act and have elected to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period for new or revised financial accounting standards. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.235 billion or more during such fiscal year (as indexed for inflation); (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in the prior three-year period; or (iv) December 31, 2026, and we expect to continue to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period, although we may decide to early adopt such new or revised accounting standards to the extent permitted by such standards. This may make it difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.70Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskSonder’s substantial global operations exposes it to various market risks, primarily including foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, and inflation risk. Foreign Currency Exchange RiskSonder transacts business in multiple currencies worldwide. The most significant currency supporting Sonder’s operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was the U.S. dollar. Sonder’s international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, exposes it to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, Sonder is subject to foreign currency risk, which may adversely impact its financial results. Sonder has foreign currency exchange risks related primarily to: •Revenue, rent, and cleaning fees, which are included in cost of revenue, associated with bookings through its direct and indirect channels denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar; •Balances held as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of guests as well as funds payable, amounts payable to guests and deposits due from landlords; and •Intercompany balances primarily related to its payment entities that process payments.For revenue and cost of revenue associated with bookings through its direct and indirect channels outside of the U.S., Sonder generally receives net foreign currency amounts and therefore benefits from a weakening of the U.S. dollar and is adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Movements in foreign exchange rates are recorded in other expense, net in Sonder’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Sonder has experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in foreign exchange gains and losses related to variable exchange rates. If Sonder’s foreign-currency denominated assets, liabilities, revenue, or expenses increase, its results of operations may be more significantly impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which Sonder does business. Interest Rate Risk Sonder is exposed to interest rate risk related primarily to its outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on its total cash as well as interest paid on its debt. Sonder has not been exposed to, nor anticipates exposure to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would not have had a material impact on its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024. Continued increases in interest rates have caused and may continue to cause some property owners and developers to have difficulty financing, refinancing, or completing projects that we plan to lease or that are currently under contract with us. As a result, any such properties in our forecast property pipeline may never develop into new sources of revenue when we anticipated, or at all.Inflation Risk Many of our major markets, including the U.S., have been experiencing elevated inflation levels as a result of global supply and demand imbalances, where global demand continues to outpace current supplies. Inflationary pressures, particularly as they relate to construction costs for properties we plan to lease, rent escalations associated with changes in price indexes, and other material costs to our business, along with supply chain disruptions, could result in increases to our operating and capital costs that are not fixed, reductions in consumers’ willingness or ability to travel, and fewer units in our pipeline of potential leased properties. These economic variables are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 71Table of ContentsItem 8.

Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sonder Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, mezzanine equity and stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Going ConcernThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and negative operating cash flows, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MattersLeases — Refer to Notes 1 and 9 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company leases buildings or portions of buildings for guest usage and warehouses to store furniture under operating lease agreements. As of December 31, 2024, operating lease right-of-use assets (“ROU assets”) were $1.0 billion, current operating lease liabilities were $172 million, and non-current operating lease liabilities were $1.0 billion. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases (“ASC 842”), the Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease, and how to account for the lease, based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement.Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments used in measuring lease ROU assets and liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the fixed rate at which an entity could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. Since the Company does not currently have a ratings agency-based credit rating, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate using a synthetic credit rating analysis, its estimated credit spread, and an estimated impact of collateral on the respective lease.We identified the accounting for leases as a critical audit matter because of a) the complexities associated with evaluating the unique facts and circumstances, including those in contractual provisions, present in certain of the Company’s leases, and b) the significant estimates and assumptions made by the Company such as its credit rating, credit spread, and the impact of collateral in the determination of the incremental borrowing rate. This required extensive audit effort due to the 73Table of Contentsvolume and complexities of the Company’s leases and a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of estimates used in the Company’s accounting for leases and determination of the incremental borrowing rate.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to the accounting for leases included the following, among others:•We selected a sample of leases and performed the following:◦Tested the facts and circumstances used in the calculation of the ROU asset and the lease liability by agreeing the underlying inputs, such as the lease commencement date, lease term, and lease payments to executed lease agreements.◦Evaluated the Company’s application of ASC 842 to the facts and circumstances of the lease.◦Tested the mathematical accuracy of the Company’s calculation of the lease ROU asset and lease liability.•With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we:◦Evaluated the reasonableness of the methodology used by the Company in applying the principles of ASC 842 to estimate the incremental borrowing rate.◦Evaluated the reasonableness of significant estimates and assumptions made by the Company such as its credit rating, credit spread, and the impact of collateral in the determination of the incremental borrowing rate by comparing them to the Company-specific benchmarks, information regarding comparable companies, and other market information.◦Tested the mathematical accuracy of the Company’s calculation used in determining the incremental borrowing rate.Operating Lease Right-of-use Assets and Property and Equipment, net – Impairment of Long-lived Assets — Refer to Notes 1, 6, and 9 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionLong-lived assets that are held and used by the Company, including ROU assets, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The asset group is comprised of both property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets. Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, as well as other methods and approaches, as necessary. Impairment charges recorded related to long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $13.2 million.We identified impairment of long-lived assets as a critical audit matter because the estimated future cash flows to determine the recoverability of long-lived assets requires significant management estimates and assumptions, specifically forecasting future revenue and expenses. Additionally, the measurement of an impairment loss involves determination of the fair value of an asset group, which includes estimates of market rental rates.Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company’s estimates and assumptions used in determining the recoverability and measuring the impairment of long-lived assets involved a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists and to involve more experienced audit professionals.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to management's estimates and assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows, specifically forecasting future revenue and expenses and fair value of asset groups included the following, among others:74Table of Contents•We evaluated management's ability to accurately estimate future cash flows by comparing actual results to management's historical forecasts.•We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimated future cash flows by comparing the projections to historical results, industry publications and other relevant publicly available information.•With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology utilized by management to estimate the fair value of the asset group.•We evaluated the mathematical accuracy and consistency of the application of the Company's valuation model with the assistance of our fair value specialists, including the fair market rental rates utilized by management to estimate the fair value of the asset group.Redeemable Preferred Stock – Refer to Notes 5 and 8 of the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionOn August 13, 2024, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements with certain qualified institutional buyers or accredited investors of an aggregate of 43,300,000 newly issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Series A Preferred Stock”), in exchange for cash consideration of $1.00 per share and in an aggregate amount of approximately $43.3 million (“Securities Purchase Agreements”). The first tranche closed on August 13, 2024 and the second tranche closed on November 6, 2024.The Company identified the following freestanding financial instruments issued in connection with the transaction, a) mezzanine equity-classified Series A Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”), b) liability-classified forward contract for commitments of investors to purchase, and commitments of the Company to sell, additional Series A Preferred Stock (“forward contract liability”), and c) liability-classified preferred stock participation right (together “Freestanding Financial Instruments”).The Company measured the Series A Preferred Stock as of August 13, 2024, the forward contract liability from inception on August 13, 2024 through settlement at the closing of the second tranche on November 6, 2024 and the preferred stock participation right from inception on August 13, 2024 through December 31, 2024 at fair value. The valuation model and discount rate assumption used in the valuation model of the Series A Preferred Stock and the forward contract liability had a significant effect on the fair value measurement of these instruments.We identified the accounting for the Securities Purchase Agreements and management’s fair value measurements of the Series A Preferred Stock and forward contract liability as a critical audit matter due to the complexity of the agreements and the significant judgments made by management in determining the valuation model and discount rate to be used in the valuation. Auditing the Securities Purchase Agreements required a high degree of auditor judgment and the involvement of more experienced personnel to evaluate management’s identification of the Freestanding Financial Instruments. Given that management’s judgments related to the valuation model and discount rate were especially challenging, this required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our fair value specialists.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to the accounting for the Securities Purchase Agreements and management’s fair value measurements of the Series A Preferred Stock and the forward contract liability included the following, among others:•We involved more experienced personnel to read and analyze the Stock Purchase Agreements and management's accounting for these agreements, including the identification of the Freestanding Financial Instruments.•With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we:◦Evaluated the appropriateness of management's application of the valuation model.◦Evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate used by developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those estimates to the discount rate assumptions selected by management.◦Evaluated the mathematical accuracy and consistency of the application of the Company’s valuation model.75Table of Contents/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLPSan Francisco, CaliforniaJuly 23, 2025We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.76Table of ContentsSONDER HOLDINGS INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1. Basis of PresentationNature of OperationsSonder Holdings Inc., together with its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), provides short and long-term accommodations to travelers in various cities across North America, Europe, and the Middle East. We are a leading global brand of premium, design-forward apartments and intimate boutique hotels serving the modern traveler. Launched in 2014, Sonder offers inspiring, thoughtfully designed accommodations and innovative, tech-enabled service combined into one seamless experience. On January 18, 2022, the Company consummated the previously announced business combination by and among Gores Metropoulos II, Inc. (“GMII”), two subsidiaries of GMII, and Sonder Operating Inc., a Delaware corporation formerly known as Sonder Holdings Inc. (“Legacy Sonder”) (the “Business Combination”). Basis of Financial Statement Presentation and Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”, “U.S. GAAP”, or “generally accepted accounting principles”). The consolidated financial statements present the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of Sonder Holdings Inc., its wholly owned subsidiaries, and one variable interest entity (“VIE”) for which it is the primary beneficiary in accordance with consolidation accounting guidance. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.The Company accounts for its VIE in accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation and evaluates its ownership, contractual, and other interests in entities to assess whether it has a variable interest in entities in which it has a financial relationship and, if so, whether or not those entities are VIEs. For an entity to qualify as a VIE, ASC 810 requires the Company to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and, if so, to consolidate such entity into its consolidated financial statements. If the Company determines that it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the ASC 810 requires the Company to account for the investment or other variable interest in a VIE in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP. The Company consolidates its VIE in which it holds a controlling financial interest, and is therefore deemed the primary beneficiary. Periodically, the Company reevaluates its ownership, contractual, and other interests in entities to determine whether any changes in its interest or relationship with an entity impacts the determination of whether it is still the primary beneficiary of such entity. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s consolidated VIE was not material to the consolidated financial statements.The Company qualifies as an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, and as a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, and, as such, may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements and deferred accounting standards adoption dates, and is relieved of other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to other public companies.Notice of DelistingOn April 24, 2025, the Company received a notice (the “10-K Notice”) from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, because the Company is delinquent in filing the 2024 Form 10-K, the Company no longer complies with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Listing Rule”), which requires companies with securities listed on Nasdaq to timely file all required periodic reports with the SEC. On May 23, 2025, the Company received a notice (the “Q1 10-Q Notice” and together with the 10-K Notice, the “Notices”) from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, because the Company is delinquent in filing the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025, the Company continues to not comply with the Listing Rule. The Notices have no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s common stock or Public Warrants on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.In accordance with Nasdaq’s listing rules, the Company has 60 calendar days after the 10-K Notice to submit a plan of compliance (the “Plan”) to Nasdaq demonstrating the Company’s ability to regain compliance with the Listing Rule and Nasdaq has the discretion to grant the Company up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the 2024 Form 10-K, or October 13, 2025, to regain compliance. The filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K cures the filing deficiency described in the 10-K Notice and the Company submitted the Plan on June 23, 2025.81Table of ContentsGoing ConcernThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with general accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has a history of net losses and negative operating cash flows and expects to continue to incur additional losses in the future. Although the Company continues to pursue a strategy to realize improved operations, including anticipated improvements from integration through the Marriott Agreement, the timing of realization cannot be guaranteed to ensure liquidity is available when needed to meet the Company’s obligations. As a result of these considerations, the Company’s liquidity may be insufficient to meet its obligations for at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements, which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.Management’s plans to address the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, as described above, include the following actions:•engaging a financial advisor to assist in identifying and securing strategic alternatives and financing arrangements,•continuing to focus on identifying and executing cost optimization initiatives;•continuing to execute our portfolio optimization program to mitigate losses related to certain underperforming properties and to assess the Company’s portfolio of rents relative to current operations and existing market rents; and•improving its financial performance through the potential to increase revenue by integrating with Marriott’s commercial engine and deliver costs savings.There can be no assurances of the Company’s ability to realize these plans. As a result, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements.Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company manages the credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by investing in lower risk money market funds and by maintaining operating accounts that are diversified among various institutions with good credit quality. The Company maintains cash accounts that, at times, exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses from maintaining cash accounts in excess of such limits. Management believes that it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash and cash equivalent accounts.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Examples of management’s estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the fair value of share-based awards, estimated useful life of long-lived assets, bad-debt allowances, valuation of intellectual property and intangible assets, contingent liabilities, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, ROU asset impairment valuation of the preferred stock issuance and valuation of non-routine complex transactions, such as recognition of the Earn Out Liability, SPAC Warrants (each as defined below) and forward contracts, among others. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; therefore, actual results could differ from those estimates.Segment Information An operating segment is defined as a component of an entity that: (i) engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, (ii) is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) for performance assessment and resource allocation decisions, and (iii) has discrete financial information available. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer.The Company has one operating and reportable segment, as the CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation.82Table of ContentsThe key measure of segment profit or loss utilized by the CODM to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Company’s operating segment is consolidated net loss. Net loss is used in monitoring budget versus actual results. This measure is presented on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Significant segment expenses included in net loss include cost of revenue, operations and support, general and administrative, research and development, sales and marketing and interest expense, net, which are presented on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheet as total consolidated assets. Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets that are held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, as well as other methods and approaches, as necessary.Any impairments to ROU assets, leasehold improvements, or other assets as a result of a sublease, abandonment, or other similar factor are recorded as an operating expense. Similar to other long-lived assets, the Company tests ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For ROU assets, such circumstances may include subleases that do not fully recover the costs of the associated leases or a decision to abandon the use of all or part of an asset.Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue The Company generates revenues primarily by providing short-term or month-to-month accommodations to its guests. As a result, the Company’s performance obligation is to facilitate a stay, which is satisfied over time as the stay occurs. Revenues are recognized over time for guest stays, commencing upon guest check-in and ending at guest check-out, net of discounts and refunds. For short-term accommodations, the Company's guests agree to its Terms of Service (“ToS”) and make payments for their accommodations at the time of reservation. For month-to-month accommodations, the Company’s guests agree to its ToS and make payments for their accommodations in accordance with the related contracts. For accommodations booked through OTAs, payments for accommodations are made by OTAs to the Company based on the ToS that the Company has with OTAs. Guests generally have the right to cancel a stay prior to check-in, and are entitled to refunds in accordance with the agreed-upon ToS. Payments received from guests prior to check-in are recognized as deferred revenue, a contract liability, on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred revenue is reduced over the period in which a guest completes a stay and is recognized as revenue. Substantially all of the deferred revenue balances at the end of each fiscal year are expected to be recognized as revenue in the subsequent year. Payments received after guest check-in are primarily from OTAs that guests use to book accommodations and are recognized as accounts receivable, net of allowance, after guest check-out. The Company is required to collect certain taxes and fees from guests on behalf of governmental agencies and remit these to the applicable governmental agencies on a periodic basis. The Company recognizes revenues net of such taxes and fees collected. 83Table of ContentsLeases The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. The lease term is also determined at lease inception and generally begins on the date the Company takes possession of the full or partial portions of leased premises. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease payments, initial direct costs, lease incentives, and impairment of operating lease assets. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The determination of our incremental borrowing rate requires estimates surrounding our credit rating, credit spread, and the impact of collateral. The Company has certain lease agreements that contain lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component.The Company’s leases often contain rent escalations over the lease term. The Company recognizes expense for fixed, scheduled escalations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company recognizes variable expense, accounted for as discussed below, for escalations associated with a change in an index or rate. Additionally, tenant incentives, primarily used to fund leasehold improvements, are recognized when earned and reduce the Company’s ROU asset related to the lease. These are amortized through the ROU asset as reductions of expense over the lease term.Certain leases contain variable costs such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, and certain common area maintenance costs in addition to minimum rent payments. These amounts are expensed as incurred and are included within cost of revenue if paid directly to the lessor or in operations and support if paid to the authority assessing the cost for the properties used for guests and within general and administrative for warehouses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For leases with an initial non-cancelable lease term of 12 months or less and no option to purchase, the Company elected not to recognize the lease on its consolidated balance sheets and instead recognize rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term within operations and support on its consolidated statements of operations.Cash and Restricted Cash The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash. Cash is held in checking and interest-bearing accounts, and is recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Restricted cash consists of cash collateral for standby letters of credit with a bank that were issued to the Company’s real estate owners and for collateral required by the bank to support the Company's corporate credit card programs.84Table of ContentsSupplemental Cash Flow InformationThe following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in thousands):20242023Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information:Cash paid for income taxes during the year$679 $905 Cash paid for interest during the year$2,183 $2,464 Supplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities:Operating ROU assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities, net of adjustments(1)$(119,464)$205,285 Reconciliation of cash and restricted cash:Cash$20,786 $95,763 Restricted cash51,268 40,734 Cash and restricted cash at end of period$72,054 $136,497 (1) Operating ROU assets declines are primarily due to the impact of lease terminations related to the portfolio optimization program. These lease terminations primarily occurred during the first half of 2024.Fair Value MeasurementsThe Company applies fair value accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. Refer to Note 5, Fair Value Measurement and Financial Instruments, for additional information.Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowance for Expected Credit LossesTrade accounts receivable are recorded for guest stays primarily from bookings made through OTAs or through the Company’s sales personnel where payments are made to the Company after guest check-outs. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are non-interest bearing. The Company maintains an allowance which reflects its best estimate of its exposure to balances deemed to be uncollectible. Accounts receivable are written off as a decrease to the allowance when all collection efforts have been exhausted and an account is deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense when received. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives of the Company’s assets are as follows:Classification:Estimated Useful LifeFurniture and fixtures3 yearsComputers, software, and office equipment3 yearsInternal-use software2 yearsLeasehold improvementsShorter of remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of 3 yearsDepreciation and amortization expense are generally classified within the corresponding operating expenses line items on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and 85Table of Contentsamortization are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use, which includes its booking and pricing platform, mobile apps, and website development. The Company capitalizes costs when preliminary software development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for software enhancements that are expected to result in additional material functionality are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the enhancements.Foreign Currency The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Functional currency is determined for each of the Company's foreign subsidiaries by reviewing its operations and currencies used in its primary economic environments. Assets and liabilities for foreign subsidiaries with functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange existing at the balance sheet date. Statements of operations and comprehensive loss amounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Translation gains and losses are recorded in cumulative translation adjustment as a component of stockholders’ deficit in the consolidated balance sheets. Remeasurement gains and losses are included in other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities are measured at historical exchange rates. Cost of RevenueThe Company’s cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) primarily consists of fixed and variable lease costs to real estate owners for Live Units, cleaning costs, and payment processing charges.Operations and Support Operations and support expenses are related to guest-facing functions and variable expenses associated with property-level operations, such as customer service agents and hospitality agents, depreciation of property and equipment, utilities, costs to open new properties, and the cost of guest-room consumable items and low-cost furnishings. These costs are expensed as incurred. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses for administrative functions, such as legal, finance, accounting, public policy, and human resources. It also includes certain professional services fees, technology expenses, bad debt expense, general corporate and director and officer insurance, and other corporate-level expenses the Company incurs to manage and support its operations. These costs are expensed as incurred. Research and Development Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses and an allocation of facility expenses incurred in connection with the development of the Company’s existing and new services. These costs are expensed as incurred. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising expenses, personnel-related expenses for sales, marketing, and branding, as well as service charges for bookings made through OTAs. These costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising Expenses 86Table of ContentsAdvertising expenses, a majority of which consist of internet and social media marketing, were $18.8 million and $15.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These costs are expensed as incurred. Stock-Based Compensation Related to Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and RSUs in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years. The compensation expense related to stock options is based on the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the grant date, which requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the value of the underlying stock on the date of grant for options granted before the Company was publicly traded, the expected term of the option, the price volatility of the underlying stock, expected dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate. The compensation expense related to RSUs is based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The Company estimates the expected term for options based on its historical pattern of option exercise behavior and the period of time options are expected to be outstanding. The contractual term of the Company's stock options is generally ten years. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock on the date of grant based on the average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly traded companies. Dividend yields have been, and are expected to be, zero given the Company's dividend payment history and plans. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the grant date with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option award. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures of stock-based compensation awards as they occur.Stock-Based Compensation Related to Performance and Market-Based Awards The Company recognizes the compensation expense related to performance and market-based awards based on its estimate of the fair value of the award using a Monte-Carlo simulation on the grant date. The Monte-Carlo simulation utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that performance conditions will be achieved. These variables include the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, and the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award. The Company recognizes compensation expense for its performance awards using an accelerated attribution method from the time it is deemed probable that the vesting condition will be met through the time the service-based vesting condition has been achieved. The Company recognizes compensation expense for its market-based awards over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method.Restructuring ChargesCosts and liabilities associated with management-approved restructuring activities are recognized when they are incurred. One-time employee termination costs are recognized at the time of communication to employees, unless future service is required, in which case the costs are recognized ratably over the future service period. Ongoing employee termination benefits are recognized as a liability when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount is reasonably estimable. Restructuring charges are recognized in the restructuring and other charges line item of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and related liabilities are recorded within accrued liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company periodically evaluates and, if necessary, adjusts its estimates based on currently available information.Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss as of the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2024, with the exception of Europe and Middle East and Canada, and in December 31, 2023, with the exception of Canada, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to its history of losses.87Table of ContentsThe Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. Taxes payable on the Company’s consolidated balances sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 includes both income taxes payable and indirect taxes payable.Net Loss Per Share The Company applies the two-class method when computing net loss per share when shares are issued that meet the definition of a participating security. The two-class method determines net loss per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires earnings available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all earnings for the period had been distributed.Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less weighted-average shares subject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are anti-dilutive.Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive loss consists of net loss and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consists of foreign currency translation adjustments related to consolidation of foreign entities. Other comprehensive loss is recorded as a component of stockholders’ deficit and is excluded from net loss.ContingenciesThe Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for losses associated with legal claims when such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change. Related legal fees are expensed as incurred.Note 2. Recently Issued Accounting StandardsThe following reflect recent accounting standards that have been adopted or are pending adoption by the Company. As discussed in Note 1, Basis of Presentation, the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company, and as such, has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and is not subject to the new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies during the extended transition period. The accounting standards discussed below indicate effective dates for the Company as an emerging growth company with the extended transition period.Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.

Fair Value Measurement and Financial InstrumentsFair Value HierarchyAccounting standards require the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets. These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. These are typically quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.A financial instrument’s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.Forward Contract LiabilityAs part of the August 2024 Securities Purchase Agreements, as described further in Note 8, Redeemable Preferred Stock, the transaction included a liability-classified forward contract for commitments of investors to purchase, and commitments of the Company to sell, additional Series A Preferred Stock. This commitment ended upon the issuance of approximately 28.6 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock in November 2024. The Company recognized a change in fair value of the forward contract of $28.7 million as the remeasurement reflecting fluctuations in the underlying variables and assumptions from inception on August 13, 2024 through the final closing of the August 2024 Preferred Financing on November 6, 2024.Preferred Stock Participation Right91Table of ContentsAs part of the August 2024 Securities Purchase Agreements, as described further in Note 8, Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Company recognized a liability for preferred stock participation right (the “Preferred Stock Participation Right”) (as described below) of $1.3 million within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024. The change in fair value of the Preferred Stock Participation Right recognized from inception on August 13, 2024 through the year ended on December 31, 2024 was not significant.SPAC WarrantsAs part of the GMII initial public offering (“GMII IPO”), GMII issued 9,000,000 public warrants (the “Public Warrants”) and 5,500,000 private placement warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”), of which every 20 warrants are exercisable for one share of common stock at a price of $230.00 per common share (collectively, the “SPAC Warrants”).Management has determined that the SPAC Warrants issued in the GMII IPO, which remained outstanding at consummation of the Business Combination and became exercisable for shares of the Company’s common stock, are subject to accounting treatment as a liability. At the consummation of the Business Combination and at December 31, 2024, the Company used the Public Warrants stock price to value the Public Warrants.At consummation of the Business Combination, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation methodology to value the Private Placement Warrants using Level 3 inputs since the Company did not have observable inputs for the valuation. At December 31, 2022, the Company used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants using Level 3 inputs. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Private Placement Warrants were transferred by the original holders and, in accordance with the contractual terms of the Private Placement Warrants, became Public Warrants upon transfer. As such, at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company used the Public Warrants stock price to value all SPAC Warrants.At December 31, 2024, the SPAC Warrants were valued at $0.01 per warrant. Refer to Note 10, Warrants and Stockholders' Deficit, for additional information about the SPAC Warrants.Earn Out LiabilityIn addition to the consideration paid at consummation of the Business Combination, certain investors may receive their pro rata share of up to an aggregate of 725,000 additional shares of the Company’s common stock as consideration upon the common stock achieving certain benchmark share prices, as set forth in the merger agreement (the “Earn Out”). Management has determined that the Earn Out is subject to treatment as a liability (the “Earn Out Liability”).At December 31, 2024, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation methodology to value the Earn Out Liability using Level 3 inputs. The key assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation are related to expected share-price volatility of 87.5%, expected term of 2.54 years, risk-free interest rate of 4.3%, and dividend yield of 0%. The expected volatility at December 31, 2024 was derived from the volatility of comparable public companies.Delayed Draw WarrantsThe fair value of the Delayed Draw Warrants (as defined in Note 7, Debt) was estimated by separating the Delayed Draw Notes into the debt and warrants components and assigning a fair value to each component. The value assigned to the debt component was the estimated fair value as of the issuance date of similar debt without the warrants. The value assigned to the Delayed Draw Warrants component was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using Level 3 inputs and was considered to be non-recurring in nature, in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. The warrants component was recorded as a debt discount, which is amortized using the effective interest method over the period from the date of issuance through the maturity date. Upon consummation of the Business Combination, the fair value of the Delayed Draw Warrants was $5.6 million and was recorded within additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. As described in Note 7, Debt, in connection with the Third Notes Amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers received New Delayed Draw Warrants and the previously issued Delayed Draw Warrants to the NPA Purchasers were canceled. In August 2024, all New Delayed Draw Warrants were exercised for cash. NPA Waiver Obligation and NPA Waiver Warrants 92Table of ContentsIn connection with the NPA Waiver (as defined in Note 7, Debt), the Company promised to issue shares or to deliver cash to the NPA Purchasers (as defined in Note 7, Debt) (the “NPA Waiver Obligation”). The Company accounted for the NPA Waiver Obligation as a liability classified instrument. Upon issuing the NPA Waiver Obligation, the fair value was $1.3 million. Following approval of the Share Increase Proposal (as defined in the NPA Waiver) at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders held on December 23, 2024 (the “2024 Annual Meeting”), on December 30, 2024, the Company issued warrants to the NPA Purchasers (as defined in the NPA Waiver) to purchase an aggregate of 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, each with an exercise of $0.01 (the “NPA Waiver Warrants”). The NPA Waiver Obligation was marked to fair value of $1.6 million immediately prior to the settlement of the obligation. Upon settlement of the obligation, the NPA Waiver Obligation was recharacterized as NPA Waiver Warrants, which are accounted for as liabilities. As of the effective date of December 30, 2024, the NPA Waiver Warrants can be exercised with no restrictions. As such, at December 31, 2024, the Company’s stock price was used to value all NPA Waiver Warrants.Recurring Fair Value MeasurementsAt December 31, 2024, the Preferred Stock Participation Right and NPA Waiver Warrants were included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024, the Earn Out Liability and Public Warrants liability were included in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt approximates its fair value because it bears interest at a market rate and all other terms are also reflective of current market terms.These assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment. Any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other expense (income), net, on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.94Table of ContentsNote 6.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized immaterial losses on disposal. Loss on disposal was recorded in operations and support on the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.Note 7. DebtNote Purchase AgreementOn December 10, 2021, the Company entered into the Note Purchase Agreement with NPA Purchasers for the sale of delayed draw notes in the aggregate principal amount of $165.0 million to be available to the Company following the consummation of the Business Combination (the “Delayed Draw Notes”). The Note Purchase Agreement also provided for the issuance of warrants to purchase an aggregate of 123,750 shares of the Company’s common stock with an exercise price of $250.00 per share (the “Delayed Draw Warrants”). In January 2022, upon consummation of the Business Combination, the Company drew $165.0 million in Delayed Draw Notes and issued Delayed Draw Warrants to purchase 123,750 shares of common stock from the NPA Purchasers. The Delayed Draw Notes have a maturity of five years from the date of issuance and are subject to interest on the unpaid principal amount at a rate per annum equal to the three-month secured overnight financing rate plus 9.0% payable in cash.

On that date, all the Legacy Sonder Canada Exchangeable Shares were automatically converted into 1,616,767 Post-Combination Exchangeable Shares for a value of $49.7 million.The Company had the following authorized and outstanding Post-Combination Exchangeable Common Stock (in thousands except per share amounts):December 31, 2024December 31, 2023Shares Authorized2,000,000 2,000,000 Shares Issued and Outstanding551,072 712,982 Issuance Price Per Share$30.80 $30.80 Net Carrying Value$16,973 $21,960 Aggregate Liquidation Preference$16,973 $21,960 The net carrying value of the Post-Combination Exchangeable Shares is included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets.Redeemable Convertible Preferred StockUpon consummation of the Business Combination, all the Company’s shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were automatically converted into shares of post-combination common stock for a value of $518.8 million.Common and Preferred StockThe Company’s certificate of amendment of amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorized shares of all classes of capital stock were increased to 409,309,144 shares, consisting of: (a) 159,309,144 shares of general common stock, including: (i) 157,309,144 shares of common stock, and (ii) 2,000,000 shares of special voting common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and (b) 250,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share.The Company had reserved the following shares of common stock for future issuance:December 31, 2024December 31, 2023Post-Combination Exchangeable Common Shares551,072 712,982 Outstanding stock options2,129,040 2,685,922 Outstanding restricted stock units (“RSUs”)236,985 359,175 Outstanding market stock units (“MSUs”)531,996 567,500 Outstanding Public Warrants liability724,997 724,997 Shares issuable pursuant to Earn Out Liability725,000 725,000 Outstanding Delayed Draw Notes warrants liability— 123,750 Outstanding former Series C and D preferred stock warrants liability21,281 21,281 Shares available for grant under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan463,930 353,024 Shares available for grant under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan8,092,529 569,715 Shares available for grant under the 2023 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan326,677 141,800 Total common stock reserved for future issuance13,803,507 6,985,146 Note 11. Equity Incentive Plans and Stock-Based Compensation103Table of ContentsEquity Incentive Plans2013 and 2019 Equity Incentive Plans: Prior to consummation of the Business Combination, Legacy Sonder provided for the grant of stock-based awards to purchase or directly issue shares of common stock to employees, directors, and consultants through its 2013 and 2019 Equity Incentive Plans (the “Legacy Equity Incentive Plans”). Options were granted at a price per share equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. Stock options generally had a 10-year contractual term and vest over a four-year period starting from the date specified in each agreement. Each Legacy Sonder stock option from the Legacy Equity Incentive Plans that was outstanding immediately prior to consummation of the Business Combination, whether vested or unvested, was converted into an option to acquire a number of shares of common stock (the “Exchanged Options”) equal to the product of: (i) the number of shares of Legacy Sonder common stock subject to such Legacy Sonder option immediately prior to consummation of the Business Combination; and (ii) the recapitalization option exchange ratio. The Exchanged Options are exercisable at an exercise price per share equal to: (i) the exercise price per share of such Legacy Sonder option immediately prior to consummation of the Business Combination; divided by (ii) the recapitalization exchange ratio. Except as specifically provided in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated April 29, 2021 (as amended by the Amendment No. 1 to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 17, 2021), (collectively, the “Merger Agreement”), following the Business Combination, each Exchanged Option will continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the corresponding former Legacy Sonder option immediately prior to the Business Combination. All stock option activity was retroactively restated to reflect the Exchanged Options.Sonder Holdings Inc. 2021 Management Equity Incentive Plan: In connection with the Business Combination, GMII’s stockholders approved the 2021 Management Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Management Equity Incentive Plan”). Employees, including directors and officers, and consultants who receive awards under the 2021 Management Equity Incentive Plan may receive their pro-rata share of awards up to an aggregate of 725,000 shares of common stock that will vest upon the common stock achieving certain benchmark share prices as contemplated by the Merger Agreement. If these benchmark share prices are not achieved within the period specified in the Merger Agreement, the unvested awards will not be issued.Sonder Holdings Inc. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan: In connection with the Business Combination, GMII’s stockholders approved the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Equity Incentive Plan”). The 2021 Equity Incentive Plan became effective upon consummation of the Business Combination and succeeds the Legacy Equity Incentive Plans. Under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, the Company may grant options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, and performance awards to employees, directors, and consultants. Options are granted at a price per share equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. Options granted are exercisable over a maximum term of 10 years from the date of grant. RSUs typically have a cliff vesting period of one year and continue to vest quarterly thereafter. The Company is authorized to issue up to 9,957,029 shares under this plan, of which 8,092,529 shares remain available for future grants at December 31, 2024. The total number of shares that may be issued under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan will automatically increase on the first trading day of each calendar year, which began in calendar year 2022, by a number of shares equal to the lesser of: (i) 1,641,008 shares; (ii) 12.5% of the total number of shares outstanding as of immediately following consummation of the Business Combination (including the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exchange of Canadian Exchangeable Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement) issued in the Sonder Canada Share Capital Reorganization (as defined in the Merger Agreement) corresponding to shares of company special voting stock to be issued immediately following consummation of the Business Combination); (iii) five percent (5.0%) of the total number of shares outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year; and (iv) a lesser number of shares determined by the administrator. Sonder Holdings Inc. 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan: In connection with the Business Combination, GMII’s stockholders approved the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at 85.0% of stock price on the first trading day of the offering period or on the last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. Employees can contribute up to 15.0% of their eligible compensation to purchase shares. The ESPP provides for either (i) 27-month offering period, or (ii) such shorter period as may be established by the administrator from time to time. The Company is authorized to issue up to 463,930 shares under the ESPP, all of which remain available for future issuance as of December 31, 2024. 104Table of ContentsThe number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP will automatically be increased on the first day of each fiscal year, which began in calendar year 2022 and ends in the 2041 fiscal year, equal to the least of: (i) 328,202 shares of common stock; (ii) 2.5% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately following consummation of the Business Combination (including the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exchange of Canadian Exchangeable Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement) issued in the Sonder Canada Share Capital Reorganization (as defined in the Merger Agreement) corresponding to shares of Company special voting stock to be issued immediately following consummation of the Business Combination); (iii) one percent (0.1%) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year; or (iv) a lesser number of shares determined by the administrator. On December 31, 2024, the Company determined to not automatically increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025.Stock Option RepricingOn December 1, 2022 (the “Repricing Date”), the Company closed an offer to reprice certain eligible stock options, whether vested or unvested, with modified vesting terms such that all previously vested options became unvested on the Repricing Date. As a result of the repricing, the exercise price for a total of 1,014,631 options was reduced to $34.80 per share, or the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Repricing Date. As a result of the repricing, total incremental expense to be recognized over the remaining requisite service period of the repriced options, beginning at the Repricing Date, was determined to be $8.4 million.Stock-Based Compensation ExpenseTotal stock-based compensation expense is as follows (in thousands):Year ended December 31,20242023Operations and support$2,270 $7,456 General and administrative4,648 17,439 Research and development912 3,265 Sales and marketing175 338 Total stock-based compensation expense$8,005 $28,498 Stock Options: The Company measures stock-based compensation expense for stock options at the grant date fair value of the award and recognizes the expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense from stock options of approximately $2.5 million and $19.7 million, respectively. The Company recognizes only the portion of the option award granted that is ultimately expected to vest as compensation expense and elects to recognize gross share-based compensation expense with actual forfeitures as they occur.105Table of ContentsFair Value of Stock Options: The fair value of each stock option award is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses the fair value of the Company’s common stock and requires the input of the following subjective assumptions:Expected term. The expected term for options granted to employees, officers, and directors is based on the historical pattern of option exercise behavior and the period of time they are expected to be outstanding. Expected volatility. The expected volatility is based on the average volatility of similar public entities within the Company’s peer group as the Company’s stock has not been publicly trading for a long enough period to rely on its own expected volatility.Expected Dividends. The dividend assumption is based on the Company’s historical experience. To date, Company has not paid any dividends on its common stock.Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate used in the valuation is the implied yield currently available on the United States Treasury zero-coupon issues, with a remaining term equal to the expected life term of the Company’s options.The following table summarizes the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Company’s stock options granted to employees, non-employees, officers, and directors:Year ended December 31,20242023Expected term (in years)n/a6.09 - 6.22Expected volatilityn/a50.4% - 51.2%Dividend yieldn/a— %Risk-free interest raten/a3.50% - 4.40%Weighted-average grant-date fair value per sharen/a$1.35 - $13.69 Option activity under the Company’s equity incentive plans is as follows (in thousands, except share data, and term in years):Options OutstandingNumber ofOptionsWeighted-AverageExercise Priceper OptionWeighted-AverageRemainingContractualTermAggregateIntrinsic ValueBalance as of December 31, 20221,833,950 $39.80 7.63$88 Granted1,301,035 $11.47 Exercised(469)$17.71 Forfeited(305,787)$31.94 Canceled(142,806)$74.32 Balance as of December 31, 20232,685,923 $25.28 7.85$88 Forfeited(526,985)$18.48 Canceled(29,898)$51.38 Balance as of December 31, 20242,129,040 $26.60 5.00$67 As of December 31, 2024Options vested and exercisable1,382,501 $29.48 4.17Options vested and expected to vest2,129,040 $26.60 5.00$— The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2024 was zero, as no grants were made during the year ended December 31, 2024. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted 106Table of Contentsduring the year ended December 31, 2023 was $6.13. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were de minimis. Performance and Market-Based Equity Awards: The 2019 CEO Option Award. On November 15, 2023, the Legacy Sonder Board of Directors (the “Legacy Sonder Board”) granted an award to Francis Davidson, the Company’s former CEO, for a total of 280,664 options (the “2019 CEO Option Award”), which Mr. Davidson exercised in full in December 2020, with a promissory note payable to the Company in the amount of $24.6 million (the “Promissory Note”). 102,059 of these options vest in 72 equal monthly installments starting as of October 1, 2017 (the “Service-Based Options”), subject to Mr. Davidson’s continuous employment with the Company, and 178,604 options are performance-based and vest upon completion of certain performance milestones, subject to Mr. Davidson’s continuous employment with the Company. 127,573 of the performance-based options were modified during the year ended December 31, 2021 and, as a result, vested in full, while the remaining 51,029 performance-based awards vest upon the Company achieving a certain market capitalization milestone (the “Market Capitalization Condition”). The Promissory Note. The Promissory Note bore interest at the rate of 2.0% per annum, compounding semiannually. The principal amounts and accrued interest were due upon the consummation of the Business Combination. On January 14, 2022, the aggregate outstanding principal amount and interest under the Promissory Note was repaid in full as a result of Mr. Davidson selling 92,797 shares of Legacy Sonder common stock to the Company at a repurchase price of $277 per Legacy Sonder common share (number of shares and amount per share is not adjusted for the application of the recapitalization exchange ratio discussed above), which was equal to the fair value of a share of Legacy Sonder common stock as of the repurchase date, for a total aggregate repurchase price of $25.7 million. The Service-Based Options. The fair value of the Service-Based Options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The grant date fair value of these awards was $3.2 million and was recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the award. 2021 Modification of the 2019 CEO Option Award. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the CEO Performance Awards were modified to accelerate the vesting of the IPO Condition and the Qualified Financing Condition because the Legacy Sonder Board desired to reward Mr. Davidson in leading the Company to perform above expectations given the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the hospitality sector, and additionally, engaging the Company in potential strategic transactions which resulted in increased company valuations. While the vesting of the options under the Market Capitalization Condition were not accelerated by the Legacy Sonder Board, the Legacy Sonder Board approved a resolution clarifying that the Market Capitalization Condition would be eligible to vest in connection with a business combination with a special purpose acquisition company that otherwise achieves the applicable Market Capitalization Condition using an equivalent share price rather than the market capitalization. The modification-date fair values of the CEO Performance Awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that performance conditions will be achieved. These variables include the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award, historical and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, and the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award. The Company recognizes compensation expense for its performance awards using an accelerated attribution method from the time it is deemed probable that the vesting condition will be met through the time the service-based vesting condition has been achieved.The Company recognized $11.6 million in expense related to the acceleration of the IPO Condition and the Qualified Financing Condition during the year ended December 31, 2021, and did not recognize expense related to the IPO Condition or Qualified Financing Condition during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $0.1 million and $1.0 million in stock-based compensation expense related to the vesting of the Market Capitalization Condition, respectively.The 2021 CEO Option Award. On February 18, 2021, the Legacy Sonder Board granted a total of 3,061,794 options to Mr. Davidson (the “2021 CEO Option Award”). The options vest upon the successful consummation of the Business Combination and upon certain share price milestones, subject to Mr. Davidson’s continuous employment at the Company during each such event. The Company recognized $0.1 million and $0.9 million in expense related to the 2021 CEO Option Award during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The grant-date fair value of the 2021 CEO Option Award was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation. The grant-date fair value of the 2021 CEO Option Award on the grant date was $3.0 million.107Table of Contents2022 Modification of the 2019 CEO Option Award and the 2021 CEO Option Award. On December 28, 2022, the 2019 CEO Option Award shares subject to the Market Capitalization Condition and the 2021 CEO Option Award were amended. The amendments modified the vesting terms of the awards to align more closely with macroeconomic trends and the Company's performance. Prior to the amendments, the 2019 CEO Option Award included that the estimated price per share of the Company’s common stock that would be required to meet the market capitalization goal of $5.0 billion by November 19, 2026 was approximately $361.00. Pursuant to the amendments, adjustments were made to the performance goal required to be achieved by November 19, 2026 from a market capitalization goal of $5.0 billion to a stock price target of $105.40. Prior to the amendments, the 2021 CEO Option Award market value targets required to be achieved by December 31, 2023, December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2025 were approximately $304.00, $422.00, and $481.00. Pursuant to the amendment, the adjusted dates for the market value targets to be achieved, and the market value targets required to be achieved were changed to December 31, 2025 December 31, 2026 and December 31, 2027, and to $90.60, $127.80, and $142.80, respectively. The amendment represented a modification of the awards. The impact of the modification was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 and resulted in approximately $1.5 million of incremental expense to be recognized in future years, over the remaining life of the awards. RSUs: The fair value of the Company’s RSUs is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The Company’s RSUs generally vest over four years, with a cliff equal to one-fourth of the award after the first year, and then quarterly thereafter over the remaining service period. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense from RSUs of approximately $3.8 million and $6.1 million, respectively.RSU activity under the Company’s equity incentive plans is as follows: RSUs OutstandingNumber of RSUsWeighted-AverageGrant Date Fair ValueUnvested as of December 31, 2022583,707 $44.27 Granted141,987 12.19 Vested(154,062)43.74 Forfeited(212,457)39.04 Unvested as of December 31, 2023359,175 $34.94 Vested(28,422)40.70 Forfeited(93,768)37.68 Unvested as of December 31, 2024236,985 $32.52 MSUs: In May 2022, the Company issued MSUs to certain key executives in accordance with the Company’s 2021 Management Equity Incentive Plan. One-sixth of the MSUs vest upon (including prior to but contingent on) the occurrence of each of six distinct triggering events, including if certain share price targets are met, within the five-year period ending July 17, 2027.The Company determined the grant-date fair value of the MSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation for the MSUs over the requisite service period, which is approximately four years, using the accelerated attribution method. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not grant MSUs. During the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized approximately $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively, in stock-based compensation expense from MSUs. Note 12. Net Loss per Common ShareThe Company applies the two-class method when computing net loss per share attributable to common stockholders when shares are issued that meet the definition of a participating security. The two-class method determines net loss per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires earnings available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all earnings for the period had been distributed. 108Table of ContentsBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less weighted-average shares subject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are anti-dilutive.The following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except share data):Year ended December 31,20242023Numerator:Net loss$(224,087)$(295,668)Less: Accretion to redeemable value of preferred stock4,833 — Less: Paid-in-kind dividend on preferred stock5,051 — Net loss attributable to common stockholders$(233,971)$(295,668)Denominator: Weighted average basic and diluted common shares outstanding11,308,232 10,933,126 Net loss per common share:Basic and diluted net loss per share$(20.69)$(27.04)The following potential common shares outstanding were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because including them would have been anti-dilutive:Year ended December 31,20242023Convertible preferred stock43,300,000 — Options to purchase common stock2,129,040 2,685,923 Common stock subject to repurchase or forfeiture74,964 75,901 Outstanding RSUs236,985 359,175 Outstanding MSUs531,996 567,500 Exchangeable shares551,072 712,982 Total common stock equivalents46,824,057 4,401,481 Note 13. Commitments and ContingenciesOperating leasesSee Note 9, Leases, for commitments related to our operating leases.Surety BondsA portion of the Company’s leases are supported by surety bonds provided by affiliates of certain insurance companies. At December 31, 2024, the Company had commitments from six surety providers in the amount of $38.3 million, of which $16.9 million was outstanding. The availability, terms and conditions, and pricing of bonding capacity are dependent on, among other things, continued financial strength and stability of the insurance company affiliates providing the bonding capacity, general availability of such capacity, and the Company’s corporate credit rating.109Table of ContentsLegal and Regulatory MattersThe Company has been and expects to continue to become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings from time to time, including the matter described below. Except as described below, the Company is not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. Regardless of outcome, litigation and other legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, possible restrictions on the business as a result of settlement or adverse outcomes, and other factors.The Company establishes an accrued liability for loss contingencies related to legal matters when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. These accruals represent management’s best estimate of probable losses. The Company recorded an estimated accrual of $23.5 million and $17.3 million in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Management’s views and estimates related to these matters may change in the future, as new events and circumstances arise and the matters continue to develop. Until the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to losses in excess of the amounts accrued. With respect to outstanding legal matters, based on management’s current knowledge, the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. New York City LitigationIn February 2020, the Company was informed about an investigation underway by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene relating to possible Legionella bacteria contamination in the water supply at the Company’s property located at 20 Broad Street, New York, NY (the “Broad Street Property”). Due to the failure of the owner of the Broad Street Property (the “Broad Street Landlord”) to address the Legionella bacteria contamination and the associated health risks posed to guests, the Company withheld payment of rent to the Broad Street Landlord on grounds of, among other reasons, constructive eviction. On July 30, 2020, the Broad Street Landlord sued Sonder USA Inc., Sonder Canada Inc., and Sonder Holdings Inc. (the “Sonder Parties”) for breach of the lease, seeking no less than $3.9 million in damages. The Sonder Parties filed counterclaims against the Broad Street Landlord and the property management company for breach of contract, seeking significant damages. The Broad Street Landlord filed a motion for summary judgment. The hearing and oral argument for the summary judgment motion occurred on December 21, 2021. On October 13, 2023, the court issued an order granting the summary judgment motion with respect to liability for the claim for breach of guaranty against Sonder Canada Inc., the claim for breach of contract against Sonder USA Inc., and reasonable attorney’s fees; dismissing the Sonder Parties’ counterclaims; and ordering a trial for the amount of damages. On November 13, 2023, the Sonder Parties filed a notice of appeal of the October 13, 2023 court order on liability. On May 9, 2024, the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s order as to liability, but directed the trial court to allow the Sonder Parties the right to conduct discovery concerning the amount of the Broad Street Landlord’s alleged damages. Discovery has commenced in the trial court regarding the Broad Street Landlord’s alleged damages. A trial date to determine damages has not yet been set. On June 12, 2024, the Sonder Parties filed a motion in the appellate court seeking leave to reargue aspects of the appellate court’s order, or alternatively, for leave to appeal the order. On September 26, 2024, the appellate court granted the Sonder Parties’ motion to reargue and issued an order reversing the portion of the trial court’s decision dismissing the Sonder Parties’ breach of contract claim related to the Broad Street Landlord’s failure to maintain the plumbing systems in good repair for the period prior to when the Sonder Parties began withholding payment of rent. On October 21, 2024, the Broad Street Landlord filed a motion seeking leave to amend its complaint in order to assert $37 million in damages. Oral argument on that motion occurred in the trial court on March 5, 2025, and discovery is stayed pending the court’s determination of the motion.Sonder Stockholder LitigationOn April 11, 2024, a putative securities class action lawsuit titled Duffaydar v. Sonder Holdings Inc., et al., Case No. 24-cv-2952 was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (the “Central District Court”) naming the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors as defendants. A lead plaintiff and lead counsel were appointed, and an amended complaint was filed on December 23, 2024. The amended complaint purports to bring suit on behalf of stockholders who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company’s securities between March 16, 2023 and March 15, 2024, and alleges that the defendants made false and misleading statements about the Company’s financial results and condition, including the Company’s valuation of operating lease right of use assets, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The amended complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on February 21, 2025 and the Central District Court took the defendant’s motion to dismiss under 110Table of Contentssubmission. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible financial loss that could result from this matter. The Company believes the plaintiffs’ allegations are without merit and intends to defend the action vigorously.On January 28, 2025, a putative stockholder derivative lawsuit titled Versen v. Davidson, et al., Case No. 25-cv-761 was filed in the Central District Court naming certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors as defendants and naming the Company as a nominal defendant. The derivative complaint is based on allegations similar to those in the Duffaydar class action and purports to assert claims against the individual defendants for making false and misleading statements about the Company’s financial results and condition in violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and for breach of their fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act. The plaintiff seeks corporate reforms, unspecified damages and restitution, and fees and costs. On May 1, 2025, the Central District Court stayed this matter. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible financial loss that could result from this matter. On March 7, 2025, a putative stockholder derivative lawsuit titled Akcayli v. Davidson, et al., Case No. 25-cv-2060 was filed in the Central District Court naming certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors as defendants and naming the Company as a nominal defendant. The derivative complaint is based on allegations similar to those described in the Duffaydar class action and purports to assert similar claims against the same individual defendants as those in the Versen derivative action. The plaintiff seeks corporate reforms, unspecified damages and restitution, and fees and costs. On May 27, 2025, the Central District Court stayed this matter. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible financial loss that could result from this matter. On March 17, 2025, a putative stockholder derivative lawsuit titled Hunter v. Aggarwal, et al., Case No. 25-cv-2352 was filed in the Central District Court naming certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors as defendants and naming the Company as a nominal defendant. The derivative complaint is based on allegations similar to those described in the Duffaydar class action and purports to assert similar claims against the same individual defendants as the Versen derivative action. The plaintiff seeks corporate reforms, unspecified damages and restitution, and fees and costs. On June 27, 2025, the Central District Court entered an order continuing the defendants’ deadline to respond to the derivative complaint until after the Central District Court issues an order regarding the motion to dismiss in the Duffaydar class action. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible financial loss that could result from this matter. GMII LitigationOn December 23, 2024, a putative stockholder of GMII filed a purported class action lawsuit titled Porter v. Metropoulos, et al., Case No. 2024-1336 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against Gores Metropoulos Sponsor II, the directors and officers of GMII, and two of the Company’s officers. The complaint purports to assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment in connection with the merger between GMII and Legacy Sonder and seeks unspecified damages and disgorgement. An amended complaint was filed on May 9, 2025, which dismissed one of the Company’s officers. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May 23, 2025. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible financial loss that could result from this matter.Lawsuit SettlementsOn July 24, 2024, the Company favorably settled two lawsuits related to certain property leases for a total of $7.5 million payable in three tranches. The Company received the first tranche of $2.5 million in July 2024, the second tranche of $2.3 million in November 2024, and the third tranche of $2.7 million in January 2025. The Company recognized the settlement income when it was realized and earned accordingly in the periods of payment receipt.Tax ContingenciesThe Company is subject to audit or examination by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to tax matters. Income tax examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to the Company’s taxes or net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. Indirect tax examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to transaction taxes which may increase operating expenses. The Company establishes an accrued liability for loss contingencies related to tax matters when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. These accruals represent management’s best estimate of probable losses. 111Table of ContentsIn June 2019, His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) issued notices of determination and decisions that stated that, for the period October 2017 to April 2018, Sonder Europe Limited (“Sonder Europe”) incorrectly accounted for value added taxes (“VAT”) under the Tour Operators’ Margin Scheme (“TOMS”) for Sonder Europe’s leasing of residential apartments in the United Kingdom on long-term contracts and the subsequent short-term rental to travelers. In January 2023, Sonder Europe appealed to the First-Tier Tribunal Tax Chamber (the “FTT”) against HMRC’s notices. On July 5, 2023, the FTT delivered a ruling holding that supplies of accommodation made by Sonder Europe fell within the scope of the TOMS under the relevant VAT regulations. HMRC appealed the FTT’s ruling and on December 3, 2024, the appeal was heard in the Upper Tribunal. On January 14, 2025, the Upper Tribunal ruled that the FTT’s decision was wrong, and Sonder Europe was required to account for VAT on the full value of its supplies to travelers, rather than on the margin between the cost to Sonder Europe and the amount paid by travelers. The Company filed an appeal in March 2025. The Company recorded estimated accruals of $15.3 million and $6.8 million in the taxes payable line item of the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for such matters.Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact the Company’s tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the Company will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to the Company’s contingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements, and the range of possible outcomes is not currently estimable.IndemnificationsThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with all of its directors and executive officers. The indemnification agreements and the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) require the Company to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent not prohibited by Delaware law. Subject to certain limitations, the indemnification agreements and Bylaws also require the Company to advance expenses incurred. In addition, the Company entered into indemnification agreements with directors and officers of GMII in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination. These indemnification agreements provide these directors and officers with contractual rights to indemnification and advancement of certain expenses arising out of their service as directors and officers of GMII. The Company may be required to provide indemnification under the indemnification agreements or the Bylaws in relation to the legal proceedings described above in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no claims that management is aware of that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In the ordinary course of business, the Company has included limited indemnification provisions under certain agreements with parties with whom it has commercial relations of varying scope and terms with respect to certain matters, including losses arising out of its breach of such agreements or out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, no material costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with the Company’s indemnification provisions.112Table of ContentsNote 14.

Accordingly, the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. With the exception of operations in Canada and some countries in Europe and the Middle East, the Company’s foreign deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $9.4 million and $77.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had tax net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal, state, and foreign purposes of approximately $715.4 million, $561.6 million, and $226.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had tax net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal, state, and foreign purposes, and capital loss carryforwards for foreign purposes of approximately $612.4 million, $507.5 million, and $203.3 million, respectively.Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, $11.0 million will begin to expire in 2035, and $704.4 million will carry forward indefinitely. The state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027.Utilization of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss, tax credits, and disallowed business interest expense carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the U.S. Tax Code and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.Uncertain Tax PositionsThe Company has adopted authoritative guidance, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in its income tax return, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.The following is a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands): Year ended December 31,20242023Beginning balance$1,796 $1,520 Addition: tax positions related to prior years— 1 Addition: tax positions related to current year83 275 Subtraction: tax positions related to prior years(191)— Ending balance$1,688 $1,796 The Company files income tax returns in U.S. federal, various states, and international jurisdictions. All periods since inception are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, and foreign authorities, where applicable. The Company is under examination by the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) for the income tax returns filed for tax years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2022. As of December 31, 2024, the examination is on-going, and no proposed adjustments have been provided by the CRA. The Company is also under examination by France for the income tax returns filed for the tax years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. As of December 31, 2024, no tax assessments were made by the tax jurisdictions. There are currently no other pending income tax examinations. The Company’s 2021 through 2023 tax years remains subject to examination in the United States.On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was enacted in the U.S. The OBBBA includes significant provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, modifications to the international tax framework and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through 2027. We are currently assessing its impact on our consolidated financial statements.Note 15. Related Party TransactionsIn the year ended December 31, 2024, Francis Davidson, the Company’s former CEO and a former member of the Board participated in the August 2024 Preferred Financing with commitments of approximately $1.5 million. Mr. Davidson’s participation in the August 2024 Preferred Financing was approved by the Company’s Audit Committee pursuant to its 115Table of ContentsRelated Person Transaction Policy. The Company did not have any material related party transactions in the year ended December 31, 2023.Note 16. Restructuring ActivitiesIn March 2023, the Company announced a restructuring plan affecting approximately 14.0% of the corporate workforce. As part of this restructuring, the Company incurred $2.1 million in one-time restructuring costs, all of which were paid out in the year ended December 31, 2023.In February 2024, the Company announced a reduction in force plan affecting 106 corporate roles, or 17% of the corporate workforce, which is estimated to lead to approximately $11 million in annualized cost savings. We substantially completed these efforts during the first quarter of 2024. Total costs and cash expenditures were approximately $3.0 million, primarily related to employee severance and benefits costs, and were recognized and paid in the first quarter of 2024In April 2025, the Company completed a reduction in force with approximately $2.8 million in associated one-time restructuring costs, all of which are expected to be paid out in the year ended December 31, 2025.These restructuring costs are included in restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.Note 17. Subsequent EventsSecurities Purchase AgreementsOn April 11, 2025, the Company entered into the April 2025 Securities Purchase Agreements, with certain qualified institutional buyers or accredited investors (each a “April 2025 Purchaser” and, collectively, the “April 2025 Purchasers”) whereby the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 17.98 million shares (the “Preferred Shares”) of Series A Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of $1.00 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $17.98 million (such offering, the “April 2025 Preferred Financing”). The terms of the Preferred Shares are identical to the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.Under the April 2025 Securities Purchase Agreements, the April 2025 Purchasers each agreed that the Preferred Shares collectively will be immediately convertible into up to 19.99% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, on April 11, 2025. The April 2025 Securities Purchase Agreements require the Company to hold a special meeting of stockholders within 30 calendar days after the Company has filed this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the purpose of obtaining stockholder approval of a proposal to approve the issuance of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares in accordance with Rule 5635 of Nasdaq and, such proposal, the (“Nasdaq Proposal”) and a proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to 210,921,255 shares (the “Authorized Share Proposal” and, such approvals for the Nasdaq Proposal and the Authorized Share Proposal collectively, the “2025 Stockholder Approval”). Following receipt of 2025 Stockholder Approval, the Preferred Shares are fully convertible into shares of Common Stock and will vote on all applicable matters in accordance with the Certificate of Designation. The Company obtained the 2025 Stockholder Approval at the Special Meeting of Stockholders held on June 6, 2025 (the “2025 Special Meeting”).The April 2025 Securities Purchase Agreements also require the Company to file a registration statement under the Securities Act, within 30 calendar days of the filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to the resale of shares of common stock receivable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares.Francis Davidson, the Company’s former CEO and a former member on the Board, entered into an April 2025 Securities Purchase Agreement with the Company as part of the April 2025 Preferred Financing, pursuant to which Mr. Davidson purchased $595,000 in the April 2025 Preferred Financing. Mr. Davidson has agreed that he may not convert any of his Preferred Shares to common stock prior to the Company’s receipt of the 2025 Stockholder Approval.To the extent the April 2025 Purchasers do not already have such right, the April 2025 Securities Purchase Agreements grant the April 2025 Purchasers the right to purchase up to 25% of any Subsequent Financing until August 13, 2029. The April 2025 Purchasers are entitled to participate on a pro-rata basis (determined by their proportionate ownership of the common stock assuming conversion of their shares of Series A Preferred Stock) at a purchase price equal to 75% of the purchase price of any other investor in such Subsequent Financing.116Table of ContentsVoting Support AgreementIn connection with the April 2025 Preferred Financing, on April 11, 2025, the Company entered into an agreement with stockholders representing approximately 58% of the Company’s outstanding voting power prior to the April 2025 Preferred Financing (the “Voting Support Agreement”), pursuant to which the stockholder parties thereto agreed to, among other things, vote in favor of the Nasdaq Proposal, and the Authorized Share Proposal. The Voting Support Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms following the completion of the 2025 Special Meeting. Consent, Waiver and Sixth Amendment to Note and Warrant Purchase AgreementOn April 11, 2025, the Company entered into the Waiver, Consent and Sixth Amendment (the “NPA Amendment”), by and among the Company, the subsidiary note obligors party thereto (together with the Company, the “Note Obligors”), the subsidiary guarantors party thereto (the “Guarantors”), the investors party thereto (the “Investors”) and Alter Domus (US) LLC, as collateral agent (“Agent”), which modifies the Note Purchase Agreement, and the subordinated secured notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement (the “Notes”).Among other things, the NPA Amendment provides for (i) certain waivers in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the April 2025 Securities Purchase Agreements, (ii) the cancellation of an amount equal to 15% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and accrued but unpaid interest on the Notes as of the amendment date, (iii) a reduction in the interest rate applicable to the Notes, (iv) an extension of the option to pay interest in kind, and (v) amendments to certain covenants under the Note Purchase Agreement.In connection with the Company’s entrance into the NPA Amendment, the Company issued warrants to the Investors to purchase an aggregate of up to 5 million shares of the Common Stock at $1.00 per share (collectively, the “NPA Warrants”). Each NPA Warrant will become exercisable after the Company obtains the 2025 Stockholder Approval and will be exercisable thereafter until April 11, 2030. The exercise price of the NPA Warrants is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits, stock combinations, reorganizations or similar events affecting the Common Stock. Subject to limited exceptions, a holder of the NPA Warrants will not have the right to exercise any portion of its NPA Warrant if the holder (together with such holder’s affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together with such holder or any of such holder’s affiliates) would beneficially own a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of 4.99% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding. At the holder’s option, upon notice to the Company, the holder may increase or decrease this beneficial ownership limitation not to exceed 9.99% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, with any such increase becoming effective upon 61 days’ prior notice to the Company.Consent, Waiver and Sixth Amendment to 2022 Loan and Security AgreementOn April 11, 2025, the Company entered into the SVB Amendment.Among other things, the SVB Amendment provides for (i) certain waivers in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the April 2025 Securities Purchase Agreements, (ii) the reduction of the revolving line of credit from $60.0 million to $35.0 million and the reduction of the letter of credit sublimit from $45.0 million to $35.0 million, and (iii) amendments to certain of the covenants under the 2022 Loan and Security Agreement.Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or BylawsPrior to the consummation of the April 2025 Preferred Financing, on April 11, 2025, the holders of 70% of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock approved an amendment to the Certificate of Designation to increase the number of authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock from 43.30 million to 61.28 million, consented to the transactions contemplated by the April 2025 Securities Purchase Agreements and approved matters related to the April 2025 Preferred Financing and the issuance of the New Delayed Draw Warrants that were subject to certain provisions in the Certificate of Designation.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosuresNone.Item 9A. Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of the material weaknesses described below to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.Management’s Annual Report on Internal Controls Over Financial ReportingManagement, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.In designing and evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting, management recognizes that internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of internal controls over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible internal controls over financial reporting relative to their costs.Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria established in the COSO framework. Based on management’s evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that because of material weaknesses disclosed below, our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 was not effective.A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, believes the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly represent in all material respects our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The following are management’s identified material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting.LeasesWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting related to the control deficiencies in the process to capture and record lease agreements timely and accurately. Management has concluded that this material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting is due to the fact that the Company did not have the adequate resources with the appropriate level of experience and technical expertise to oversee the Company’s leasing business processes and related internal controls. This remains a material weakness as of December 31, 2024 as changes to the relevant controls did not operate for a sufficient period of time to evidence such controls to be operating effectively. 118Table of ContentsAsset ImpairmentWe previously identified a material weakness regarding the lack of design and effective controls to identify and consider relevant impairment indicators, determination of asset valuation, and possible impairment of assets, including right-of-use assets. This remains a material weakness as of December 31, 2024.Preferred StockWe identified a material weakness regarding management’s review of the preferred stock transactions entered into by the Company. Management’s review of the control was determined to not be at a level of precision sufficient enough to identify key metrics which impacted the valuation and accounting treatment under GAAP of the preferred stock. This remains a material weakness as of December 31, 2024.Control Activities, Control Environment and Information & CommunicationGiven the aggregation of the material weaknesses noted above and other control deficiencies, we have identified related COSO material weaknesses, including: (i) deficiencies in the principles associated with the control activities component of the COSO framework relating to establishment of formal policies and procedures and consistent application thereof, (ii) deficiencies in the principles associated with the control environment component of the COSO framework relating to hiring and training sufficient personnel to timely support the Company’s internal controls objectives to ascertain whether the components of internal controls are present and functioning, and (iii) deficiencies in the principles associated with the information and communication component of the COSO framework relating to the insufficient communication of relevant financial information between key functions within the Company resulting in certain transactions and events not being communicated in a timely manner to those responsible for preparing and reviewing our financial statements.Remediation PlansLeasesThroughout 2024, we onboarded new team members with a greater level of experience and technical expertise to oversee key areas of our finance function, such as accounting which includes the Company’s leasing business processes and related internal controls. We also implemented improvements related to our lease process to capture and record lease agreements timely and accurately and we provided additional training to personnel responsible for the relevant controls. However, our enhancements did not operate for a sufficient period of time in 2024 to allow a reasonable period of evaluation for remediation of this material weakness to be considered complete.To remediate our lease material weaknesses, we will continue to focus on hiring talent with an appropriate level of experience and technical expertise to oversee key areas of our finance function, which includes the performance of controls over the Company’s accounting for leases. We will also continue to implement control design changes related to our lease process to capture and record lease agreements timely and accurately, and provided additional training to personnel responsible for the relevant controls. Further, we will continue to invest in appropriate resources with the level of experience and technical expertise necessary to design and operate effectively internal controls over our accounting for leases.Control Activities, Control Environment and Information & CommunicationThroughout 2024, we implemented improvements related to our establishment of formal policies and procedures in addition to onboarding more sufficient personnel to support our internal control objectives. However, our enhancements did not operate for a sufficient period of time in 2024 to allow a reasonable period of evaluation for remediation of this material weakness to be considered complete.119Table of ContentsTo remediate our control activities and control environment material weaknesses, we have and are implementing improvements related to our establishment of formal policies and procedures in addition to hiring more sufficient personnel to support our internal control objectives. We will continue developing and maintaining policies and procedures. Additionally, we are committed to hiring sufficient personnel which are appropriate in both qualifications and experience for their relevant roles and improving collaboration between key functions within the Company to ensure timely and accurate reporting of financial matters. We have made notable progress in this area and will continue to evaluate our organization for areas of opportunity and further enhancement in 2025.Asset ImpairmentTo remediate our asset impairment material weakness, we have and are implementing control improvements for assessing and valuing asset impairments, particularly as they apply to our ROU lease assets and related items, including but not limited to the use of qualified, external subject matter professionals during our asset impairment process. We will continue to execute and evaluate operating effectiveness of adequate internal control over our asset impairment evaluation and valuation process.Preferred StockTo remediate our preferred stock material weakness, we have and are implementing control improvements by engaging resources at the Company with experience in performing control activities over complex and/or non-routine transactions, as well as utilizing third-party consultants and specialists. We will continue to execute and evaluate operating effectiveness of adequate internal control over our preferred stock evaluation and valuation process.As changes to the design and performance of controls are implemented, we will need a sufficient period of time to evaluate the operating effectiveness of such controls.Changes in Internal Controls over Financial ReportingOther than as discussed above, during the period covered by this report, there has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.120Table of ContentsItem 9B.

Executive CompensationAs a company operating in a highly competitive market at the intersection of the hospitality and technology industries, Sonder views its people as key drivers of its success. Sonder’s executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and motivate talented leaders, who enable us to succeed in a rapidly evolving competitive environment and achieve Sonder’s mission of making a world of better stays open to all. Sonder expects its executive team to demonstrate strong leadership and management capabilities and to strengthen its culture in order to achieve competitive advantage and speed of innovation.Sonder’s executive compensation program is oriented towards long-term retention and value creation objectives, and is structured to ensure that a significant portion of executive compensation is tied to performance and the delivery of stockholder value.Sonder’s executive compensation philosophy strives to achieve the following objectives:•Provide market-competitive compensation opportunities to attract, retain, and motivate high performing executives whose experience, skills, and impact are critical to our success;•Provide cash compensation (consisting of fixed base salary and variable annual bonus) and long-term equity awards (consisting time-based awards and at-risk performance-based awards) that encourage appropriate levels of risk-taking by the executive team and align their interests with those of the Company’s stakeholders; and•Ensure that Sonder’s compensation program is equitable for similarly-situated executives to drive collaboration towards achievement of its long-term business goals.This section provides an overview of Sonder’s executive compensation programs, including a narrative description of the material factors necessary to understand the information disclosed in the summary compensation table below.131Table of ContentsOn March 14, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Company determined, based on management’s recommendation, that the Company’s previously issued audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Financial Statements”), and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in each of the Company’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC in 2023 (collectively with the 2022 Annual Financial Statements, the “Affected Financial Statements”), should no longer be relied upon. The Affected Financial Statements were previously restated and the Company concluded that, after conducting a recovery analysis of incentive-based compensation received by the Company’s executive officers during the relevant recovery period, that no clawback of incentive-based compensation was required because such compensation was not based on a financial reporting metric affected by the Affected Financial Statements.

(3)    Mr. Davidson resigned from the Company effective June 24, 2025.(4)    Mr. Bourgault resigned from the Company effective December 2, 2024. The amount shown in the salary column for 2024 represents a partial year’s salary based on his December 2, 2024 end date. Mr. Bourgault’s annual salary was $495,000.(5)    Ms. Potter joined the Company as General Counsel and Secretary effective September 11, 2023. The amount shown in the salary column for 2023 represents a partial year’s salary based on her September 11, 2023 start date. Ms. Potter resigned from the Company effective November 22, 2024. The amount shown in the salary column for 2024 represents a partial year’s salary based on her November 22, 2024 termination date. Ms. Potter’s annual salary was $495,000.Base SalariesOur named executive officers receive base salaries to compensate them for services rendered to the Company. The base salary payable to each named executive officer is intended to provide a fixed component of compensation reflecting the executive’s skill set, experience, role, and responsibilities. The base salaries of our named executive officers are reviewed at least annually by the Compensation Committee and were increased in 2024 for each of our named executive officers, other than Mr. Davidson.Equity AwardsOur named executive officers participate in a long-term incentive plan (the “LTIP”) and are eligible to receive annual equity awards, which are critical to focusing our named executive officers on the Company’s long-term growth. Our equity awards for executive officers in 2024 were intended to be generally in the form of stock options, which typically have 132Table of Contentsvesting period of four years and vest on a monthly basis. Stock options granted to new hires typically have a vesting period of one year for 25% of the grant and terminate ten years after the grant date. Due to the Affected Financial Statements, the Company’s registration statement on Form S-8 for securities related to its employee incentive plans (the “Form S-8”) was no longer effective and could not be relied upon for the issuance of equity. Therefore, in April 2024, the Company suspended all exercises and purchases of Company securities under its equity plans, the issuance of shares of Company common stock pursuant to its equity plans, the settlement of any restricted stock units under its equity plans, and the grant of equity awards under its equity plans until the Company was able to use the Form S-8. Equity Award Timing Policies and ProceduresIn accordance with Item 402(x) of Regulation S-K, we are providing information regarding our procedures related to the grant of certain equity awards close in time to the release of MNPI. Although we do not have a formal policy, program, or plan that requires us to award equity or equity-based compensation on specific dates, we generally issue equity awards to our executive officers annually in the first quarter, and such awards are approved by our Compensation Committee during the first quarter. Additionally, our Insider Trading Policy prohibits directors, officers, and employees from trading in our securities while in possession of or on the basis of MNPI. We have not timed, and do not plan to time, the disclosure of MNPI for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.In the year ended December 31, 2024, no options were granted to our named executive officers within four business days prior to, or one business day following, the filing or furnishing of a periodic or current report by us that disclosed MNPI.2025 Executive Compensation Program UpdatesIn October 2024, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with its new independent compensation consultant, Ferguson Partners Consulting L.P. (“Ferguson”), began a process to review the Company’s executive compensation program, including to develop of an appropriate peer group, perform a market assessment of executive compensation, and assist in the development of updates to the Company’s executive compensation program. In March 2025, the Compensation Committee revised the executive compensation program by (i) adding an annual cash bonus plan (the “short-term incentive plan” or “STIP”) and (ii) revising the LTIP, as described in greater detail below. The base salaries for certain for our named executive officers were also increased by the Compensation Committee, in consultation with Ferguson, in order to better align with the market practices of companies in the Company’s peer group as follows: Mr. Davidson to $550,000 and Mr. Picard to $480,000. The STIP is designed to motivate and reward our executives, including our named executive officers, for achievements relative to the Company’s goals and expectations for each fiscal year. The STIP for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025 was approved in the spring of 2025 by the Compensation Committee. Each named executive officer has a target bonus opportunity, defined as a dollar amount and tied to certain pre-determined metrics established by the Compensation Committee. Following the end of the year, our Compensation Committee will determine the cash bonus (if any) for our executives, including our named executive officers, based on company performance against the pre-determined metrics, and retains discretion to allow for individual adjustments, based on such factors as it deems appropriate. The target bonus amounts for our named executive officers is $360,000 for Mr. Picard and was, prior to his termination of employment, $550,000 for Mr. Davidson.At the beginning of 2025, the LTIP was revised to grant equity awards in the form of performance stock units (“PSUs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to executive officers based on certain pre-determined metrics and related vesting criteria. The LTIP awards for our named executive officers for 2025, expressed as a percentage of the total equity award, were 80% PSUs and 20% RSUs for Mr. Davidson, and 70% PSUs and 30% RSUs for Mr. Picard. The PSUs are subject to pre-determined performance metrics consisting of strategic and financial goals and related vesting criteria. The number of PSUs that will be eligible to vest will be determined upon the Compensation Committee’s certification of achievement of the applicable metrics and criteria. The RSUs are subject to time-vesting conditions and generally vest 1/3 per year subject to the recipient continuing to provide services. In March 2025, the Company granted (i) Mr. Davidson 2,243,747 PSUs (at target) and 560,937 RSUs and (ii) Mr. Picard 1,096,227 PSUs (at target) and 469,811 RSUs. Mr. Hughes’ compensation has not been revised since his appointment as the Chief Financial Officer. 133Table of ContentsOn June 24, 2025, Sonder and Mr. Davidson entered into a Separation Agreement and Release pursuant to which Mr. Davidson resigned as director and Chief Executive Officer of Sonder, as described in greater detail in the section below entitled, “Named Executive Officer Employment Agreements.”Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-EndThe following table sets forth information regarding outstanding equity awards held by our named executive officers as of December 31, 2024:134Table of ContentsOption Awards(1)(2)Stock AwardsNameNumber of Securities Underlying Unexercised Options Exercisable (#)Number of Securities Underlying Unexercised Options Unexercisable (#)Option Exercise Price ($)Option Expiration DateNumber of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested (#)Market Value of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested ($)(3)Equity Incentive Plan Awards: Number of Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested(4)Equity Incentive Plan Awards: Market or Payout Value of Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested ($)(3)Francis Davidson— 236,431 (5)(6)$34.80 (7)2/19/203174,942 (8)$238,316— — 54,599 70,400 (9)18.09(10)3/16/2033— — 464,999$1,478,697Dominique Bourgault57,105 — (11)18.00(10)3/16/2033— — — — 1,950 — (12)7.40(10)9/12/2033— — — — Martin Picard1,287 — (13)13.40(14)8/3/2027— — 158,997 $1,239,9951,415 — (15)13.40(14)11/9/2027— — — — 8,254 — (16)27.80(14)1/28/2029— — — — 12,162 — (17)27.80(14)1/28/2029— — — — 7 — (18)27.80(14)1/28/2029— — — — 77 — (19)27.80(14)1/28/2029— — — — 3 — (20)57.00(14)11/15/2029— — — — 8,879 — (5)(21)34.80(7)2/7/2030— — — — 68 — (5)(22)34.80(7)2/7/2030— — — — 74 — (5)(23)34.80(7)6/18/2030— — — — 3,088 — (5)(24)34.80(7)11/5/2030— — — — 11,644 525 (5)(25)34.80(7)2/19/2031— — — — 941 217 (5)(26)34.80(7)11/11/2031— — — — 30,541 21,886 (5)(27)34.80(7)8/16/2032— — — — 21,840 28,159 (28)18.00(10)3/16/2033— — — — 1,950 4,300 (29)7.40(10)9/12/2033— — — — Katherine E.

The Severance Plans provide for the payment of specified severance pay and other benefits to eligible participants who incur qualifying terminations of employment and satisfy the terms and conditions of the Severance Plans.The 2023 Severance Plan applies to eligible participants on or after May 1, 2023, including Ms. Potter and Mr. Hughes. The 2021 Severance Plan applies to eligible participants prior to May 1, 2023, including Messrs. Davidson, Bourgault, and Picard.

The Severance Benefits are subject to a qualifying termination of employment and an effective separation and release of claims agreement.Employee Benefit PlansOur named executive officers are entitled to participate in our equity incentive plans and are eligible to participate in our 401(k) plan on the same terms as all other employees. We do not maintain any supplemental health or welfare plans for our named executive officers.Director CompensationOur directors play a critical role in guiding our strategic direction and overseeing the management of Sonder. The many responsibilities and risks and the substantial time commitment of being a director require that we provide adequate compensation commensurate with our directors’ workload and opportunity costs.Directors who are employees of the Company do not receive additional compensation for their service as directors. The Board has adopted a compensation policy that governs the cash and equity compensation for our non-employee directors, which was amended in September 2023, May 2024, and December 2024 (as amended from time to time, the “Outside Director Compensation Policy”). The Outside Director Compensation Policy was developed with input from independent compensation consultants regarding practices and compensation levels at comparable companies and is designed to attract, retain, and reward non-employee directors. Under the Outside Director Compensation Policy, each of our non-employee directors receives the cash and equity compensation for services described below. We also reimburse our non-employee directors for reasonable, customary, and documented travel expenses to Board or committee meetings.The Outside Director Compensation Policy provides for a maximum annual limit of $750,000 of aggregate compensation (cash retainers, fees, and equity awards) that may be paid, issued, or granted to a non-employee director in any fiscal year, and this limit is increased to $1,000,000 in an individual’s first year of service as a non-employee director. For purposes of this limitation, the value of equity awards is based on the grant date fair value (determined in accordance with GAAP). Any cash compensation paid or equity awards granted to a person for their services as an employee, or for their services as a consultant (other than as a non-employee director), does not count towards such limitation. The maximum limit does not reflect the intended size of any potential compensation or equity awards to our non-employee directors.The Outside Director Compensation Policy has been amended as follows:•September 2023 - reduced the grant date fair value of an initial award of RSUs (the “Initial Award”) from $320,000 to $160,000. •May 2024 - increased the annual cash retainer payable to the Lead Independent Director from $15,000 to $35,000.•December 2024 - (i) increased the annual cash retainer payable to each non-employee director from $35,000 to $65,000, (ii) removed the annual cash retainer payable to members of the committees, (iii) increased the annual cash retainer payable to the Board Chair (previously the Independent Lead Director) from $35,000 to $50,000, (iv) increased the annual cash retainer payable to the chair of each committee, (v) established the annual cash retainer payable to the Investment Committee Chair as $20,000, (vi) reduced the grant date fair value of the Annual Award (as described below) from $160,000 to $125,000, and (vii) removed the Initial Award.139Table of ContentsCash CompensationOur non-employee directors are entitled to receive the following in cash compensation for their services under the Outside Director Compensation Policy:•$65,000 per year for service as a board member;•$50,000 per year for service as a board chair ($35,000 for service as the Independent Lead Director per year prior to December 31, 2024);•$25,000 per year for service as chair of the Audit Committee;•$20,000 per year for service as chair of the Compensation Committee ($12,000 per year prior to December 31, 2024);•$20,000 per year for service as chair of the Investment Committee; •$15,000 per year for service as chair of the Nominating Committee ($8,000 per year prior to December 31, 2024); and•$1,500 per year for each meeting to the extent the Board or any of its committees meets more than eight times per year.All cash payments to non-employee directors are paid quarterly in arrears on a pro-rated basis.Equity CompensationAnnual AwardEach non-employee director, other than the excluded directors and the Board Chair, automatically receives, on the date of each annual meeting of our stockholders, an annual award of restricted stock units (an “Annual Award”) covering a number of shares of our Common Stock having a grant date fair value (determined in accordance with GAAP) of $125,000; provided that the first Annual Award granted to an individual following his or her initial election to the Board as a non-employee director will have a grant date fair value equal to the product of (A) $125,000 multiplied by (B) a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is equal to the number of calendar months in which the non-employee director first became a non-employee director and ending with the calendar month in which the first annual meeting following such calendar month occurs, and (ii) the denominator of which is 12; and provided further that any resulting fraction will be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The Board Chair will be granted an Annual Award covering a number of shares of our Common Stock having a grant date fair value (determined in accordance with GAAP) of $175,000. Each Annual Award will be scheduled to vest in full on the earlier of (i) the one-year anniversary of the grant date, or (ii) the date of the next annual meeting of our stockholders following the grant date, in each case, subject to the non-employee director continuing to be a non-employee director through the applicable vesting date. A non-employee director that is not independent in accordance with the applicable rules of the Nasdaq and the SEC will be paid fifty percent of the equity compensation such non-employee director would otherwise receive.In the event of a “change in control” (as defined in the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan), each non-employee director will fully vest in their outstanding company equity awards immediately prior to the consummation of the change in control, provided that the non-employee director continues to be a non-employee director through such date.2024 Director Compensation TableThe following table lists actual compensation paid to each of our non-employee directors for the year ended December 31, 2024. Mr. Davidson, our former CEO, did not receive additional compensation for his service as a director. All compensation paid to Mr. Davidson is reported in the “Summary Compensation Table” appearing earlier in this Annual Report.Due to the Affected Financial Statements, the Company’s Form S-8 was no longer effective and could not be relied upon for the issuance of equity. Therefore, our non-employee directors did not receive any equity awards in the year ended December 31, 2024. 140Table of ContentsName(1)Fees Earned or Paid in Cash ($)(2)Total ($)Nabeel Hyatt(3)$—$—Frits Dirk van Paasschen$48,738$48,738Janice Sears$82,230$82,230Michelle Frymire$73,765$73,765Prashant (Sean) Aggarwal$51,230$51,230Sanjay Banker$35,000$35,000Simon Turner$45,131$45,131(1)    Each non-employee director had the following number of options and/or RSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2024:NameOptions (#)RSUs (#)Nabeel Hyatt——Frits Dirk van Paasschen10,42412,517Janice Sears—13,104Michelle Frymire—15,193Prashant (Sean) Aggarwal—15,031Sanjay Banker—14,656Simon Turner—26,622(2)    Includes annual retainer, committee and chair fees and the lead independent director fee paid to our non-employee directors under the Outside Director Compensation Policy.

For purposes of the Related Person Transaction Policy, a “related person transaction” is a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) or any proposed transaction, arrangement or relationship, in which the Company is a participant and in which any “related person” has, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest (as contemplated by Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act) and the aggregate amount involved exceeds One Hundred Twenty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($120,000).Transactions involving compensation for services provided to the Company as an employee, consultant or director will not be considered related person transactions under this policy. For purposes of the Company’s policy, a related person is (i) any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of the Company’s last fiscal year was, a director or executive officer of the Company; (ii) nominees for director of the Company; (iii) any person or entity known by the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent (5%) of any class of the Company’s voting securities (each, a “5% Stockholder”); (iv) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing; or (v) affiliates of the Company (i.e., subsidiaries).Under the Related Person Transaction Policy, each of the Company’s directors and executive officers (and, to the extent that they are otherwise employed by or affiliated with the Company, 5% Stockholders) will inform the Company’s General Counsel or their designee of any potential related person transactions of which they become aware. The Audit Committee will review (with management) on a periodic basis, and no less than quarterly, (i) any proposed related person transactions, 146Table of Contentsor (ii) any related person transactions of which they have become aware and which have not previously been approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee’s review will include, in each case, the terms, business purposes and proposed value of such transactions. After review, the Audit Committee will approve, ratify or disapprove such transactions. In certain limited situations the Chairperson of the Audit Committee may review and approve related person transactions if the aggregate amount involved in any such transaction, or series of related transactions, is expected to be less than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($250,000). Any such approval will be reported to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.To identify related person transactions in advance, the Company will rely on information supplied by the Company’s executive officers, directors, and certain significant stockholders.In considering related person transactions, the Audit Committee will take into account the following factors, to the extent relevant to the related person transaction:•whether the related person transaction is fair to the Company and on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances;•the extent of the related person’s interest in the transaction;•whether there are business reasons for the Company to enter into the related person transaction;•whether the related person transaction would impair the independence of an outside director, including the ability of any director to serve on a committee of the Board; and•whether the related person transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any director or executive officer of the Company, taking into account the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of the director, executive officer or Related Person, the direct or indirect nature of the director’s, executive officer’s or related person’s interest in the transaction and the ongoing nature of any proposed relationship, and any other factors the Audit Committee deems relevant.The Related Person Transaction Policy grants standing pre-approval of certain transactions, including (1) certain compensation arrangements for our directors or executive officers, (2) transactions with another company at which a related person’s only relationship is as a non-executive employee, director or beneficial owner of less than 10% of that company’s shares, provided that the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of $1,000,000 or 2% of such company’s total annual revenues and the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to unaffiliated third parties under the same or similar circumstances, (3) charitable contributions by us to a charitable organization, foundation or university at which a related person’s only relationship is as a non-executive employee or director, provided that the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of $1,000,000 or 2% of such organization’s total annual receipts, (4) transactions where a related person’s interest arises solely from the ownership of our common stock and all holders of our common stock received the same benefit on a pro rata basis, and (5) any indemnification or advancement of expenses made pursuant to our organizational documents or any agreement. In addition to our Related Person Transaction Policy, our Audit Committee charter provides that our Audit Committee shall review and approve or disapprove any related person transactions.Director IndependenceThe Board has affirmatively determined that all of our directors, other than Messrs. Banker and Davidson due to their status as employees or former employees of the Company, have no relationship with the Company that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that such individuals are independent directors within the meaning of the applicable Nasdaq listing standards and relevant securities and other laws, rules and regulations regarding the definition of “independent” (the “Independent Directors”). All members of the Audit Committee, the Nominating Committee, and the Compensation Committee are Independent Directors.Item 14.
