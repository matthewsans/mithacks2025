(the “Company”) is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A (“Amendment No. 1”) to amend the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, which was initially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 12, 2025 (the “Original 2024 Form 10-K”). The purpose of this Amendment No. 1 is to correct Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of the Company’s Original 2024 Form 10-K, which inadvertently omitted a statement disclosing the conclusions of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. This Amendment No. 1 corrects such omission and amends and replaces Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of the Original 2024 Form 10-K in its entirety.In addition, pursuant to Rule 12b-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), this Amendment No. 1 also contains new certifications pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which are attached hereto.Except as described above, this Amendment No. 1 does not amend, modify, or otherwise update any other information in the Original 2024 Form 10-K and does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the Original 2024 Form 10-K. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 1 should be read in conjunction with the Original 2024 Form 10-K and the Company’s other filings with the SEC.1PART II Item 9A.    Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), has evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2024. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed, operated and managed, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Because of the inherent limitations of disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, using the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) . Based on that assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 based on those criteria.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the year ended December 31, 2024 other than items described below related to our remediation actions, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Remediation of Prior Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingAs of December 31, 2023, our management identified and disclosed a material weakness in the design and operation of a management review control over prospective financial information used in the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment, and specifically, not sufficiently performing and documenting the reasonableness of significant assumptions used therein.During 2024, our management was actively engaged in remediation efforts to address the material weakness noted above.
The Company implemented the following improvements:•The design, including the precision, of the management review control over the significant assumptions used to prepare the prospective financial information used in the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment was updated to ensure the sufficiency of the control procedures.
Specifically, the procedures over the significant assumptions are appropriately detailed to allow management to assess the operating effectiveness of the control. •Sufficient documentation was prepared, reviewed and retained over the Company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment performed as of October 1, 2024.Based on the actions taken and the testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management has concluded the material weakness identified in the prior year no longer existed as of December 31, 2024.The independent registered public accounting firm of Ernst & Young LLP, as auditors of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, included herein.2PART IV Item 15.    Exhibits and Financial Statement SchedulesSee Exhibit Index at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, which is incorporated by reference.EXHIBIT INDEXExhibit No.Description of Exhibit31.3*Certification of the Principal Executive Officer Required Under Rules 13a-14(a) and 15d-14(a) of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, as adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 200231.4*Certification of the Principal Financial Officer Required Under Rules 13a-14(a) and 15d-14(a) of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, as adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002104*Cover Page Interactive Data File (formatted as Inline XBRL and contained in Exhibit 101)* Filed herewith.3SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirement of Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
