EXPLANATORY NOTE
Madison Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”)
is restating its previously issued audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, in
the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Restatement”). The Restatement results from the identification of errors
related to the accounting for revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and reclassification of the presentation of certain operating
costs and expenses of continuing operations and discontinued operations. The restatement also includes previously unrecorded adjustments,
including out of period errors, being recorded in the correct accounting period. Impacts for periods prior to 2022 have been accumulated
and presented as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of December 31, 2021.
The Company has assessed the materiality
of these errors in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99 (“SAB”),
Materiality and SAB No. 108, Quantifying Financial Statement Misstatements, and has concluded that the errors are material to the
financial statements and therefore the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 should
be restated.
For a more detailed description of the
financial impact of the restatement, see Note 2 - Correction of Errors in Previously Reported 2022 Annual Financial Statements
included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Summary
Madison
Technologies Inc. (“Madison” or the “Company” or “we” or “us” or “our”)
is a Nevada corporation that was incorporated on June 15, 1998.
Madison
Technologies Inc. is seeking to create, develop and launch BlockchainTV (“BCTV”), the first-to-market 24/7 television
broadcast and streaming communications network designed to bring the most up-to-date cryptocurrency information and entertainment
to the masses in the U.S. and around the world.
We
believe there is an information void in the blockchain global community where there is no credible, reliable and unbiased source
for the most up-to-date information. We created BCTV to fill that void with a live broadcast network and distribution platform
to deliver unbiased information in the global blockchain marketplace. We intend for BCTV to engage with viewers by bringing experts,
entrepreneurs and entertainment programming into their living rooms and on their devices with a focus on unpacking trends, separating
fact from fiction and providing insight into the volatile global marketplace.
The
BCTV live news programming will be delivered by a team of anchors who will provide breaking news, in-depth stories and interviews
around the clock in studio settings and on location through contributing journalists. Our vision is to broadcast BCTV initially
from Niagara Falls in Ontario, Canada and to expand our broadcast locations to markets with relatively large numbers of people
and businesses connected to the cryptocurrency marketplace.
Product
and Services
To
achieve the North American rollout, we are focusing on strategic partnerships and distribution deals that deliver BCTV to households
through over-the-air television stations, through television distributors and through alternative distribution platforms such
as Roku, Hulu, YouTube, Pluto and Xumo.
The
core revenue streams envisioned for BCTV media content would be generated by selling advertising and sponsorships. We seek to
supplement core revenues by transacting through e-commerce with our audience. Building, growing and knowing your audience is a
significant factor in developing core and supplemental revenues.

Recent
Developments
On
February 17, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with funds affiliated with Arena Investors, LP (collectively,
the “Investors”) pursuant to which we issued convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.5 million for
an aggregate purchase price of $15 million (collectively, the “Notes”). We used proceeds from the Notes to acquire
KNET and KNLA, Class A television stations in Los Angeles, California, KVVV, a low power television station in Houston, Texas,
and KYMU-LD, a low power television station in Seattle, Washington. The Notes accrued interest at a rate of 11% per annum, subject
to increase to 20% per annum upon and during the occurrence of an event of default. We did not make the $0.4 million interest
payments on the Notes that were due on April 1, 2022, July 1, 2022, October 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, and accrued default
interest accordingly. The Notes were secured by a blanket lien on all of the Company’s assets and the shares of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (“Common Stock”) and the Company’s preferred stock, par value $0.001
per share (collectively, the “Pledged Assets”), held by Philip Falcone, FFO 1 2021 Irrevocable Trust (“FFO1”),
FFO 2 2021 Irrevocable Trust (“FFO2”) and Korr Value LP (collectively, the “Pledgors”), which shares the
Investors had been granted the right to vote in the event of default.
On
January 28, 2023, Arena Investors, LP (“Arena”), in its capacity as the agent (the “Agent”) for the Investors
delivered a notice to us (the “Acceleration Notice”), which stated that the Agent and the Investors (a) elected to
cause the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest, liquidated damages and other amounts owing
in respect thereof, to become immediately due and payable in cash, (b) intended to commence legal action to collect any or all
of the amounts due under the Notes, and (c) sought the appointment of a receiver or trustee as a means of realizing proceeds on
their collateral.
On
September 21, 2023, the Agent for the Investors delivered a notice to us that the Agent exercised the Investors’ rights
to vote the Pledged Interests (as defined in such notice) and to exercise the Pledgees’ rights, powers and privileges, to
pass certain resolutions and to amend our then-existing bylaws to, among other things, (i) remove the board of directors of the
Company (the “Board of Directors”) and all officers of the Company, and (ii) reduce the number of the Board of Directors
from three directors to one director. As a result of the Agent delivering such notice and exercising its rights to vote the Pledged
Interests, a change of control of the Company occurred (the “Change of Control”).
On
November 6, 2023, the shareholders of the Company removed Philip Falcone and Warren Zenna from the Board of Directors and appointed
Thomas Amon as the sole member of the Board of Directors. Mr. Amon removed all of the Company’s then-serving officers and
appointed himself as the Company’s President, Secretary, Treasurer, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer.
As
of the date of this Annual Report and since the last day of the year ended December 31, 2022, we have not been able to timely
repay certain of our other outstanding debt obligations in addition to those obligations to Arena and Z4 described above, with
an aggregate of approximately $3.5 million currently in default, including accrued interest, default interest and late fees. As
a result of the Change of Control, we intend to strategize with the holders of such notes to extend, modify or otherwise revisit
the terms of such indebtedness in order to resolve such outstanding defaults.
Since
October 2023, and as a result of the Change of Control, we have had minimal operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely
of cash. However, in December 2023, we held discussions with the head of content production of BCTV regarding initial plans to
continue the Company’s business plans described above as intended prior to the Change of Control. However, we cannot make
any guarantee as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (this
“Annual Report”) as to the timing and success of these plans, business relationships or reaching any self-imposed
expectations, or that we will ultimately continue the Company’s business as so described. See “Cautionary Note Regarding
Future Looking Statements”.
Discontinued
Operations
On
February 1, 2023, we entered into a Partial Strict Foreclosure Agreement with the Investors, pursuant to which we transferred
ownership of our Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) licenses and other broadcast television assets associated
with the broadcast television business of SovRyn Holdings, Inc (“Sovryn”), then our subsidiary, to a third-party entity
controlled by the Investors (the “Partial Foreclosure Agreement”). In consideration therefor, the Investors agreed
to reduce the indebtedness under the Notes by $9,159,907. As a result, the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of Sovryn
ceased as of January 31, 2023 and were deemed discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
Competitive
Conditions
Through
our BCTV content, we intend to compete for viewership in a marketplace that is fragmented and niche. Major media organizations
such as Bloomberg and Comcast, which operate CNBC and MSNBC, respectively, deliver content about cryptocurrencies, but none have
a dedicated source for viewers to continuously consume that content.
Dependence
on Customers
Currently,
we are not, and plan not to be, dependent on one or a few major customers. Our business is designed to generate revenue from four
primary categories of customers: (1) advertisers and sponsors of our BCTV content airing on our broadcast over-the-air content
distribution platform (the “OTA Platform”), applications and websites, as well as through third-party broadcasters,
cable television operators, and alternative video distribution platforms, such as YouTube, Roku, Pluto and Xumo; (2) viewers of
our BCTV content, who form the audience that attracts advertisers and sponsors; and (3) third-party networks that lease channels
on our OTA Platform.
2
Technology
and Intellectual Property
We
do not currently own any patents, trademarks or other intellectual property.
Governmental
and Industry Regulations
Broadcast
licenses are issued by and subject to the rules and regulations of the FCC, pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC
regulates broadcasting businesses and has the authority to issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcast licenses and impose penalties
for the violation of its regulations. In the event we continue to conduct our business in the same manner prior the Change of
Control, we would potentially be subject to FCC rules and regulations. In order to obtain, renew, assign or modify a license,
purchase a new station or sell an existing station, we must obtain approval from the FCC.
Depending
on our anticipated and future operations, we expect to continue to be subject to other federal and state laws and regulations
that relate directly or indirectly to our operations, including federal securities laws. We are also subject to common business
and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of our business.
Research
and Development Activities and Costs
We
have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date.
Compliance
with Environmental Laws
Our
current operations are not subject to any environmental laws.
Facilities
Our
principal executive office, at which minimal operations are conducted and which we do not own or lease, is located at 2500 Westchester
Avenue, Suite 401, Purchase, New York.
Number
of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees
We
have one employee who serves as our President, Secretary, Treasurer, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Principal
Accounting Officer.

Item
1A. Risk Factors.
Our
business involves significant risks, some of which are described below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties
described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below
are not the only ones we face. Additional risk and uncertainties of which we are unaware or that we deem immaterial may also become
important factors that adversely affect our business. The realization of any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material
adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, growth and future prospects as well as
our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. In that event, the market price of our Common Stock could decline and you
could lose part or all of your investment.
Risks
Related to Our Business
We
have a history of losses, have not been profitable historically and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.
We
have a history of losses. Our ability to forecast our future operating results is subject to a number of uncertainties, including
our ability to plan for and model future growth. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently
experienced by growing companies in rapidly evolving industries. If our assumptions regarding these uncertainties, which we use
to plan our business, are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully,
our operating and financial results could differ materially from expectations, our business could suffer and the trading price
of our stock may decline.
We have incurred net losses of $5.3 million
and $12.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had accumulated deficit
of $28.9 million.
We
are not certain whether or when we will obtain a high enough volume of sales of our products and services to sustain or increase
our growth or achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We expect our costs to increase in future periods, which could
negatively affect our future operating results if our revenue does not increase. In particular, we may, among other things, expend
substantial financial and other resources on:
●
content production
related to BCTV, including investments in expanding our content and production teams;
●
sales and marketing, including a significant
expansion of our sales organization;
●
continued expansion of our business into adjacent
geographic markets;
●
re-establishing our business operations after
the Change of Control; and
●
general administration expenses, including legal
and accounting expenses related to being a public company.
These
investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. If we are unable to increase our revenue at a rate
sufficient to offset the expected increase in our costs, our business, financial position and results of operations will be harmed,
and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability over the long term. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating
expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If our revenue
growth does not meet our expectations in future periods, our financial performance may be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve
or maintain profitability in the future.
4
We
have incurred debt in connection with our acquisitions of television station assets, some of which is currently in default, and
this has and may continue to materially and adversely affect our financial condition and could restrict our operating flexibility.
In
connection with our planned launch of BCTV, we issued promissory and convertible notes that include negative covenants that restrict
our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; create liens or other encumbrances on assets; make loans, guarantees,
investments and acquisitions; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; make negative pledges; enter into affiliate transactions; and
make cash distributions to our stockholders.
In
January 2023, outstanding principal amounts under the Notes of not less than $16.5 million were accelerated by Arena in its capacity
as Agent due to the occurrence of certain events of default under the Notes, which ultimately resulted in the Change of Control.
On
November 10, 2023, Philip Falcone, individually and on behalf of Madison and other named defendants, filed a Confession of Judgment
affirming that a promissory note (the “Z4 Note”) had been issued by the Company, dated December 28, 2021, by Z4 Mgmt.
LLC (“Z4”), which was guaranteed by each of FFO1 and FFO2. The Z4 Note was initially payable on February 15, 2022,
and had an original principal balance of $500,000 with an interest rate of 12% per annum. The Z4 Note’s expiration date
was extended to July 5, 2022, then further extended to March 31, 2023, and as of October 1, 2023, the revised principal balance,
along with interest accrued, totaled $581,304. On such date, Z4 filed an Affidavit of Default affirming that the Z4 Note was in
default and requesting a judgment in the amount of $581,304 against the Company, FFO1, FFO2, and Mr. Falcone personally, in favor
of Z4. On December 5, 2023, a judgement in favor Z4 in the sum of $581,304 was rendered against us, Mr. Falcone, FFO1 and FFO2.
In
addition to the defaults described above, as of the date of this Annual Report, and since the last day of the year ended December
31, 2023, we are in default under a certain loans payable for failure to pay principal and accrued interest on such loans, with
an aggregate of approximately $4.6 million and $4.1 million of principal, accrued interest and late fees, as of such date and
as of December 31, 2022, respectively. We have not yet made principal and interest payments on such notes when due and as a result,
under terms of the notes, the interest rate is as much as 22% per annum. As a result of the Change of Control, we intend to strategize
with the holders of such notes to extend, modify or otherwise revisit the terms of such indebtedness in order to resolve such
outstanding defaults.
Such
convertible notes and related obligations, including interest payments, covenants and restrictions, had and could have in the
future important consequences, including the following:
●
reserving cash in
order to satisfy the obligations relating to such notes could adversely affect the amount or timing of investments to grow
our business, impairing our ability to invest in and successfully grow our business;
●
limit our ability
to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
debt obligations and other general corporate requirements;
●
result in foreclosure
of certain pledged assets pursuant to such notes;
●
increase our vulnerability
to general economic downturns, competition and industry conditions and we may be unable to take advantage of opportunities
that our leverage prevents us from exploiting, placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors that are less leveraged; and
●
impose restrictions
on the manner in which we conduct our business, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt
and sell assets.
The
obligations under such promissory and convertible notes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
operating results or cash flows. In addition, our failure to comply with the covenants under such convertible notes could result
in an event of default and acceleration of the outstanding balance, which could significantly harm our business and cause our
stock price to decline.
Our
products may never achieve market acceptance.
Our
ability to generate revenues from sales of our products and services and to achieve profitability will depend upon our ability
to successfully commercialize such products and services. Because we have not yet begun to offer any of our products or services
for sale, we have no basis to predict whether any of our products or services will achieve market acceptance. A number of factors
may limit the market acceptance of any of our products or services, including:
●
the competitive
features of our products and services, including price, as compared to other similar products and services;
●
the extent and success
of our marketing efforts and those of our collaborators;
●
unfavorable publicity
concerning our products or similar products; and
●
the timing of regulatory
approvals of our products or services and market entry compared to competitive products.
If
we are unable to attract viewers or acquire customers, our future revenues and operating results will be harmed. Likewise, potential
customer turnover in the future, or costs we incur to retain our existing customers, could materially and adversely affect our
financial performance.
Our
success depends on our ability to acquire new customers in new and existing vertical markets, and in new and existing geographic
markets. If we are unable to attract a sufficient number of new customers, we may be unable to generate revenue growth at desired
rates. The markets in which we now and may in the future operate are competitive and many of our competitors have substantial
financial, personnel and other resources that they utilize to develop solutions and attract viewers and customers. As a result,
it may be difficult for us to add new viewers and customers to our base. Competition in the marketplace may also lead us to attract
fewer new viewers and customers or result in us providing discounts and other commercial incentives. Additional factors that impact
our ability to acquire new viewers or customers include keeping pace with technological developments, including with respect to
production and programming capabilities, network and information systems and the utility of our OTA Platform, as well as general
economic conditions. These factors may have a meaningful negative impact on future revenues and operating results.
5
If
we are unable to sell services to our customers and grow our customer retention rates, our future revenue and operating results
may be harmed.
Our
future success depends, in part, on our ability to deploy our services to viewers and other customers. This may require increasingly
sophisticated and costly sales efforts and may not result in any sales. In addition, the rate at which our customers purchase
our services may depends on a number of factors, including the perceived need for additional TV entertainment, information and
other content as well as general economic conditions. If our efforts to sell our services to such viewers and customers are not
successful, our business may suffer.
Our
business model is predicated, in part, on building a customer base that will generate a recurring stream of revenue. If such revenue
stream does not develop as expected, or if our business model changes as the broadcasting industry evolves, our operating results
may be adversely affected.
Our
business model is dependent, in part, on our ability to maintain and increase distribution to generate recurring revenues. Our
customers may not utilize our television broadcast assets at the same rate at which we intend them to do currently. If our customers
are to reduce their utilization, our recurring revenue stream relative to our total revenues would be reduced and our operating
results would be adversely affected.
Fluctuating
economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating
results.
Our
revenue depends significantly on general economic conditions. Economic weakness and customer financial difficulties may result
in decreased revenue and earnings. Such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast our sales and operating results
and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts of our costs and expenses. General economic weakness may
also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers, an increase in customer bad debt, restructuring initiatives
and associated expenses and impairment of investments.
Uncertainty
about future economic conditions also makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments.
Future or continued economic weakness for us or our customers, failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness
and customer financial difficulties could have a material adverse effect on demand, and consequently on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Our
brand, reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our customers will be dependent in part upon the reliable performance
of our products and infrastructure.
Our
brand, reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our customers will be dependent in part upon the reliable performance
of, and the ability of our customers to access and use our television broadcast assets. We may in the future experience disruptions,
outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, equipment failure, human
or software errors, capacity constraints, and fraud or cybersecurity attacks. In some instances, we may not be able to identify
the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time.
Interruptions
in our systems or the third-party systems on which we rely, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic
break-ins, or other factors, could affect the security or availability of our television broadcast assets, network infrastructure,
cloud infrastructure and website.
Problems
with the reliability or security of our systems could harm our reputation. Damage to our reputation and the cost of remedying
these problems could negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
Any
disruptions or other performance problems with our television broadcast assets could harm our reputation and business and may
damage our customers’ businesses. Interruptions in our service delivery might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits
to customers, subject us to potential liability and cause customers not to renew any subscriptions that we may offer.
6
If
we are not able to position our brand or reputation as an industry leader, our business and operating results may be adversely
affected.
We
believe that if we position ourselves as the leader in next-generation television, it will help build relationships with our end-user
customers and our ability to attract customers and reseller partners. The successful promotion of our brand will depend on multiple
factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to deliver a superior customer experience and develop high-quality
features and our ability to successfully differentiate our broadcast services from those of our competitors. Our brand promotion
activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. The promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures,
and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive, and as we expand into new geographies
and vertical markets. To the extent that these activities yield increased revenue; this revenue may not offset the increased expenses
we incur. If we do not successfully position our brand and reputation as an industry leader, our business and operating results
may be adversely affected.
We
are dependent on the continued services and performance of Thomas Amon and other key employees we intend to hire in the future,
as well as on our ability to successfully hire, train, manage and retain qualified personnel.
Our
future performance depends on the continued services and contributions of Thomas Amon, our President, Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations.
We do not maintain key man insurance for Mr. Amon. From time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team resulting
from the termination or departure of executive officers and key employees. We currently intend for our senior management and key
employees to be generally employed on an at-will basis, which means that they could terminate their employment with us at any
time. The loss of the services of Mr. Amon, or any other future key employees, for any reason could significantly delay or prevent
our development or the achievement of our strategic objectives and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our
ability to successfully pursue our growth strategy will also depend on our ability to attract, motivate and retain personnel.
We expect to face escalating compensation demands from new and prospective employees, as well as intense competition for these
employees from numerous technology, software and other companies, especially in certain geographic areas in which we intend to
operate, and we cannot ensure that we will be able to attract, motivate and/or retain additional qualified employees in the future.
If we are unable to attract new employees or retain Mr. Amon, we may not be able to adequately develop, market and maintain new
products or services at the same levels as our competitors and may, therefore, lose customers and market share. Our failure to
attract and retain personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our business objectives and, as a result,
our ability to compete could decrease, our operating results could suffer and our revenue could decrease. Even if we are able
to identify and recruit a sufficient number of new hires, these new hires will require significant training before they achieve
full productivity and they may not become productive as quickly as we would like, or at all.
If
we cannot maintain our Company’s culture as it grows, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on execution
that we believe contributes to a successful business and as a result, our business may be harmed.
We
believe that a critical component to a successful business is mission-driven company culture based on a shared commitment to make
television accessible to younger consumers, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork, passion for customers, a focus on execution,
and facilitates critical knowledge transfer, knowledge sharing and professional growth. Any failure to preserve such culture could
negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.
As we grow and develop the Company’s infrastructure, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain these important aspects.
If we fail to do so, our business may be adversely impacted.
7
If
we are unable to compete effectively with new entrants and other potential competitors, our sales and profitability could be adversely
affected.
The
sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts,
a change in our mix of products and services, anticipation of the introduction of new products or promotional programs. Competition
continues to increase in the market segments in which we may participate, and we expect competition to further increase in the
future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may
reduce the price of products that compete with theirs or may bundle them with other products and services. Additionally, currency
fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those
countries and regions. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing and introducing products with enhanced functionality
on a timely basis, or that our product offerings, if introduced, will enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels
that will allow us to maintain positive gross margins and achieve profitability.
We
may acquire or invest in other companies or technologies in the future, which could divert management’s attention, fail
to meet our expectations, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, increase expenses, disrupt our operations or otherwise
harm our operating results.
We
may in the future acquire or invest in, businesses, television broadcast assets or other assets or technologies that we believe
could complement or expand our business, enhance our capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may not be able
to fully realize the anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions or anticipated benefits may not transpire. The pursuit of
potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses related to identifying, investigating
and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.
There
are inherent risks in integrating and managing acquisitions. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to assimilate
or integrate the acquired personnel, operations, products, services and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined
business following the acquisition and our management may be distracted from operating our business. We also may not achieve the
anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including, without limitation:
●
unanticipated costs or liabilities associated
with the acquisition;
●
incurrence of acquisition-related costs, which
would be recognized as a current period expense;
●
inability to generate sufficient revenue to
offset acquisition or investment costs;
●
inability to maintain relationships with customers
and partners of the acquired business;
●
difficulty of incorporating
acquired technology and rights into our operations and of maintaining quality and security standards consistent with our intended
brands;
●
delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty
related to any acquisition;
●
the potential loss of key employees;
●
use of resources
that are needed in other parts of our business and diversion of management and employee resources;
●
inability to recognize acquired deferred revenue
in accordance with our revenue recognition policies; and
●
use of substantial portions of our available
cash and equity or the incurrence of debt to consummate the acquisition.
8
Acquisitions
also increase the risk of unforeseen legal liability, including for potential shareholder suits or potential violations of applicable
law or industry rules and regulations, arising from prior or ongoing acts or omissions by the acquired businesses that are not
discovered by due diligence during the acquisition process or new regulatory restrictions at the federal, state, or local levels.
Generally, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition may
suffer. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In
addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we may acquire may be allocated to goodwill and other intangible
assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If our acquisitions do not ultimately yield expected returns,
we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on our impairment assessment process, which could harm our results
of operations.
Because
our services may collect and store viewer and related information, domestic and international privacy and cyber security concerns,
and other laws and regulations, could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our products or services.
We
may be affected by cyber-attacks and other means of gaining unauthorized access to our products, services, systems, and data.
For instance, cyber criminals or insiders may target us or third parties with which we have business relationships to obtain data,
or in a manner that disrupts our operations or compromises our products or the systems into which our products are integrated.
The evolution of technology systems introduces ever more complex security risks that are difficult to predict and defend against.
An increasing number of companies, including those with significant online operations, have recently disclosed breaches of their
security, some of which involved sophisticated tactics and techniques allegedly attributable to criminal enterprises or nation-state
actors. While we take measures to protect the security of personal information, it is possible that our security controls over
personal information and other practices we follow may not prevent the unauthorized access to, or the unintended release of, personal
information. In addition, we do not know whether our current practices will be deemed sufficient under applicable laws or whether
new regulatory requirements might make our current practices insufficient. If there is a breach of our computer systems and we
know or suspect that certain personal information has been accessed, or used inappropriately, we may need to inform the affected
individual and may be subject to significant fines and penalties. In the event of a breach, we could face government scrutiny
or consumer class actions.
Cybersecurity
incidents directed at us or third-parties with whom we have relationships can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to
gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent
threats. Cybersecurity incidents are also constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending
against them. In the ordinary course of our business, we and such third-parties expect to collect and store personal information,
as well as our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our customers and employees. Additionally,
we expect to rely on third parties and their security procedures for the secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission
of information that is critical to our operations. Despite measures designed to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate cybersecurity
incidents, such incidents may occur to us or our third-party providers and, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially
result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information
(our own or that of third parties, including personal information of our customers and employees) and the disruption of business
operations. We expect to experience attempted routine cyber-attacks of our information technology networks, such as through phishing
scams and ransomware. Although we do not except any of these actual or attempted cyber-attacks to have a material adverse impact
on our operations or financial condition, we cannot guarantee that any such incidents will not have such an impact in the future.
For example, we may be at higher risk for interruptions, outages and breaches of: operational systems, including business, financial,
accounting, product development, data processing or production processes owned by us or such third-parties; facility security
systems, owned by us or such third-parties; in-product technology owned by us or such third-parties; any integrated software in
our solutions; or customer or other data that we process or such third-parties process on our behalf. Such cyber incidents could
materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of intellectual property, trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively
sensitive information; compromise certain information of customers, employees, suppliers, or others; jeopardize the security of
any of our facilities or equipment; or affect the performance of in-product technology and any integrated software in our solutions.
9
A
cyber incident could be caused by disasters, insiders (through inadvertence or with malicious intent) or malicious third parties
(including nation-states or nation-state supported actors) using sophisticated, targeted methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption
and other security defenses, including hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception. The techniques used by cyber attackers
change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we maintain information technology measures
designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches and other cyber incidents, such measures will require
updates and improvements, and we cannot guarantee that such measures will be adequate to detect, prevent or mitigate cyber incidents.
Any
actual or alleged security breaches or alleged violations of federal or state laws or regulations relating to privacy and data
security could result in mandated user notifications, litigation, government investigations, significant fines, and expenditures;
divert management’s attention from operations; deterring people from using our products or services; damage our brand and
reputation; and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Defending against claims
or litigation based on any security breach or incident, regardless of their merit, will be costly and may cause reputation harm.
In addition, we may incur significant costs for remediation that may include liability for stolen assets or information, repair
of system damage, and compensation to customers, employees, and business partners. The successful assertion of one or more large
claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, denial of coverage as to any specific claim, or any change or cessation
in our insurance policies and coverages, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible requirements, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We
may be subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information
security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.
We
may be subject to a number of domestic and international laws and regulations that apply to cloud services and the internet generally.
These laws, rules and regulations address a range of issues, including data privacy and cyber security, breach notification and
restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, processing, use, storage, protection, disclosure, retention
or transfer of data. The regulatory framework for online services, data privacy and cyber security issues worldwide can vary substantially
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal,
state, local and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws, rules and regulations regarding
the collection, processing, use, storage and disclosure of information, web browsing and geolocation data collection, data analytics,
facial recognition, cyber security and breach response and notification procedures. Furthermore, existing laws and regulations
are constantly evolving, and new laws and regulations that apply to our business are being introduced at every level of government
in the United States, as well as internationally. As we seek to develop our business, we are, and may increasingly become subject
to various laws, regulations, and standards, and may be subject to contractual obligations relating to data privacy and security
in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding
the use or disclosure of personal information, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of customers for
the use and disclosure of personal information is obtained, could require us to modify our products and features, possibly in
a material manner and subject to increased compliance costs, which may limit our ability to develop new products and features
that make use of the personal information that our customers may voluntarily share. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to
comply with any federal or state privacy or security laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, or codes of conduct,
regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject, or other legal obligations relating to data privacy or security could
adversely affect our reputation, brand and business, and may result in claims, liabilities, proceedings or actions against us
by governmental entities, customers or others. Any such claims, proceedings or actions could hurt our reputation, brand and business,
force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings or actions, distract our management, increase our costs
of doing business, result in a loss of customers and result in the imposition of monetary penalties.
10
In
the United States, there are numerous federal and state data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection,
use, disclosure, retention, security, transfer, storage, and other processing of personal data, including federal and state data
privacy laws, data breach notification laws, and consumer protection laws. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”)
and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online
collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. Such standards require us to publish statements that describe how we handle
personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data. If such information that we publish
is considered untrue or inaccurate, we may be subject to government claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, which could
lead to significant liabilities and consequences. Moreover, according to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or
failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal data secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or
affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. State consumer protection laws provide similar
causes of action for unfair or deceptive practices.
In
March 2021, the Governor of Virginia signed into law the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (the “VCDPA”). The
VCDPA creates consumer rights, similar to the CCPA, but also imposes security and assessment requirements for businesses. In addition,
in July 2021, Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act (“COCPA”), becoming the third comprehensive consumer privacy
law to be passed in the United States (after the CCPA and VCDPA). The COCPA closely resembles the VCDPA, and both will be enforced
by the respective states’ Attorney General and district attorneys, although the two differ in many ways. We must comply
with each if our operations fall within the scope of these newly enacted comprehensive mandates, which may increase our compliance
costs and potential liability. Similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward
more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. This legislation may add additional complexity, variation in requirements,
restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment in resources to compliance programs, could impact strategies
and availability of previously useful data, and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices
and policies.
In
addition, some laws may require us to notify governmental authorities and/or affected individuals of data breaches involving certain
personal information or other unauthorized or inadvertent access to or disclosure of such information. We may need to notify governmental
authorities and affected individuals with respect to such incidents. For example, laws in all 50 U.S. states may require businesses
to provide notice to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. These laws are not
consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach may be difficult and costly. We also may be contractually
required to notify consumers or other counterparties of a security breach. Regardless of our contractual protections, any actual
or perceived security breach or breach of our contractual obligations could harm our reputation and brand, expose us to potential
liability or require us to expend significant resources on data security and in responding to any such actual or perceived breach.
We
strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data
protection to the extent possible. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain,
it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another
or with our existing practices or the features of our products and may conflict with other rules or regulations, making enforcement,
and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Any failure or perceived failure by us to
comply with our privacy policies, privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal
obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized access to or unintended release of personally identifiable
information or other customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or public statements against us
by consumer advocacy groups or others. Any of these events could cause us to incur significant costs in investigating and defending
such claims and, if found liable, pay significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may
cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.
We
may also be subject to claims of liability or responsibility for the actions of third parties with whom we interact or upon whom
it relies in relation to various products or services, including but not limited to vendors and business partners. If so, in addition
to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and
practices or modify our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy
and/or data concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and policies,
could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business.
11
The
costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, rules, regulations and policies that are applicable to the businesses
of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our products or services. Even the perception
of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, inhibit adoption of our products or services by current and
future customers, or adversely impact our ability to attract and retain workforce talent. Our failure to comply with applicable
laws and regulations, or to protect such data, could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment of
our employees or directors and public censure, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation
and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could have a material adverse
effect on our operations, financial performance and business.
Periods
of rapid growth and expansion could place a significant strain on our resources, including our future employees, which could negatively
impact our operating results.
We
may experience periods of rapid growth and expansion, which may place a significant strain and demands on our management, our
operational and financial resources, customer operations, research and development, sales and marketing, administrative, and other
resources. To manage our possible future growth effectively, we will be required to continue to improve our management, operational
and financial systems. Future growth would also require us to successfully hire, train, motivate and manage employees. In addition,
our continued growth and the evolution of our business plan will require significant additional management, technical and administrative
resources. If we are unable to manage our growth successfully, we may not be able to effectively manage the growth and evolution
of our current business and our operating results could suffer.
Our
future performance may depend on the success of products and services we have not yet developed or acquired.
Our
success depends on the development, implementation and acceptance of our products and services. Commitments to develop new products
and services must be made well in advance of any resulting sales, and technologies and standards may change during development,
potentially rendering our products and services outdated or uncompetitive before their introduction. Our ability to develop products
and services to meet evolving industry requirements and at prices acceptable to our customers will be significant factors in determining
our competitiveness. We may expend considerable funds and other resources on the development of our products and services without
any guarantee that these products will be successful. If we are not successful in bringing one or more products or types of services
to market, whether because we fail to address marketplace demand, fail to develop viable technologies or otherwise, our revenues
may decline and our results of operations could be seriously harmed.
Our
operating results may be harmed if we are required to collect taxes on our billings in jurisdictions where it has not historically
done so.
Taxing
jurisdictions, including state, local and federal taxing authorities, have differing rules and regulations governing taxes, and
these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, significant judgment
is required in evaluating our tax positions and our provision for taxes. While we believe that we are in material compliance with
our obligations under applicable taxing regimes, one or more states, localities or the federal government may seek to impose tax
collection obligations on us. It is possible that we could face tax audits and that such audits could result in tax-related liabilities
for which we have not accrued. A successful assertion that we should be collecting taxes in jurisdictions where it has not historically
done so and do not accrue for taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing
from us or otherwise harm our business and operating results.
In
addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and
other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, jurisdictional mix of profits
at varying statutory tax rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred
tax assets and liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or
litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse
effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which a determination is made.
We
expect to require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable
terms, if at all.
We
intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and expect to require additional funds to respond to business
challenges, including the potential need to develop new business segments, services, features or enhance our products, improve
our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we expect to need to engage in
equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible
debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities that we issue could
have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Common Stock. Any debt financing that we may secure
in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational
matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including
potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. If we are unable
to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to it when we require it, our ability to continue to support our
business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be adversely affected.
12
Without
obtaining adequate capital funding or improving our financial performance, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.
Our
recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
without additional capital-raising activities. As a result, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. Failure to secure additional funding may require us to modify, delay, or abandon some of our planned
future expansion or development, or to otherwise enact operating cost reductions available to management, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and ability to achieve our intended business objectives.
The
requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management’s attention.
As
a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley
Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations.
The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual and current reports with the SEC with respect to our business
and operating results. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, makes some
activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increases demand on our systems and resources.
As
a result of disclosure of information in this Annual Report and in filings required of a public company, our business and financial
condition is more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other
third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do not
result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert
resources of our management and harm our business and operating results.
As
a smaller reporting company, we are subject to scaled disclosure requirements that may make it more challenging for investors
to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.
As
a “smaller reporting company,” we (i) are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings,
(ii) are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting
firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and (iii) have certain other
decreased disclosure obligations in our filings with the SEC, including being required to provide only two years of audited financial
statements in annual reports. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and
financial prospects.
We
will remain a smaller reporting company until the beginning of a fiscal year in which we had a public float of $250 million held
by non-affiliates as of the last business day of the second quarter of the prior fiscal year, assuming our Common Stock is registered
under Section 12 of the Exchange Act on the applicable evaluation date. Even if we remain a smaller reporting company, if our
public float exceeds $250 million and our annual revenues are greater than $100 million, we will become subject to the provisions
of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
As
a result of being a public company, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable to remediate
the material weaknesses, or if we fail to develop and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements or comply with applicable
laws and regulations could be impaired, which may adversely affect our business and the price of our Common Stock.
As
a public company, we are required to furnish a report by our management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting for each Annual Report on Form 10-K that we file with the SEC. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any
material weaknesses identified by our management in internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal control over
financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls
and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered
in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal control over financial
reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect
on the trading price of our Common Stock.
13
We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
We
did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. Specifically,
we lacked a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of internal controls and accounting knowledge, training
and experience commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. Additionally, the limited personnel resulted in our inability
to consistently establish appropriate authorities and responsibilities in pursuit of our financial reporting objectives, as demonstrated
by, among other things, insufficient segregation of duties in our finance and accounting functions. This material weakness contributed
to the following additional material weaknesses:
(1)
lack of a functioning audit committee and no outside directors on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in
the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
(2)
inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives;
(3)
insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application
of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and SEC disclosure requirements; and
(4)
ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were
identified and communicated to management in connection with the preparation and audit of our financial statements as of December
31, 2022, and the preparation of our 2023 quarterly financial statements.
While
we are undertaking efforts to remediate these material weaknesses, the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until
our remediation plan has been fully implemented, the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we have
concluded, through testing, that the newly implemented and enhanced controls are operating effectively. At this time, we cannot
predict the success of such efforts or the outcome of our assessment of the remediation efforts. We can give no assurance that
our efforts will remediate these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or that additional material
weaknesses will not be identified in the future.
The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations,
judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the possibility of human error and the risk
of fraud. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses, our ability to record, process and report financial information
accurately, and to prepare the consolidated financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and regulations
of the SEC, could be adversely affected which, in turn, may adversely affect our reputation and business and the trading price
of our Common Stock. Our failure to design and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also result
in errors in our consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of such financial statements and could
cause us to fail to meet such time periods, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and cause a decline in the price
of our Common Stock. In addition, any such failures could result in litigation or regulatory actions by the SEC or other regulatory
authorities, loss of investor confidence, our Common Stock no longer being quoted on the over-the-counter market, harm to our
reputation and financial condition, or diversion of financial and management resources from the operation of our business.
14
Our
reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
GAAP
is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC, and various bodies formed
to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant
effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions already completed before the announcement
of such change.
We
may be vulnerable to continued global economic uncertainty causing volatility in financial markets.
Our
business may be sensitive to changes in general economic conditions and the financial markets inside the United States and internationally,
which have experienced extreme disruption in recent times, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices,
severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, and declining valuations of investments. We believe these disruptions are
likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy. A continued economic downturn and financial market disruptions
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any uncertainties relating
to COVID-19 or other adverse public health developments, inflation, the foreign and domestic government sanctions imposed on Russia
as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, or global supply chain disruptions may cause consumers, businesses, and governments to
defer purchases in response to tighter credit, decreased cash availability and declining consumer confidence. Accordingly, demand
for our products or services could decrease and differ materially from current expectations. Further, some of our customers may
require substantial financing in order to fund their operations and subscribe or purchase products or services from us. The inability
of these customers to obtain sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products or services and meet their payment obligations
to us or possible insolvencies of our customers could result in decreased customer demand and could adversely impact our financial
results.
Risks
Related to Our Common Stock
The
market price of our Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company with a small
and thinly traded public float, and lack of profits, and you may lose some or all of your investment.
The
market for our Common Stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to the securities of larger, more established
companies that have large public floats, and we expect that the price of our Common Stock will continue to be more volatile than
the securities of such larger, more established companies for the indefinite future. The volatility in the price of our Common
Stock is attributable to a number of factors. First, as noted above, our Common Stock is, compared to the securities of such larger,
more established companies, sporadically and thinly traded. The price of our Common Stock could, for example, decline precipitously
in the event that a large number of shares of our Common Stock is sold on the market without commensurate demand. Secondly, we
are a speculative or “risky” investment due to our lack of profits to date. As a consequence of this enhanced risk,
more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack
of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares of Common Stock on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would
be the case with the securities of a larger, more established company that has a large public float. Such volatility can also
occur due to a variety of other factors, including the following:
●
the inability to maintain the quotation of the
Common Stock on the over-the-counter market;
●
changes in applicable laws or regulations;
●
risks relating to the uncertainty of our projected
financial information; and
●
risks related to the organic and inorganic growth
of our business and the timing of expected business milestones.
In
addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the
market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the
operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors, as well as general economic, political, regulatory
and market conditions, may negatively affect the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our Common Stock regardless of our operating
performance.
Volatility
in the prices of our Common Stock could subject us to securities class action litigation.
In
the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price
of its securities or the completion of a merger. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion
of management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business.
15
Our
Common Stock is quoted on the Experts Market tier of the OTC Markets Group Inc., which may have an unfavorable impact on the price
of our Common Stock and liquidity. Our Common Stock may not be eligible for listing on a national securities exchange.
Our
Common Stock is quoted on the Experts Market tier of OTC Markets Group, Inc. This tier is a significantly more limited market
than other national securities exchanges, such as those operated by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. The quotation of our Common Stock
on the over-the-counter market may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares
of our Common Stock, could depress the trading price of our Common Stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability
to raise capital in the future. There is no guarantee that any such national securities exchange or other quotation system will
permit our Common Stock to be listed and traded. As a result, investors may find it difficult to buy or sell or obtain accurate
quotations for our Common Stock, and the liquidity of our Common Stock remain limited. These factors may have an adverse impact
on the trading and price of our Common Stock.
We
cannot predict the extent to which an active public trading market for our Common Stock will develop or be sustained. If an active
public trading market for our Common Stock does not develop or cannot be sustained, you may be unable to liquidate your investment
in our securities.
At
present, there is minimal public trading in our Common Stock. We cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for
our Common Stock will develop or be sustained due to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company that
is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors, and others in the investment community that generate
or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be
reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our securities until such time as
we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our
Common Stock is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity
that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on market price. We cannot give you any assurance that
an active public trading market for our securities will develop or be sustained. If such a market cannot be sustained, you may
be unable to liquidate your investment in our securities.
U.S.
broker-dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in shares of our Common Stock because they may be considered penny
stocks and thus be subject to the penny stock rules.
The
SEC has adopted a number of rules to regulate “penny stock” that restricts transactions involving stock which is deemed
to be penny stock. Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Exchange
Act. These rules may have the effect of reducing the liquidity of penny stocks. “Penny stocks” generally are equity
securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges
if current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system).
Our shares of Common Stock have in the past constituted, and may again in the future constitute, “penny stock” within
the meaning of the rules. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon U.S. broker-dealers may discourage
such broker-dealers from effecting transactions in shares of our Common Stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity
of such shares of Common Stock and impede their sale in the secondary market.
A
U.S. broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or “accredited investor” (generally,
an individual with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or
her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser’s written consent
to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the “penny
stock” regulations require the U.S. broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a “penny stock”,
a disclosure schedule prepared in accordance with SEC standards relating to the “penny stock” market, unless the broker-dealer
or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A U.S. broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the U.S. broker-dealer
and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a U.S. broker-dealer is required to submit
monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the “penny stock” held in a customer’s
account and information with respect to the limited market in “penny stocks”.
16
Stockholders
should be aware that, according to the SEC, the market for “penny stocks” has suffered in recent years from patterns
of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include: (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are
often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false
and misleading press releases; (iii) “boiler room” practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic
price projections by inexperienced salespersons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers;
and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired
level, resulting in investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock
market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate
in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being
established with respect to our securities.
Because
certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our Common Stock, they may have effective control over actions
requiring stockholder approval.
As
of the date of the filing of this Annual Report and in part due to the Change of Control, Arena, together with its affiliates,
beneficially owns an aggregate of 2,347,661,906 shares of Common Stock as well as all shares of outstanding Series B Preferred
Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), providing such holder the ability to vote approximately
90.2% of the total voting power of our capital stock. One of the entities affiliated with Arena, Portents Holdings LLC, beneficially
owns all of our outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, which shares alone entitles it to voting power equivalent to the number
of votes equal to 51% of the total voting power of each class of stock outstanding. Due to such disproportionate voting power,
new investors will not be able to effect a change in our business or management, and therefore, stockholders would have limited
recourse as a result of decisions made by management. As a result, Arena has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted
to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially
all of our assets. In addition, Arena has the ability to control the management and affairs of our Company. Accordingly, this
concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our Common Stock by:
●
delaying,
deferring or preventing a change in corporate control;
●
impeding
a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or
●
discouraging
a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, or publish negative reports, the price of our Common
Stock and trading volume could decline.
The
trading market for our Common Stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish
about us. We do not have any control over these analysts. If our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates or one
or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Common Stock, change their opinion, or reduce the target stock price for our
Common Stock, our Common Stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts do not publish reports on us regularly
or at all, we will not likely have visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our Common Stock price or trading volume
to decline.
Because
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our shares of Common Stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation,
if any, would be your sole source of gain if you hold such shares.
We
currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and we do
not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation,
if any, of our Common Stock would be your sole source of gain on an investment in such shares for the foreseeable future.
17
A
large number of outstanding shares of our Common Stock is currently restricted from resale. The number of shares eligible for
public sale upon the lapse of such restrictions and conversions of outstanding convertible notes and preferred stock could depress
the market price of our Common Stock dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders.
The
following summarizes certain transactions in which a large number of shares of Common Stock were issued, which shares are currently
restricted from resale but may in the future be sold upon the lapse of such restrictions:
●
In connection with
the issuance of convertible notes to the Investors, we issued to them shares of our Series F convertible preferred stock,
par value $0.001 per share (“Series F Preferred Stock”), which was subsequently converted into 192,073,017 shares
of Common Stock.
●
In connection with
the issuance of a promissory note to Z4 in December 2021, we issued it warrants to purchase up to 500,000 shares of our Common
Stock.
●
155,000 issued and
outstanding shares of our Series D convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series D Preferred
Stock”), may be converted into 155,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
●
We have issued 1,152,500
shares of the Series E-1 convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series E-1 Preferred Stock”),
which were issued in September 2021 and automatically convert into 1,152,500,000 shares of Common Stock two years from the
date of issuance. The Company has not processed such conversions as of the date of this Annual Report.
●
We have issued 39,895
shares of Series H convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series H Preferred Stock”), which
may be converted into 39,895,000 shares of Common Stock.
●
As of the date of
this Annual Report, the outstanding aggregate principal balance, including accrued interest, of outstanding convertible notes,
excluding the Investors’ Notes all of which are currently in default is convertible into approximately 163,000,000 shares
of Common Stock.
Sales
of our Common Stock as such restrictions are lifted and such conversions occur (or in connection with any anticipated conversions)
may make it more difficult for us to sell our Common Stock and other equity securities in the future at a time and at a price
that we deem appropriate. Such conversions and sales could also cause the trading price of our Common Stock to fall and dilute
the ownership of our existing stockholders.
We
could issue “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting then current stockholder
interests and impairing their voting rights; and provisions in our organizational documents could discourage a takeover that stockholders
may consider favorable.
Our
articles of incorporation, as amended (“Articles of Incorporation”), authorizes the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares
of “blank check” preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time
by our Board. Our Board is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue a series of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation,
conversion, voting or other rights which could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, our common stockholders.
The issuance of a series of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change in control
of the Company. For example, it would be possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights
or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of the Company. Currently, shares of our Series
B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E-1 Preferred Stock and Series H Preferred Stock are currently outstanding,
each with preferential rights over the Common Stock.
Our
Articles of Incorporation, amended and restated bylaws (“Bylaws”) and Nevada law have anti-takeover provisions that
could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, which may cause the prices of our securities to decline.
Our
Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Nevada law contain provisions which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire
us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue up to 50,000,000
shares of “blank check” preferred stock. This preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which
may be determined at the time of issuance by our board of directors without further action by stockholders. Currently, shares
of our Series B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E-1 Preferred Stock and Series H Preferred Stock are currently
outstanding, each with preferential rights over the Common Stock. The terms of such series of preferred stock any other series
of preferred stock may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to
dividend, liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. Such classes of preferred stock now and hereinafter
issued could materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of our securities, and therefore, reduce the value of our securities.
In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with,
or sell our assets to, a third party and thereby preserve control by current management.
18
Our
Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or Nevada law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and
inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers
to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:
●
the inability of
our stockholders to call a special meeting;
●
the right of our
Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; and
●
the ability of our
directors to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors.
●
Provisions of our
Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or Nevada law also could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals
or making a tender offer or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes a stockholder might consider favorable.
Such provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. In particular,
our Articles of Incorporation, our Bylaws or Nevada law, as applicable, among other things, may provide our Board of Directors
with the ability to alter our Bylaws without stockholder approval, and provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may
be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum.
In
addition, we are subject to Nevada’s Combination with Interested Stockholders Statute (Nevada Revised Statutes 78.411 –
78.444), which prohibits an interested stockholder from entering into a “combination” with the corporation, unless
certain conditions are met. These provisions are expected to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate
takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of our company to first negotiate with our Board of Directors.
These provisions may delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, which may cause the market price of our Common
Stock to decline.
We
are also subject to Nevada’s Acquisition of Controlling Interest Statute (Nevada Revised Statutes 78.378 – 78.3793),
which prohibits an acquirer, under certain circumstances, from voting shares of a corporation’s stock after crossing specific
threshold ownership percentages. These provisions have the effect of discouraging or delaying from acquiring or merging with us.

Market Information
Our Common Stock was quoted on the Pink
Open Market maintained by the OTC Markets Group Inc. (the “OTC”) under the symbol “MDEX” from April 26,
2006 to July 14, 2023 and is now quoted on the Expert Market operated by the OTC since July 17, 2023. Quotations of Expert Market
securities are restricted from public viewing. It is our objective that the Common Stock once again be quoted on the Pink Open
Market, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in such regard. The following table lists the high and low prices
of our Common Stock for each of our fiscal quarters for the last two fiscal years and for the interim periods ended June 30, 2025.

(f)
Penny Stock Rules
Trading
in our Common Stock is subject to the “penny stock” rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that generally define a
penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These
rules require that any broker-dealer who recommends our Common Stock to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors,
must, prior to the sale, make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s
written agreement to execute the transaction. Unless an exception is available, the regulations require the delivery, prior to
any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with
trading in the penny stock market. In addition, broker-dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and
the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers
by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit their
market price and liquidity of our securities. The application of the “penny stock” rules may affect your ability to
resell our securities.

7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
THE
FOLLOWING PRESENTATION OF OUR PLAN OF OPERATION OF SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED HEREIN.
RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS
On
November 6, 2023, the shareholders of the Company removed Philip Falcone and Warren Zenna as our directors and appointed Thomas
Amon as the sole member of our board of directors. Mr. Amon removed all our officers and was appointed as the Company’s
President, Secretary, Treasurer, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer.
RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
Our
consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly,
do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term
operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.
Years
Ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022
General
and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased
to $426,757 for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $719,618 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily
because of winding down operating activities due to a lack of funds.
23
Professional
Fees
Professional fees decreased to $140,434
for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $1,919,179 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily as a result
of winding down operating activities due to a lack of funds.
Bad Debt Expense
Bad debt expense decreased to $Nil for the
year ended December 31, 2023 from $818,279 for the year ended December 31, 2022. We transferred all accounts receivable to the
Investors on February 1, 2023 and did not incur any bad debt expense in January 2023. In 2022, we wrote off $818,279 notes receivable
primarily from Top Dog Productions Inc. and ZA Group Inc. as uncollectible and incurred bad debt expense.
Loss from Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Our loss from impairment of long-lived assets was $Nil and $197,427 for the years ended December 31,
2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2022, our intangible assets primarily consisted of our domain names and access to a third-party
streaming platform for our BCTV business, which are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets that are not amortized but instead
are tested at least annually for impairment. Based on management’s assessment of the lack of revenue to date and the prospects
for future revenues using the intangible assets, we fully impaired the assets and recognized an impairment charge of $197,427
in the year ended December 31, 2022.
Amortization expense and interest expense
Amortization expense and interest expense
decreased to $4,724,398 for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $5,612,597 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease
resulted primarily from the $9,159,907 reduction in principal on the senior secured notes on February 1, 2023 pursuant to an agreement
with the lender to transfer ownership of Sovryn’s net assets to the lender.
Discontinued Operations
Our loss from discontinued operations was
$9,709 for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to a loss of $3,681,408 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Effective
February 1, 2023, we entered into an agreement with a lender in which we exchanged our ownership of the assets associated with
Sovryn’s broadcast television business in exchange for a $9,159,907 reduction in our obligation for the senior secured notes.
As a result, the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of Sovryn are included as discontinued operations for the year ended
December 31, 2023 and 2022. The 2023 loss resulted from Sovryn’s operations for the month of January 2023.
24
Net
Loss
Net loss decreased to $5,301,298 for the
year ended December 31, 2023, from $12,909,394 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily the result of decreases
in professional fees, general and administrative expenses, bad debt expense and the loss from discontinued operations and interest
expense. The net loss from continuing operations per basic diluted share was $0.0033 and $0.0058, respectively, with basic and
diluted weighted averages shares outstanding of 1,603,095,243 and 1,599,829,313 for the respective periods. The net loss from discontinued
operations per basic and diluted share was $0.0000 and $0.0023, respectively, with basic and diluted weighted averages shares outstanding
of 1,603,095,243 and 1,599,829,313 for the respective periods.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Cash
and Working Capital
As at December 31, 2023, we had $Nil in
cash and a $17,585,746 working capital deficit, compared to cash of $Nil and working capital deficit of $12,372,123 as at December
31, 2022. The increase in the working capital deficit primarily resulted from the transfer of all Sovryn assets on February 1,
2023 according to the Partial Foreclosure Agreement with the lenders (Investors).
We
will require additional capital to meet our long- and short-term operating requirements. For the year ended December 31, 2023,
our principal source of liquidity was our cash that we obtained from borrowings. Our principal use of cash was to fund operations.
We expect that the principal uses of cash in the future will be for continuing operations associated with rolling out our business
plan and repayment of notes payable that are not converted into our Common Stock or renegotiated.
Net Cash Used in Continuing Operating
Activities
We used $323,288 in cash from continuing
operating activities for the year ended December 31 2023, compared to cash used of $2,823,783 from continuing operating activities
during the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in cash used in continuing operations resulted primarily from increases in
our accounts payable and accrued liabilities because we me minimal payments in 2023 due to a lack of cash.
Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities
We
used cash of $Nil and $Nil in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities
of $363,710 came primarily from proceeds from subordinated loans and borrowings from finance companies that we entered into during
the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $1,762,500 of cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December
31, 2022 that we generated from proceeds of subordinated notes payable and warrants that we sold to investors.
Net
Cash from Discontinued Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2023, we
used $40,422 of cash in discontinued operating activities which ceased on February 1, 2023, as compared to generating $1,075,067
of cash from discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease primarily resulted from the transfer of
our ownership of Sovryn on February 1, 2023 according to the Partial Foreclosure Agreement with the Investors. We used cash of
$Nil and $14,513 in discontinued investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. We used cash of $Nil and
$Nil in discontinued financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
25
Discontinued
Operations
In
the fourth quarter of 2022, management at that time determined that Sovryn’s television broadcast business was not an efficient
use of our resources to develop and launch BCTV, our core business, and sought to exit Sovryn’s business and reduce Madison’s
senior debt it incurred in connection with acquiring Sovryn’s assets and creating its business. As a result, Sovryn is recognized
as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The previous year’s assets, liabilities
and expenses have been similarly classified for comparative purposes. The following is a summary of Sovryn for the years ended
December 31, 2023 and 2022:

Going
Concern
The
independent auditors’ reports accompanying our December 31, 2023 and 2022 consolidated financial statements in this Annual
Report contain an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Such consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize
our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.
26
Transactions
with Related Parties
Mr.
Warren Zenna was a member of our Board of Directors until November 6, 2023. On March 1, 2022, we granted a warrant to Mr. Zenna
to purchase up to 500,000 shares of our Common Stock at $0.025 per share at any time beginning September 1, 2022 and ending September
1, 2026. We estimate the value such warrant to be approximately $7,641, based on the $0.015282 market price per share of our Common
Stock on March 1, 2022.
On
April 7, 2021, we issued 1,500,000 shares of our Common Stock valued at $1,500 to Mr. Canouse in exchange for transferring his
100 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock to FFO1, an entity controlled by Mr. Falcone, then our Chief Executive Officer and
Chairman of our Board of Directors. The 100 shares of Series B Preferred Stock provide the holder thereof the right to vote 51%
of the voting power of each class of outstanding voting shares of capital stock. FFO1 also held 461,000 shares of Series E-1 Preferred
Stock and FFO2 held 461,000 shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock. Lisa Falcone, wife of Mr. Falcone, is the trustee of FFO2 and
Ms. Falcone has shared voting and dispositive power. Such shares of preferred stock held by FFO1 and FFO2 are included in the
Pledged Assets.
Effective
January 1, 2022, we entered into a management consulting agreement with GreenRock LLC, a company controlled by Mr. Falcone, for
a period of one year ending December 31, 2022, pursuant to which we provided monthly remuneration of $35,000, plus expenses in
connection with his duties, responsibilities and performance as our chief executive officer. In February 2021, Sovryn entered
into a consulting agreement with GreenRock LLC to provide us with chief executive officer services. The agreements expired on
December 31, 2022 and were not renewed. In the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we paid GreenRock LLC $35,000 and $420,000
in fees, respectively. We paid GreenRock LLC bonuses of $Nil and $505,972 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
On
February 1, 2023, we entered into the Partial Foreclosure Agreement with the Investors pursuant to which we transferred ownership
of our Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) licenses and other broadcast television assets to a third-party entity
controlled by the Investors. In consideration therefor, the Investors agreed to reduce the indebtedness under the Notes by $11,600,000.
On September 21, 2023, the Agent for the Investors delivered to us a notice that the Agent has exercised the Investors’
rights to vote the Pledged Interests, including the 100 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, and to exercise the Investors’
rights, powers and privileges to pass certain resolutions and to amend our bylaws then in effect to, among other things, (i) remove
the Board of Directors and all Company officers, and (ii) reduce the number of the Board of Directors from three directors to
one director. As a result of the Agent sending such notice and exercising its rights to vote the Pledged Interests, the Change
of Control occurred.
On
November 6, 2023, the shareholders of the Company removed Philip Falcone and Warren Zenna as our directors and appointed Thomas
Amon as the sole member of our board of directors. Mr. Amon removed all our officers and appointed himself as the Company’s
President, Secretary, Treasurer, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
New
pronouncements issued for future implementation are discussed in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements, in our Notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Critical
Accounting Policies
We
follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements. A complete summary of these
policies is included in Note 1 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Certain of
the policies require management to make significant and subjective estimates or assumptions that may deviate from actual results.
In particular, management makes estimates regarding the useful life of long-lived assets related to depreciation and amortization
expense, estimates regarding fair value of our reporting units and future cash flows with respect to assessing potential impairment
of both long-lived assets and goodwill and estimates of expense related to our debt and equity instruments. Each of these estimates
is discussed in greater detail in the following discussion.
27
Derivative
Liabilities
In connection with the issuance of promissory
and convertible notes, in certain instances we issued common share purchase warrants (the "Warrants") that entitle the
holder to purchase shares of our Common Stock at a specified fixed exercise price at any time within a time period specified within
each Warrant. We evaluated the embedded conversion feature, if any, and the warrants and concluded that they qualified as equity
instruments under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity’s
Own Equity. The fair value of the Warrants were separated from the promissory and convertible notes and accounted for as a reduction
of the carrying amount of the note with an increase to additional paid-in capital.
The fair value of the Warrants that represented
a discount was amortized and included in the consolidated statements of operation over the term of each note using the effective
interest method.
The Series A and C convertible preferred stock (“Series A Preferred Stock” and “Series
C Preferred Stock”) we issued were accounted for as mezzanine equity and the embedded conversion feature was accounted for
as derivative liabilities with change in fair value at each reporting period end charged to the consolidated statements of operations
in accordance with ASC 480 and ASC 815.
We evaluated the embedded conversion features
concluded that the conversion feature qualified as equity instruments under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives
and Hedging, and ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity. The fair values of the embedded conversion features of were
separated from those convertible notes and accounted for as a reduction of the total carrying amounts of those convertible notes
and an increase to additional paid-in capital.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Madison Technologies Inc.
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial
Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Madison Technologies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, mezzanine equity and stockholders’ deficiency,
and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Restatement of 2022 Consolidated Financial
Statements
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the 2022 consolidated financial statements have been restated to correct misstatements.
Material Uncertainty Related to Going
Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations, has negative cash flows from operating activities,
working capital deficiency and has an accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is
not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our
audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The following are descriptions of the
restatement adjustments to the consolidated balance sheet.
1.
The Company identified a presentation error in the prior year consolidated financial statements, in which intercompany balance was incorrectly classified as an investment rather than being eliminated in consolidation. As a result, the prior period financial statements have been restated to correct this error. .
2.
The adjustment reflects additional
interest accrual related to certain issued debt instruments, resulting from corrections to prior period calculations. The Company
determined that the original accruals did not fully comply with the terms of the respective debt agreements. Accordingly, the
restatement increases both accrued liabilities and interest expense.
Additionally, it reflects accruals
of a previously unrecorded professional fee.
3.
The adjustment reflects a decrease in derivative liabilities and a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital and convertible notes, due to a 2021 amendment to the warrant agreement that met the fixed-for-fixed criteria and required equity classification. The restatement reflects the impact of this amendment which was inadvertently omitted from the prior year’s consolidated financial statements.
4.
The adjustment reflects a reallocation of discounts on promissory and convertible notes payable to equity, following a reassessment of warrants that meet the criteria for separate equity classification under U.S. GAAP. This resulted in a reduced initial carrying amount of the related debt, which is amortized over the term of the notes.
5.
The adjustment represents an increase of interest payable due to an inadvertent under-accrual on debts. .
6.
The adjustment reflects a correction in
the accounting for debt discounts on senior secured notes, primarily due to a reassessment of embedded feature classification and
the application of the effective interest method. The restatement revises the amortization profile of the unamortized discount
to align with the effective interest rate methodology.
The restatement corrects the application
of the amortization method used in prior periods. using the effective interest rate method, resulting in a revised amortization
profile of the unamortized discount.
7.
The adjustment represents the reclassification of preferred stock based on an evaluation of the relevant rights and terms under U.S. GAAP. The Series A and C Preferred Stock have been reclassified to mezzanine equity. The Series D, E, E-1, F, G, and H Preferred Stock have been reclassified to permanent equity. This restatement corrects the prior period classification to reflect the appropriate presentation.
8.
The adjustment primarily reflects (i) the recognition of equity-classified warrants issued in connection with various debt instruments, resulting in an increase to additional paid-in capital (APIC), and (ii) the correction of the Series E Preferred Stock fair value issued as consideration in a business combination during 2021 with a corresponding impact on goodwill; subsequently the inflated goodwill was fully impaired. The correction reduces both APIC and accumulated deficit.

The following descriptions of the restatement adjustments to
the consolidated statements of operations   excludes a description of errors previously identified and concluded as immaterial
that were also corrected as part of the restatement.
1.
The adjustment reflects a reclassification from amortization expenses as the amount should have been included in general and administrative expenses.
2.
The adjustment represents a net increase in professional fees that resulted from the correction to accounting for issuances of notes payable. See note 2 to the restatement of the consolidated balance sheet.
3.
The adjustment reflects
a)
A reclassification from amortization expenses as the amount should have been included in general and administrative expenses
b)
The correction of previously overstated amortization expense on debt instruments, resulting from the application
of the effective interest method. The restatement aligns expense recognition with U.S. GAAP and recalculates amortized interest
based on contractual loan terms.  See notes 4, 5 and 6 to the restatement of the balance sheet.
4.
In addition, interest expense increased as a result of recalculating periodic interest based on the contractual
loan terms. See notes 2 to the restatement of the balance
sheet

The following descriptions of the restatement adjustments to the consolidated statements of mezzanine
equity and stockholders’ deficiency excludes a description of errors previously identified and concluded as immaterial that
were also corrected as part of the restatement.
1.
The adjustment represents the reclassification of Series D, E-1 and H Preferred Stock as permanent equity rather than as originally reported mezzanine equity.
2.
The adjustment corrects prior-period
errors in the accounting for equity-classified warrants issued with promissory and senior secured notes. The warrants have now
been properly recognized under U.S. GAAP, resulting in an increase to additional paid-in capital. See note 3 to the restatement
of the consolidated balance sheet.
3.
The adjustment   is primarily
composed of the following:
(1)   During
year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued Series A and B preferred stock to acquire a license agreement. Previously
the
fair value assigned to those preferred stock was approximately $343,000 and the license agreement acquired was
recognized at the same amount.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the license agreement asset was disposed.
After reassessment of the
fair
value of Series A and B preferred stock, the Company determined the fair value was approximately $70,000. The
effect of this reassessment resulted
in an adjustment to reduce fair value of Series A and B preferred stock of
$270,000 and a decrease of accumulated deficit of the
same amount. See note 8 to the restatement of the consolidated
balance sheet.
(2)   During
the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued Series E Preferred Stock as consideration in a business combination.
Previously
the fair value assigned to Series E preferred stock was approximately $4.2M and a goodwill in the same
amount was recognized upon the business combination.
During year ended December 31, 2021, the goodwill was fully
impaired.
After reassessment of the
fair
value of Series E preferred stock, the Company determined the fair value was approximately $380,000. The effect
of this reassessment resulted
in an adjustment to reduce fair value of Series E preferred stock of approximately
$3.8M and a
decrease in the accumulated deficit by the same
amount. See note 8 to the restatement of the
consolidated balance
sheet.
(3)   During
the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued Series F Preferred Stock pursuant to acquisition of the senior secured
notes
financing. Previously the fair value assigned to Series F preferred stock was approximately $864,000 and the
Company wrongly charged $864,000
as expenses in 2021.
After reassessment of the
fair value of Series F preferred stock, the Company determined the fair value was approximately $32,000. The effect of this
reassessment resulted in an adjustment to separate $32,000 from additional paid-in capital to treat as a discount of senior
secured notes face value, reduce fair value of Series F preferred stock of approximately $832,000, decrease of accumulated
deficit of
approximately $864,000. See note 8 to the restatement of the consolidated balance sheet.

Note 3 Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and
the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated no revenues
from continuing operations, incurred a net loss of $5,291,589 [2022 - $9,227,986] and had a working capital deficit and an accumulated
deficit of $17,585,746 and $28,857,578, respectively [2022 - $12,372,123 and $23,556,280 respectively]. It is management’s
opinion that these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months
from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
management’s ability to raise additional capital as needed from the sales of stock or debt and further implement our business
plan. However, the Company may not be able to secure such financing in a timely manner or on favourable terms, if at all. Furthermore,
if the Company issues equity securities to raise additional funds, its existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the
new equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the Company’s existing stockholders.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be required should we be unable to
continue as a going concern.
Note 4 Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US
GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.
Significant accounting estimates and
assumptions
The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions to be made in applying the accounting policies that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and
related assumptions are based on previous experiences and other factors considered reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making the assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources.
The estimates and underlying assumptions
are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised
if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current
and future periods.
Significant accounts that require estimates
as the basis for determining the stated amounts include impairment analysis and fair value of warrants, promissory notes, convertible
notes, senior secured notes and derivative liabilities.
●Fair value of equity classified conversion feature and warrants
In determining the fair value of the equity
classified conversion feature and warrant pursuant to debt financing transactions, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following assumptions: volatility rate, risk-free rate, and the remaining expected life of the warrants that are
classified under equity.
●Fair value of derivative liabilities
In determining the fair values of the derivative
liabilities from the conversion features and warrants issued pursuant to debt financing and equity financing transactions, the
Company used Monte-Carlo model with the following assumptions: dividend yields, volatility, risk-free rate and the remaining expected
life. Changes in those assumptions and inputs could in turn impact the fair value of the derivative liabilities and can have a
material impact on the reported loss and comprehensive loss for the applicable reporting period.
●Impairment of Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The Company evaluates the recoverability
of its intangible assets and goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
The assessment of impairment involves significant management judgment and estimates, particularly in determining whether impairment
indicators exist and in estimating future undiscounted cash flows and recoverable amounts of the assets.
Key assumptions used in this analysis include
expected future cash flows, projected operating performance, time horizons, growth rates, and discount rates, all of which require
a high degree of judgment and are subject to uncertainty. Changes in these assumptions or a deterioration in the economic environment
may result in the recognition of impairment losses.
As of the reporting date, management reviewed
the carrying amounts of assets including accounts receivable, equipment, intangible assets, and goodwill, and determined that no
impairment was required. However, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods.
●Impairment of Property and Equipment
The Company reviews the carrying value
of property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not
be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment exists involves significant management judgment, including identifying triggering
events, estimating future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset, and assessing recoverability
based on those projections.
Key assumptions include anticipated future
operating results, usage patterns, asset-specific performance, and potential for alternative use or disposition. These assumptions
are subject to change based on future market conditions or operational changes.
As of the reporting date, management evaluated
its property and equipment for indicators of impairment and determined that no impairment charges were required. However, the estimates
and assumptions used in this analysis are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods.
●Impairment of Right-of-Use Assets
The Company evaluates right-of-use (ROU)
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an ROU asset may not be
recoverable. Determining whether an impairment exists involves significant judgment, including the identification of impairment
indicators and the estimation of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the
underlying leased asset.
Key assumptions in the evaluation include
lease term assumptions, sublease income (if applicable), asset utilization strategies, and market conditions affecting the economic
benefit of the leased asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and require management to make judgments about future conditions.
As of the reporting date, the Company assessed
its ROU assets for impairment and concluded that no impairment charges were required. However, future changes in expected use or
economic conditions could result in impairment in subsequent periods.
●Useful life of property and equipment
The Company employs significant estimates
to determine the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, considering industry trends such as technological advancements,
past experience, expected use and review of asset useful lives. The Company makes estimates when determining depreciation methods,
depreciation rates and asset useful lives, which requires considering industry trends and company-specific factors. The Company
reviews depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values annually or when circumstances change and adjusts its depreciation
methods and assumptions prospectively.
●Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Company
has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a previous event, if it is probable that the Company will be required
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation. The amount recognized is the best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties
surrounding the obligations. Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best
estimate of the expected future cash flows.
●Contingencies
Contingencies can be either possible assets
or possible liabilities arising from past events, which, by their nature, will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future
events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence and potential impact of contingencies inherently involves the exercise
of significant judgment and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events.
●Income and other taxes
The calculation of current and deferred
income taxes requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions and to exercise judgment regarding the carrying values of assets
and liabilities which are subject to accounting estimates inherent in those balances, the interpretation of income tax legislation
across various jurisdictions, expectations about future operating results, the timing of reversal of temporary differences and
possible audits of income tax filings by the tax authorities. In addition, when the Company incurs losses for income tax purposes,
it assesses the probability of taxable income being available in the future based on its budgeted forecasts. These forecasts are
adjusted to take into account certain non-taxable income and expenses and specific rules on the use of unused credits and tax losses.
When the forecasts indicate that sufficient
future taxable income will be available to deduct the temporary differences, a deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible
temporary differences. Changes or differences in underlying estimates or assumptions may result in changes to the current or deferred
income tax balances on the consolidated balance sheets, a charge or credit to income tax expense included as part of net income
(loss) and may result in cash payments or receipts. Judgment includes consideration of the Company’s future cash requirements
in its tax jurisdictions. All income, capital and commodity tax filings are subject to audits and reassessments. Changes in interpretations
or judgments may result in a change in the Company’s income, capital, or commodity tax provisions in the future. The amount
of such a change cannot be reasonably estimated.
●Incremental borrowing rate for lease
The determination of the Company’s
lease obligation and right-of-use asset depends on certain assumptions, which include the selection of the discount rate. The discount
rate is set by reference to the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Significant assumptions are required to be made when
determining which borrowing rates to apply in this determination. Changes in the assumptions used may have a significant effect
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
●Going concern
The Company evaluates its ability to continue
as a going concern in accordance with ASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern. This assessment requires
significant judgment and involves the evaluation of relevant conditions and events that are known or reasonably knowable at the
date the financial statements are issued, including the Company’s current financial condition, obligations due within one
year, expected future cash flows, access to capital, and management’s plans.
The assessment involves inherent uncertainty,
as it requires management to project future conditions and the effectiveness of any plans intended to address potential liquidity
shortfalls. If substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is identified, management evaluates
whether its plans will mitigate that doubt, and appropriate disclosures are made in the financial statements.
Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of our current and former wholly owned subsidiaries, Blockchain.tv, Inc. and SovRryn Holdings Inc
(“Sovryn”). Blockchain.tv Inc. is dormant has not had operations since its inception. Sovryn is consolidated up until
January 31, 2023 and recognized as a discontinued operation. All the intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in the consolidation. The functional and reporting currency of the Company and its subsidiaries are U.S. Dollar.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are defined as components
of an entity where discrete financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how
to allocate resources and assessing performance. We identified our Chief Executive Officer as the chief operating decision maker.
We operate in one operating segment. Our operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance at the consolidated
level.
F-10
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
Leases (“Topic 842”). The new standard establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use
asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. For leases with an initial term
of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize
lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification
affecting the pattern of expense recognition. Similarly, lessors will be required to classify leases as sales-type, finance or
operating, with classification affecting the pattern of income recognition. Classification for both lessees and lessors will be
based on an assessment of whether risks and rewards as well as substantive control have been transferred through a lease contract.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal
years, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new standard April 19, 2021. We have elected not to recognize lease assets
and lease liabilities for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are non-monetary identifiable
assets, controlled by us that will produce future economic benefits, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions about conditions
that will exist over the life of the asset. An intangible asset that does not meet these attributes will be recognized as an expense
when it is incurred. Intangible assets that do, are capitalized and initially measured at cost. Those with a determinable life
will be amortized on a systematic basis over their future economic life. Those with an indefinite useful life shall not be amortized
until its useful life is determined to be longer indefinite. An intangible asset subject to amortization shall be periodically
reviewed for impairment. A recoverability test will be performed and, if applicable, unscheduled amortization is considered.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill
The carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected
to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated
by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash
flow analysis.
The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of December
31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The Company initially assesses qualitative
factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances,
the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then
the Company compares the reporting unit’s carrying amount to its fair value. If the reporting unit’s carrying amount
exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded based on that difference.
F-11
Equipment
Equipment represents purchases made for
assets, whose useful life was determined to be greater than one year. The assets are initially recorded at cost and depreciated
over their estimated useful lives.
Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets
In accordance with the provisions of ASC
Topic 360, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, all long-lived assets such as property and equipment
and intangible assets we hold and use are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of
the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of
the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.
Concentration of credit risk
We place our cash and cash equivalents
with a high credit quality financial institution. We maintain United States Dollars. We minimize its credit risks associated with
cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities. ASC
820-10 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on
the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that
may be used to measure fair value:
● Level 1 – Valuation based
on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
● Level 2 – Valuation based
on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
● Level 3 – Valuation based
on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring management’s best estimate
of what market participants would use as fair value.
In instances where the determination of
the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy
within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its
entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
Fair value estimates presented herein are
based on market assumptions and information available to management as of the reporting date. The carrying amounts of certain financial
instruments approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities or because their stated interest rates approximate
market rates. These instruments include accounts payable and accrued expenses, and interest payable on senior secured notes. This
also includes cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses that were part of the assets and liabilities of
discontinued operations.
The Company’s derivative liabilities
are carried at fair values and are classified as Level 3 financial instruments.
F-12
Convertible
notes and other debt instruments
In connection with the issuance of promissory
and convertible notes, in certain instances we issued common share purchase warrants (the "Warrants") that entitle the
holder to purchase 500,000 shares of our Common Stock at a specified fixed exercise price at any time within a time period specified
within each Warrant. We evaluated the embedded conversion feature, if any, and the warrants and concluded that they qualified as
equity instruments under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity’s
Own Equity. The fair value of the Warrants were separated from the promissory and convertible notes and accounted for as a reduction
of the carrying amount of the note with an increase to additional paid-in capital.
With respect to the embedded conversion
features in the senior secured notes, although they qualify as derivatives under ASC 815, the Company concluded that no reliable
basis exists to determine their fair value as of the reporting date. Accordingly, no value has been assigned to the conversion
features, and the derivative liability recognized pertains solely to the freestanding warrants.
The fair value of the Warrants that represented
a discount was amortized and included in the consolidated statements of operation over the term of each note using the effective
interest method.
Series A and C Convertible Preferred
Stock
The Series A and C convertible preferred
stock (“Series A Preferred Stock” and “Series C Preferred Stock”) were accounted for as mezzanine equity
and the embedded conversion feature was accounted for as derivative liabilities with change in fair value at each reporting period
end charged to the consolidated statements of operation in accordance with ASC 480 and ASC 815.
Loss per share
Net Loss Per Share
The Company has adopted the Financial Accounting
Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 260-10 which provides
for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic loss per share of common stock is computed
by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings or
loss per share of common stock is computed similarly to basic earnings or loss per share except the weighted average shares outstanding
are increased to include additional shares from the assumed exercise of any common stock equivalents, if dilutive. The Company’s
warrants and conversion features contained in notes payables are considered common stock equivalents for this purpose. Diluted
earnings is computed utilizing the treasury method for the warrants and conversion features. Diluted earnings with respect to the
convertible promissory notes utilizing the if-converted method was not applicable during the periods presented as no conditions
required for conversion had occurred. No incremental common stock equivalents were included in calculating diluted loss per share
because such inclusion would be anti-dilutive given the net loss reported for the periods presented.
F-13
Business Combinations
In accordance with ASC 805-10, “Business
Combinations”, we account for all business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, assets
and liabilities, including any remaining non-controlling interests, are recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition. The
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests
is recognized as goodwill. Certain adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets, liabilities, or non-controlling interests
made subsequent to the acquisition date, but within the measurement period, which is up to one year, are recorded as adjustments
to goodwill. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in income. Any cost or equity method interest that
we hold in the acquired company prior to the acquisition is re-measured to fair value at acquisition with a resulting gain or loss
recognized in income for the difference between fair value and the existing book value. Results of operations of the acquired entity
are included in our results from the date of the acquisition onward and include amortization expense arising from acquired tangible
and intangible assets.
Credit losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 326,
“Financial Instruments – Credit Losses”. The ASU sets forth a “current expected credit loss” (CECL)
model which requires us to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical
experience, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable
to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit
exposures. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal
years, with early adoption permitted. Recently, the FASB issued the final ASU to delay adoption for smaller reporting companies
to calendar year 2023. We have adopted the ASU in year ended December 31, 2023.
Related Party Transactions
We follow FASB ASC
subtopic 850-10, “Related Party Transactions”, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related
party transactions.
F-14
Pursuant to ASC 850-10-20, related parties include: a) our affiliates;
b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under
the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825–10–15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity;
c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship
of management; d) our principal owners; e) our management; f) other parties with which we may deal if one party controls or can
significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might
be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) other parties that can significantly influence the management
or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly
influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate
interests.
Material related party
transactions are required to be disclosed in the consolidated financial statements, other than compensation arrangements, expense
allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated
in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall
include: a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no
amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which statements of operation are presented, and such other
information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c) the dollar
amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which statements of operations are presented and the effects of any change
in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d) amounts due from or to related parties as
of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations are components
of an entity that either have been disposed or abandoned or is classified as held for sale. Additionally, in order to qualify as
a discontinued operation, the disposal or abandonment must represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on
an entity’s operations and financial results.
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with ASC 740. The Company provides for Federal, State and Provincial income taxes payable, as well as for those deferred
because of the timing differences between reporting income and expenses for consolidated financial statement purposes versus tax
purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recoverable or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or
expense in the period of the change. A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets
to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No.
2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes,
eliminates certain exceptions within ASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency
among reporting entities. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Most amendments within the
standard are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified
retrospective basis. There is no significant impact from adopting ASU 2019-12 on the Company’s financial condition, results
of operations, and cash flows.
In April 2021, The FASB issued ASU 2021-04
to codify the final consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) on how an issuer should account for modifications
made to equity-classified written call options (hereafter referred to as a warrant to purchase the issuer’s common stock).
The guidance in the ASU requires the issuer to treat a modification of an equity-classified warrant that does not cause the warrant
to become liability-classified as an exchange of the original warrant for a new warrant. This guidance applies whether the modification
is structured as an amendment to the terms and conditions of the warrant or as termination of the original warrant and issuance
of a new warrant. The Company adopted this guidance for the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2022. There is no significant impact
from adopting ASU 2021-04 on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
On March 28, 2023, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2023-01, Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements. ASU 2023-01 is designed to clarify the accounting for leasehold improvements

Note 5 Notes Receivable
On September 9, 2021, the Company received a promissory note with Top Dog Productions Inc. that was secured
by a blanket lien on all its assets.
We agreed to lend an aggregate principal sum of up to $2,000,000 that accrues at
a rate of 5% per annum. As of December 31, 2022, we advanced $527,624 and accrued $26,510 in interest receivable. Based on management’s
assessment of the collectability of the principal and interest, we recognized an allowance for the entire amount and included the
charge in bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2022.
On November 15, 2021, we received a $250,000
convertible promissory note with ZA Group Inc. for the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary, CZJ License Inc. The note accrues at
a rate of 5% per annum. The principal and accrued interest of the note receivable will be due and payable on November 5, 2023.
At any time after 180 days following the date of the note receivable, we may convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid
amount of the note into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of ZA Group Inc. at a fixed conversion price of $0.005
per share. As of December 31, 2022, based on management’s assessments of the collectability of the principal and $14,145
in accrued interest receivable and the value of ZA Group, Inc. common stock, we recognized an allowance for the $264,145 principal
and interest and included the charge in bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Note 6 Intangible Assets
The intangible assets primarily consisted
of domain names and access to a third-party streaming platform for the BCTV business, which are considered indefinite-lived
intangible assets that are not amortized, but instead are tested at least annually for impairment. Based on management’s
assessment of the lack of revenue to date and the prospects for future revenues using the intangible assets, we fully impaired
the assets and recognized an impairment charge of $197,427 in the year ended December 31, 2022.

Note 8 Derivative Liabilities
Senior Secured Notes
In connection with the issuance of senior
secured notes (see Note 12), the Company evaluated the embedded conversion features and freestanding warrants in accordance with
ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. Based on this evaluation, both instruments met the definition
of derivatives and were initially recognized as derivative liabilities.
Due to the limited trading activity and
pricing transparency of the Company’s Common Stock, observable market inputs for valuing these instruments were determined
to be unreliable. Specifically:
●The
Company’s Common Stock is listed on the OTC Expert Market, which restricts public
quotation and limits visibility to investors.
●The
average daily trading volume of the Company’s Common Stock is approximately $1,000,
and the share price has historically been highly volatile in its thinly traded status.
●Due
to these limitations, valuation techniques that depend on quoted market prices cannot
be reliably applied.
Accordingly, the Company applied a market-based valuation technique using the most recent private placement price of $0.018 per share (dated November 2, 2021) as a proxy for fair value. This valuation approach is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement within the fair value hierarchy due to the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value of the freestanding warrants as of the reporting date was estimated based on this Level 3 input, and the corresponding derivative liability has been recorded. Management believes this approach provides the most reasonable estimate of fair value in the absence of observable market data.
Significant unobservable input used in
the valuation was the private placement price of $0.018/share. No sensitivity analysis is presented due to the absence of a reliable
market range of inputs.
Although the embedded conversion features
in the senior secured notes meet the definition of derivatives under ASC 815, the Company concluded that there is no reliable
basis to estimate their fair value as of the reporting date. The features are highly sensitive to changes in various unobservable
inputs, and due to the lack of active trading, volatility benchmarks, or comparable market data, any valuation would be purely
speculative. Management assessed whether a Level 3 fair value estimate (e.g., using an option pricing model) could be developed,
but concluded that input assumptions such as volatility and market-based discount rates were not supportable. As such, no value
has been assigned to the embedded conversion features, and the recognized derivative liability pertains solely to the freestanding
warrants. The Company will reassess the valuation of the conversion features in subsequent periods as market data becomes available.
On September 24, 2021, the exercise price
of the freestanding warrants was amended to a fixed amount. As a result of this modification, the Company re-evaluated the classification
of the warrants in accordance with ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity, and determined that the amended warrants
qualified for equity classification. Accordingly, the Company derecognized the related derivative liabilities and recorded the
warrants in equity (“End of derivative warrants treatment”).

the conversion feature was determined to be derivative liabilities, and the Company recognized derivative liabilities upon issuance
of the Series A Preferred Stock accordingly.

Note 9 Securities Exchange Agreements
SovRyn Holdings, Inc
We entered into a securities exchange agreement
on February 16, 2021 with Sovryn to acquire 100% of the shares of Sovryn in exchange for (i) Jeffrey Canouse, our CEO at the time,
transferring 100 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock to a designee of Sovryn and (ii) 1,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock.
Upon the effectiveness of an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to increase our authorized common stock from 500,000,000
shares to 6,000,000,000 shares, all shares of Series E Preferred Stock issued to the shareholders were exchanged for 1,152,500
shares of our Series E-1 Preferred Stock and 1,091,388,889 shares of our Common Stock. The Series E Preferred Stock votes on an
as-converted basis with our Common Stock prior to their conversion. The Series E Preferred Stock represented approximately 59%
of the fully diluted shares of our Common Stock immediately after such shares were issued. Based on a third-party valuation, the value of the 1,000 Preferred Series
E shares was determined to be $386,221, which was recorded as an intangible asset See Note 14.
Note 10 Promissory Notes
During the years ended December 31, 2021
and 2022, the Company issued several promissory notes with warrants. The Company evaluated the warrants and concluded that those
warrants qualified as equity instruments under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and ASC 815-40,
Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity.
Due to the limited trading activity and
pricing transparency of the Company’s Common Stock, observable market inputs for valuing the warrants were determined to
be unreliable. Specifically:
●
The Company’s Common Stock is listed on the OTC Expert Market, which restricts public quotation and limits visibility to investors.
●
The average daily trading volume of the Company’s Common Stock is approximately $1,000, and the share price has historically been highly volatile in its thinly traded status.
●
Due to these limitations, valuation techniques that depend on quoted market prices cannot be reliably applied.
Accordingly, the Company applied a market-based

value. This valuation approach is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement within the fair value hierarchy due to the use of
unobservable inputs. The fair value of the freestanding warrants as of the reporting date was estimated based on this Level 3 input,
and the corresponding equity classified warrants has been recorded under additional paid-in capital. Management believes this approach
provides the most reasonable estimate of fair value in the absence of observable market data.
Significant unobservable input used in the valuation was the private placement price of $0.018/share.
No sensitivity analysis is presented due to the absence of a reliable market range of inputs.

Note 11 Convertible Notes
During the years ended December 31, 2021,
2022 and 2023, the Company issued several series of unsecured convertible notes with embedded conversion features and freestanding
warrants. The Company evaluated the embedded conversion features and the warrants and concluded that they qualified as equity instruments

Senior Secured Notes
On February 17, 2021, the Company entered
into a securities purchase agreement with funds affiliated with Arena Investors, LP (the “Investors”) pursuant to which
it issued two convertible notes having an aggregate principal amount of $16,500,000 for an aggregate purchase price of $15,000,000
(collectively, the “Notes”). The Notes are secured by a blanket lien on all of the Company’s assets and the shares
of the Company’s Common Stock and Preferred Stock (the “Pledged Assets”).
In connection with the issuance of the
Notes, the Company also issued 192,073,016 number of common share purchase warrants (the "Warrants") and 1,000 Preferred
Series F Shares to the investors (Note 14).
The Notes would mature on February 17,
2024, unless earlier converted, and accrue interest at a rate of 11% per annum, subject to increase to 20% per annum upon the occurrence
of an event of default. Interest is payable in cash on a quarterly basis, commencing on March 31, 2021.
Conversion Feature
The Notes contain conversion features that
allow the Investors to convert the Notes and unpaid interests into shares of the Company’s common stock. The conversion price is
subject to the following:
The conversion price on any conversion
date will be the lower of (1) $50,000,000 divided by the total number of outstanding shares of preferred stock, common stock, and
common stock equivalents (assuming full conversion or exercise of all securities convertible into or exercisable for equity), or
(2) $1.00.
Upon an event of default, the conversion
price will be the lower of (1) 75% of the average VWAP of the Company’s common stock over the five (5) trading days immediately
preceding the conversion date, or (2) $0.015 per share.
On September 24, 2021, the Notes were amended
to change the conversion price to $0.02.
F-28
Warrants
The Warrants entitle the Investors to purchase
shares of the Company’s common stock. At the inception of the agreement, the exercise price of the Warrants was calculated as 125%
of the base price, where the base price was determined by dividing $50,000,000 by the total number of outstanding shares of preferred
stock, common stock, and common stock equivalents (assuming the full conversion or exercise of all outstanding securities that
are convertible into or exercisable for equity securities of the Company). The exercise price is subject to adjustment as provided
in the Warrant agreement and may be paid on a cashless basis. On September 24, 2021, the exercise price of the Warrants was amended
to $0.025.
The Company evaluated the conversion feature
and warrants in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Initially, the conversion
features and warrants were determined to be derivative liabilities. However, as the Company’s common stock is quoted on the
OTC Expert Market, which lacks sufficient trading volume and transparency, management determined that reliable market inputs necessary
to support a fair value measurement were not available. As a result, the fair value of the embedded conversion features was assessed
to be nil. The fair values of the warrants of $3,464,529 were separated from the note and accounted for as a reduction of the carrying
amount of the note with a recognition of derivative liabilities (Note 8).
On September 24, 2021, upon the amendment
of the exercise price of the warrants to a fixed price, the Company re-evaluated the amended terms in accordance with ASC 815-40
Contracts In Entity’s Own Equity, derecognized the derivative liabilities related to those warrants, and recognized the Warrants
in equity (“End of derivative warrants treatment”).
The issuance of the Notes resulted in an
original issuance discount of $1,500,000. Additionally, the fair value of the Preferred Series F Shares issued in connection with
the Notes issuance and the derivative liabilities recognized were $32,229 and $3,464,529 respectively. These amounts totalling $4,996,758 was recorded as a discount to the face value of the Notes. The discount is being amortized
to consolidated statements of operations over the term of the notes using the effective interest method.
On February 1, 2023, pursuant to an agreement
with the lender of the Company’s senior secured notes, Sovryn was sold to the lender. The net assets of Sovryn at the time
of disposition totalled $9,159,907, which was used to partially settle the principal balance of the senior secured notes, which
totalled $16,500,000. The transaction was accounted for as a non-cash settlement. (Note 15)

In July 2020, pursuant to an acquisition
agreement to acquire the Casa Zeta-Jones Brand License Agreement from Luxurie Legs, LLC, the Company issued 92,999 shares of Series
A Preferred Stock and 100 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The fair values of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock issued
were $216,150 and $47,553, respectively, and were determined using a discounted cash flow method. The Company recognized an intangible
asset as a result of this share issuance.
The Company accounted for its Series A
Preferred Stock as Mezzanine Equity in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. The embedded conversion
feature of the preferred stock was evaluated under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and was separated from the host instrument.
This embedded conversion feature was recognized as a derivative liability, with changes in its fair value recorded in the consolidated
statements of operations at each reporting period end. Upon the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Company recognized
derivative liabilities of $58,545. For the year ended December 31, 2020, a gain of $20,657 resulting from the change in the fair
value of these derivative liabilities was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations (Note 8).
The Series B Preferred Stock was accounted
for as Permanent Equity in accordance with ASC 480 - Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. The fair value of the Series B Preferred
Stock was allocated to par value of $Nil and additional paid-in capital of $47,553.

all outstanding shares of its Series A Preferred Stock. In exchange, the former holders received one-year options to purchase up

fair value of the options issued was $21,465 and was included in additional paid-in capital. This transaction resulted in the derecognition
of both the derivative liabilities and the Series A Preferred Stock. The difference between the combined carrying value of the
derecognized derivative liabilities and Series A Preferred Stock and the $21,465 fair value of the options issued resulted in a
gain on extinguishment of $194,685, which was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December
31, 2021. Separately, a loss of $20,657 resulting from the change in fair value of the derivative liabilities was recorded in the

In determining the fair value of these
equity-classified features, the Company considered the fact that its common stock is quoted on the OTC Expert Market, where trading
volume is minimal and pricing is not reliably observable. Due to the absence of active market inputs, the Company determined that
a quoted market price could not be used to value the conversion features.
Instead, the Company referred to the most
recent observable transaction price from a private placement conducted in 2021, in which it issued 4,600 shares of Series G Preferred
Stock for total proceeds of $4,600,000. On November 2, 2021, these preferred shares were converted into 255,555,556 shares of common
stock, implying an effective per-share price of $0.018. The Company used this price as the best available input to support the
fair value assessment.
Note 15 Discontinued Operations
In the fourth quarter of 2022, management
determined that Sovryn’s television broadcast business was not an efficient use of resources in light of the Company’s
strategic focus on developing and launching its core business, BCTV. As a result, management initiated a plan to exit the Sovryn
business and reallocate resources toward BCTV, including repayment of senior debt associated with the acquisition and operation
of Sovryn.
Accordingly, the operations of Sovryn have
been classified as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December
31, 2023 and 2022, in accordance with ASC 205-20.
On February 1, 2023, pursuant to an agreement
with the lender of the Company’s senior secured notes, Sovryn was sold to the lender. The net assets of Sovryn at the time
of disposition totalled $9,159,907, which was used to partially settle the principal balance of the senior secured notes, which
totalled $16,500,000. The transaction was accounted for as a non-cash settlement.
Sovryn’s operating results prior to disposition, as well as any related expenses, were recorded
as part of the net loss from discontinued operations and included in the consolidated statements of operations. The following
is a summary of Sovryn for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
In connection with the preparation of this
annual report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out by the sole member of our Board of Directors and our Chief Executive
Officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act as of December 31, 2022. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Based on that evaluation, our management
concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in
recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the
SEC rules and forms and that such information was accumulated or communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In particular, we identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, as discussed
below.
Management’s Report on Internal
Controls over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our internal
control framework over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”). Internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
●
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
●
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors; and
●
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
29
Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management conducted an assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal
Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).
As a result of this assessment, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.
A material weakness is a control deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
The matters involving internal controls
and procedures that management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and no outside directors on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties
consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with
respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period
end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified and communicated to management
in connection with the preparation and audit of our financial statements as of December 31, 2022, and the preparation of our 2023
quarterly financial statements.
As a result of the material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting described above, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued
by COSO.
Management believes that the material weaknesses
set forth in items (2), (3) and (4) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the
lack of a functioning audit committee and no outside directors on our Board of Directors caused and continues to cause an ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of the required internal controls over financial reporting.
We are committed to improving our financial
organization. As part of this commitment and when funds are available, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent
with control objectives and will increase its personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function
by: (i) appointing additional outside directors to its board of directors who will also be appointed to our audit committee, resulting
in a fully functioning audit committee that will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal
controls over financial reporting; and (ii) preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists that will set
forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure
requirements.
Management believes that the appointment
of additional outside directors, who will also be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning
audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. In addition, management believes that preparing and
implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses: (i) insufficient written
policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and
SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further, management
believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation
of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training
needed to support our internal controls if personnel turn-over issues within the department occur. This, coupled with the appointment
of additional outside directors, is designed to greatly decrease any control and procedure issues we may encounter in the future.
30
Management will continue to monitor and
evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further
action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.
Our independent auditors have not issued
an attestation report on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, this Annual
Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. We are not required to have, nor have we, engaged our independent registered public accounting firm to perform
an audit of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only
management’s report in this annual report.
Changes in Internal Controls
There were no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the year ended December 31, 2022, that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B. Other Information
None.
Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign
Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.
Not applicable.

PART III
Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers,
and Corporate Governance.
(a) Identify Directors and Executive
Officers
Mr. Amon, currently the sole member of
the Board of Directors, holds office until (i) the next annual meeting of the stockholders, (ii) his successor has been duly elected
and qualified, or (iii) his resignation.
As of the date of this Annual Report, Madison’s
management team consists solely of Mr. Amon, who serves as the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and sole director. Mr. Amon was appointed to such positions in connection
with the Change of Control on November 6, 2023
Mr. Amon, age 76, is a corporate and M&A
specialist with over 40 years’ experience representing small and medium sized companies and investment funds. Over the past
five years, Mr. Amon has operated a law practice, the Law Office of Thomas Amon, until June 1, 2023 when he began working at Praetor
Legal Services. From July 2020 until July 31, 2023, Mr. Amon served on the board of Everything Blockchain, Inc. For the past 15
years, Mr. Amon has also served as President of Spoleto Corporation. Mr. Amon also serves as a board member of a number of charitable
institutions located in New York City and New England. Mr. Amon is a securities lawyer by trade and is licensed to practice in
the State of New York. He graduated from Harvard College received his J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law. The Company
believes that Mr. Amon’s legal expertise in corporate and mergers and acquisitions matters for small and medium sized public
and private companies and his role as a licensed practicing lawyer provide him with the requisite qualifications and skills to
serve as a member of the Board of Directors.
(b) Identify Significant Employees
Other than Mr. Amon, we have no significant
employees as of the date of this Annual Report.
(c) Family Relationships
There are no family relationships among
the directors, executive officers or persons nominated or chosen by us to become directors or executive officers.
(d) Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings
To the best of our knowledge, and except
as set forth below, none of our current directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years:
●
Been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);
●
Had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation, or business association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time;
●
Been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity;
●
Been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;
●
Been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or
●
Been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.
Except as may
be set forth in our discussion below in “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions,” none of our directors or
executive officers has been involved in any transactions with us or any of our directors, executive officers, affiliates, or associates
which are required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Certain Legal Proceedings involving
Mr. Falcone
On September 16, 2013, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final Judgment (the “Final Judgment”) approving a settlement
between the SEC and Harbinger Capital, Harbinger Capital Partners Special Situations GP, LLC, Harbinger Capital Partners Offshore
Manager, L.L.C., and Philip A. Falcone (collectively, the “HCP Parties”), in connection with two civil actions previously
filed against the HCP Parties by the SEC. One civil action alleged that Harbinger Capital Partners Special Situations GP, LLC,
Harbinger Capital Partners Offshore Manager, L.L.C., and Mr. Falcone violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities
laws by engaging in market manipulation in connection with the trading of the debt securities of a particular issuer from 2006
to 2008. The other civil action alleged that Harbinger Capital and Mr. Falcone violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal
securities laws in connection with a loan made by Harbinger Capital Partners Special Situations Fund, L.P. to Mr. Falcone in October
2009 and in connection with the circumstances and disclosure regarding alleged preferential treatment of, and agreements with,
certain fund investors.
The Final Judgment barred and enjoined
Mr. Falcone for a period of five years (after which he may seek to have the bar and injunction lifted) from acting as or being
an associated person of any “broker,” “dealer,” “investment adviser,” “municipal securities
dealer,” “municipal adviser,” “transfer agent,” or “nationally recognized statistical rating
organization.” During the period of the bar, Mr. Falcone may remain associated with Harbinger Capital and certain other Harbinger
Capital-related entities; provided that, during such time, Mr. Falcone’s association will be limited as set forth in the
Final Judgment. The HCP Parties must take all actions reasonably necessary to expeditiously satisfy all redemption requests of
investors in the Harbinger Capital-related funds, which may include the orderly disposition of Harbinger Capital-related fund assets.
In addition, during the bar period, the HCP Parties and certain Harbinger Capital-related entities may not raise new capital or
make capital calls from existing investors. The Final Judgment required the HCP Parties to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest,
and civil penalties totaling approximately $18 million. In addition, certain of the activities of the HCP Parties at the Harbinger
Capital-related funds were subject to the oversight of an independent monitor for two years.
32
Additionally, on October 7, 2013, HRG,
Fidelity & Guaranty Life (f/k/a, Harbinger F&G, LLC, “FGL”), a subsidiary of HRG Group, Inc. (f/k/a Harbinger
Group Inc., an entity in which Mr. Falcone use to serve as CEO and a director, “HRG”), Fidelity & Guaranty Life
Insurance Company of New York (“FGL NY Insurance”), a subsidiary of FGL, and Mr. Falcone delivered a commitment (the
“NYDFS Commitment”) to the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) pursuant to which
Mr. Falcone agreed for a period of up to seven years that he will not, directly or indirectly, individually or through any person
or entity, exercise control (within the meaning of New York Insurance Law Section 1501(a)(2)) over FGL NY Insurance or any other
New York-licensed insurer. In connection with the NYDFS Commitment, neither Mr. Falcone nor any employee of Harbinger Capital,
may (i) serve as a director or officer of FGL or (ii) be involved in making investment decisions for FGL’s portfolio of assets
or any funds withheld account supporting credit for reinsurance for FGL. The NYDFS Commitment provides that: (i) Mr. Falcone may
continue to own any direct or indirect interest in HRG and serve as an officer or director of HRG and (ii) HRG may continue to
own any direct or indirect interest in FGL NY Insurance and any other New York-licensed insurer. Any other activities related solely
to FGL (other than FGL NY Insurance) are not prohibited and HRG executives may continue to serve on FGL’s board of directors.
In addition, in connection with its re-domestication to Iowa, on October 7, 2013, Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company
(“FGL Insurance”), a subsidiary of FGL, agreed to the conditions set by the Iowa Insurance Commissioner that neither
Mr. Falcone nor any employees of Harbinger Capital may serve as an officer or director of FGL Insurance or FGL (but FGL Insurance
may request that the Iowa Insurance Division lift this restriction after five years) and neither Mr. Falcone nor Harbinger Capital
will be involved in making investment decisions for FGL Insurance or any funds withheld account that supports credit for reinsurance
for FGL Insurance for five years. Our Insurance Company is not licensed to operate in New York State, and does not currently operate
in New York State; therefore, the ban does not apply to our Insurance Company.
In addition, Mr. Falcone is a named defendant
in litigation in connection with certain personal financial matters. We understand that Mr. Falcone continues to vigorously pursue
his defense in connection with these matters.
On November 6, 2023, in connection with
the Change of Control, the shareholders of the Company removed Mr. Falcone and Warren Zenna as our directors and appointed Thomas
Amon as the sole member of the Board of Directors. Mr. Amon removed all Company officers and appointed himself as the Company’s
President, Secretary, Treasurer, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer.
(e) Compliance with Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act.
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires
directors, executive officers and 10% or greater shareholders of us to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership (Form 3)
and reports of changes in ownership of our equity securities (Form 4 and Form 5) and to provide copies of all such Forms as filed
to us. Based solely on our review of copies of the reports filed with the SEC and the written representations of our directors
and executive officers, we believe that all reporting requirements for the year ended December 31, 2022 were complied with by each
person who at any time during the year ended December 31, 2022 was a director or an executive officer of the Company, or held more
than 10% of our Common Stock, except for the following: one Form 4 not filed by Warren Zenna reporting one transaction and four
Form 4s not filed by Korr Value LP reporting four transactions.
(f) Code of Ethics
We adopted a code of ethics that applies
to all of our executive officers and employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. See Exhibit
14 of this Annual Report for a copy of such code of ethics. Management believes our code of ethics is reasonably designed to deter
wrongdoing and promote honest and ethical conduct; provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in public
reports; comply with applicable laws; ensure prompt internal reporting of code violations; and provide accountability for adherence
to the code.
33
(g) Nomination Procedure for Directors
We do not have a standing nominating committee;
recommendations for candidates to stand for election as directors are made by the Board of Directors. We have not adopted a policy
that permits shareholders to recommend candidates for election as directors or a process for shareholders to send communications
to the Board of Directors.
(h) Audit Committee
We do not have a separately designated
standing audit committee. Rather, our sole director currently performs the required functions of an audit committee. See “Item
12. (c) Director independence” below for more information on independence.
Our audit committee is responsible for:
(1) selection and oversight of our independent accountant; (2) establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment
of complaints regarding accounting, internal controls and auditing matters; (3) establishing procedures for the confidential, anonymous
submission by our employees of concerns regarding accounting and auditing matters; (4) engaging outside advisors; and, (5) funding
for the outside auditor and any outside advisors engaged by the audit committee.
As of December 31, 2023, we did not have
a written audit committee charter or similar document.
(i) Audit Committee Financial Expert
We have no financial expert. Management
believes the cost related to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive and has determined that the cost of hiring
a financial expert to act as a director and to be a member of an audit committee or otherwise perform audit committee functions
outweighs the benefits of having a financial expert.
(j) Insider Trading Policy
We intend to have our Board of Directors
adopt an insider trading policy to promote compliance with federal and state securities laws that prohibit certain persons who
are aware of material nonpublic information about a company from (i) trading in securities of that company, or (ii) providing material
nonpublic information to other persons who may trade on the basis of that information.
We have not yet adopted an insider trading
policy because we have just recently reshaped our Board of Directors that would advise on such policies in connection with the
Change of Control.

On February 15, 2021, we entered into a Consultant Agreement with GreenRock LLC, to retain Mr. Falcone, its Managing Member, to serve as a consultant to us and advise on all matters typically considered and decided upon by executive management and our board of directors, and additionally to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. We compensated GreenRock LLC $35,000 and $925,972 for its services provided in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
We have structured our compensation with
the following objectives in mind:
●
offer competitive compensation to attract and retain highly qualified leaders to guide and govern;
●
recognize the substantial investment of time and expertise necessary for the employees to discharge their duties; and
●
ensure that compensation is easy to understand and is regarded positively by our shareholders and employees.
Our executive compensation framework is
designed to continue to align and promote the alignment of pay and performance to the benefit of our shareholders.
35
Since our inception, no stock options,
stock appreciation rights, or long-term incentive plans have been granted, exercised or repriced.
Currently, there are no arrangements between
us and any of its directors whereby such directors are compensated for any services provided as directors.
There are no employment agreements between
us and any named executive officer, and there are no employment agreements or other compensating plans or arrangements with regard
to any named executive officer which provide for specific compensation in the event of resignation, retirement, other termination
of employment or from a change of control or from a change in a named executive officer’s responsibilities following a change
in control.
Director Compensation for Fiscal
Year Ended 2023
During the year
ended December 31, 2023, our non-employee director, Warren Zenna, was not paid any compensation in connection with his services
to the Board of Directors. For compensation paid to our other directors during the year ended December 31, 2023, see the Summary
Compensation table in this Item 11 above.
Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain
Beneficial Holders and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
The following table sets forth, as of
August 21, 2025, information regarding beneficial ownership of our capital stock by:
●
each person, or group of affiliated persons, known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding voting securities;
●
each of our named executive officers;
●
each of our directors; and
●
all of our named executive officers and directors as a group.
Beneficial ownership is determined
according to the rules of the SEC and generally means that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if he, she or it
possesses sole or shared voting or investment power of that security, including securities that are exercisable for shares of
Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series E-1 Preferred Stock within sixty (60) days of August 21,
2025. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the holders
named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of Common Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series E-1 Preferred Stock shown that they beneficially own, subject to community property laws where
applicable.
For purposes of computing the percentage of outstanding shares of our Common Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series E-1 Preferred Stock held by each holder or group of holders named above, any shares of Common
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series E-1 Preferred Stock that such holder or holders have the right to acquire
within sixty (60) days of August 21, 2025 is deemed to be outstanding, but is not deemed to be outstanding for the
purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other holder. The inclusion herein of any shares of Common Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock or Series E-1 Preferred Stock listed as beneficially owned does not constitute an
admission of beneficial ownership. Unless otherwise identified, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table
below is c/o Madison Technologies Inc., 2500 Westchester Avenue, Suite 401, Purchase, New York 10577.

(1) Based on 1,603,095,243 shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding as of August 21, 2025.
(2) The 100 shares of Series B Preferred
Stock are not convertible, however such shares enable the holder thereof to cast a number of votes equal to 51% of all voting shares
of each class of the Company’s capital stock, including but not limited to, the shares of Common Stock and of the Series
E-1 Preferred Stock.
(3) Each share of Series E-1 Preferred
Stock converts into 1,000 shares of Common Stock and votes with the shares of Common Stock on an as-converted to Common Stock basis.
Although conversions of such shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock have not yet occurred, the Series E-1 Certificate requires the
shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock to automatically convert two years from the date of their initial issuance, which occurred
in September 2021. Accordingly, such shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock are considered converted for purposes of the number of
shares of Common Stock owned and percentage ownership.

voting power with respect to all shares of Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series E-1 Preferred Stock.
(5) Arena Investors, LP’s (“Arena”)

I, LP (“Arena Partners”), a fund for which Arena acts as investment manager and whose securities Arena has sole voting
control and investment discretion over; (ii) 49,761,877 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Arena Special Opportunities
Fund, LP (“Arena Opportunities”), a fund for which Arena acts as investment manager and whose securities Arena has
sole voting control and investment discretion over; (iii) an aggregate of 1,042,983,889 shares of Common Stock, which Arena obtained
voting and investment control in connection with the Change of Control and the acquisition of the Pledged Interests, of which (x)
388,150,556 shares had previously been deemed beneficially owned by FFO1 and Mr. Falcone prior to the Change of Control, (y) 436,555,556
shares had previously been deemed beneficially owned by FFO2 and Mr. Falcone prior to the Change of Control and (z) 218,277,777
shares had previously been deemed beneficially owned by Korr Value LP and Kenneth Orr (collectively, “Korr”) prior
to the Change of Control; (iv) 100 shares of Series B Preferred Stock beneficially owned by Portents Holdings, LLC (“Portents”),
a fund for which Arena acts as investment manager and whose securities Arena has sole voting control and investment discretion
over, which shares were deemed beneficially owned by FFO1 and Mr. Falcone prior to the Change of Control and were included in the
Pledged Interests; (v) an aggregate of 1,152,500 shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock held by Portents, which shares were deemed
beneficially owned by each of FFO1, FFO2, Mr. Falcone and Korr prior to the Change of Control and were included in the Pledged
Interests. Such beneficial ownership excludes (i) a Common Stock purchase warrant exercisable for up to 129,265,140.441 shares
of Common Stock held by Arena Partners, and (ii) a Common Stock purchase warrant exercisable for up to 62,807,875.559 shares of
Common Stock held by Arena Opportunities, which warrants contain 4.99% beneficial ownership limitations preventing their exercise
by the holders thereof as a result of the number of shares beneficially owned by Arena.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions, and Director Independence.
(a) Transactions with Related Persons
Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into
a management consulting agreement with GreenRock LLC, a company controlled by Mr. Falcone, for a period of one year ending December
31, 2022, pursuant to which we provided monthly remuneration of $35,000, plus expenses in connection with his duties, responsibilities
and performance as our chief executive officer. In February 2021, Sovryn entered into a consulting agreement with GreenRock LLC
to provide us with chief executive officer services. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we paid GreenRock LLC $35,000
and $420,000 in fees, respectively. Mr. Falcone is the managing member of GreenRock LLC and is our former Chief Executive Officer.
We paid GreenRock LLC bonuses of $Nil and $505,972 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
Apart from the above, since the beginning
of the year ended December 31, 2023, no director, executive officer, security holder, or any immediate family of such director,
executive officer, or security holder has had any direct or indirect material interest in any transaction or currently proposed
transaction, which we were or are to be a participant, that exceeded the lesser of (1) $120,000 or (2) one percent of the average
of our total assets at year-end for the last three completed fiscal years.
(c) Director independence
Mr. Amon is the sole member of our Board
of Directors. Pursuant to Item 407(a)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act, our Board of Directors has adopted the definition
of “independent director” as set forth in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. In summary,
an “independent director” means a person other than an executive officer or employee of Madison or any other individual
having a relationship which, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment
in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, and includes any director who accepted any compensation from us in excess of
$200,000 during any period of twelve consecutive months with the three past fiscal years. The ownership of our stock will not preclude
a director from being independent.
In applying this definition, our Board
of Directors has determined that Mr. Amon does not qualify as an “independent director” pursuant to such Rule 4200(a)(15).
As of the date of this Annual Report, we
did not maintain a separately designated audit, compensation or nominating committee. We intend to adopt this definition of independence
for the members of our audit committee once formed.
Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and
Services
(1) Audit Fees
The aggregate fees billed for each of the
last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statements
and for the review of financial statements included in our Form 10-Qs or services that are normally provided by the accountant
in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years was:
December 31, 2023 -
$0 – SRCO
December 31, 2022 -
$0 – SRCO
(2) Audit-Related Fees
The aggregate fees billed in each of the
last two fiscal years for assurance and related services by the principal accountants that are reasonably related to the performance
of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported in the preceding paragraph:
December 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022 - $Nil – SRCO
(3) Tax Fees
The aggregate fees billed in each of the
last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning
was:
December 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022 - $Nil – SRCO
(4) All Other Fees
The aggregate fees billed in each of the
last two fiscal years for the products and services provided by the principal accountant, other than the services reported in paragraphs
(1), (2), and (3) of this Item 14 was:
December 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022 - $Nil – SRCO
38
(5) In
lieu of an Audit Committee, our sole director pre-approves all audit and non-audit
services provided by the independent auditors prior to the engagement of the independent auditors with respect to such services.
(6) The percentage of hours expended
on the principal accountant’s engagement to audit our financial statements for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed
to work performed by persons other than the principal accountant’s full time, permanent employees was nil %.
Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit
and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditors
Given the fact that we currently have only
one director, as well as our limited financial resources and operational state, our sole director must serve in the role of an
audit committee. Our sole director pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services. These services may include audit
services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. Our sole director approves these services on a case-by-case
basis.
Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement
Schedules.
(a). Financial Statements
Our consolidated financial statements have
been included in Item 8 above.
