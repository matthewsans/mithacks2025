​EXPLANATORY NOTEMcEwen Mining Inc. (the “Company”) is filing this Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A (this “Amendment”) to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 14, 2025 (the “Original Filing”) to amend Item 15 of Part IV of the Original Filing, pursuant to Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, to include the financial statements and related notes of Minera Santa Cruz S.A (“MSC”), a significant equity investee in which the Company holds a 49% equity ownership interest. In addition, the Company is filing the consent of the independent auditors of MSC and, as required by Rule 12b-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), new certifications by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X provides that if a 50%-or-less-owned person accounted for by the equity method meets the first or third condition of the significant subsidiary tests set forth in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X, substituting 20% for 10%, separate financial statements for such 50%-or-less-owned person shall be filed. These financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) or IFRS Accounting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). MSC met the significant subsidiary test described above for the Company’s fiscal years ending December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and accordingly, the Company has included in this Amendment the required Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related Statements of Profit (Loss) and Other Comprehensive Income, Statements of Changes in Equity, and Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and the accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements of MSC, prepared in accordance with IFRS. We caution readers that the MSC financial results included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in accordance with US GAAP and may therefore differ from the MSC results presented as separate financial statements reported under IFRS. ​No attempt has been made in this Amendment to modify or update the disclosures in the Original Filing except as required to reflect the effect of the revisions discussed herein. Except as otherwise noted herein, this Amendment continues to describe conditions as of the date of the Original Filing and the disclosures contained herein have not been updated to reflect events, results or developments that occurred after the date of the Original Filing, or to modify or update those disclosures affected by subsequent events. Among other things, forward-looking statements made in the Original Filing and Prior Amendment have not been revised to reflect events, results or developments that occurred or facts that became known to us after the date of the Original Filing, and such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our filings with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the Original Filing. Accordingly, this Amendment should be read in conjunction with the Original Filing and the Company’s other filings with the SEC subsequent to March 14, 2025. Furthermore, readers are cautioned to review the reliability of information disclosure, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, pertaining to the disclosure of MSC results.​2
