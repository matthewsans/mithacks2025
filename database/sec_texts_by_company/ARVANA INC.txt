Overview
Arvana
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 16, 1977, as “Turinco, Inc.” to engage in any legal undertaking. On July
24, 2006, Arvana changed its name from Turinco, Inc. to Arvana Inc. on the acquisition of Arvana Networks, Inc., a telecommunications
business. We discontinued efforts related to that business as of December 31, 2009. Arvana acquired Down 2 Fish Charters, LLC on February
3, 2023. Down2Fish was organized under the laws of the State of Florida on April 1, 2019.
Arvana
acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of Down2Fish on February 3, 2023, from LCF Salons, LLC, (“LCF”) in exchange
for fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) and a secured promissory note (“Note”) in the amount of seven hundred thousand dollars
($700,000) payable twenty-four (24) months after the closing date that bears interest of seven and one quarter percent (7¼%) per
annum. Interest on the promissory note is payable on an annual basis. The parties have agreed to extend the maturity date of the Note
to August 15, 2025.
Stockholders
approved a forward stock split of Arvana’s common shares on a 3-for-1 basis effected on April 19, 2023, to stockholders of record
on March 31, 2023. All changes in Arvana’s capital structure have been given retroactive effect in this annual report.
While
Arvana operates its fishing charter business it has continued to seek business opportunities in real estate development. On December 12,
2023, Arvana announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding to acquire the business of FirstShot Centers, LLC (“FirstShot”),
a Nevada based company intent on expanding its specialty use concept to acquire and repurpose vacant shopping malls, outlet locations
and big box stores throughout the United States to attract new tenants from targeted industries that offer goods or services that are
not available online. The parties are yet to enter into a definitive agreement pending delivery of the FirstShot business and financing
plan.

History
Down2Fish
operates a Florida based fishing charter business that offers a range of curated maritime adventures that include inshore, offshore,
and custom charters for fishing enthusiasts, nature lovers and tourists. The business is operated from a private dock in Palmetto, Florida
that services the Tampa Bay area in addition to St Petersburg, Sarasota, Venice, Port Charlotte, and Clearwater. Down2Fish generates
revenue from the sale and provision of fishing charter services.
Services
Down2Fish
offers the following service options for seaborne adventures:
•inshore/coastal
fishing boat charter services;
•offshore
fishing boat charter services.
•sight-seeing
fishing boat charter services; and
•custom
fishing boat chart services.
In-shore
fishing charters are an excellent way to experience deep-sea fishing off the Florida Gulf coast without spending the day motoring out
to the open sea and back again. Customers get the full experience of baiting their line, casting, hooking, and landing a real live Gulf
water fish, all within sight of shore. We offer in-shore charters as full or half-day adventures that includes exploring flats and bays
up to three miles from the beach. May, June, and July are the best months for inshore fishing in the Tampa Bay area. Popular inshore
fish species include mangrove snapper, snook, redfish, tarpon, and cobia. Fishing lessons are included on our charters along with help
in cleaning the catch.
An
offshore deep-sea fishing charter is designed to be an immersive experience. Charters are all-day trips that travel up to eighty miles
offshore to open waters off the Florida Gulf coast, that are home to large fish, up to 50lbs or more including red grouper, scamp grouper,
gag grouper, mahi mahi, American red snapper, red porgy, greater amberjack, blackfin tuna, various shark species, king mackerel, jack
crevalle, and cobia. The skills required for deep-sea fishing can be more challenging than that required for in-shore fishing and the
equipment more exhaustive to use. Fishing lessons for inexperienced deep-sea anglers are often a good part of the charter. We offer deep-sea
fishing all year round subject to weather conditions.
Sight-seeing
charters specialize in taking customers out on local waterways on guided tours of aquatic and terrestrial points of interest. This type
of charter works well in tourist destinations such as Tampa.
Custom
or special event charters are all-day trips designed to commemorate special events such as weddings, corporate outings, or birthday parties
that can combine in-shore and off-shore fishing charters. Customers can choose from a variety of activities and sight-seeing options
tailored to specific requests.
2
We
intend to offer dolphin watching charters as the means to grow the Down2Fish brand in the Greater Tampa area and are exploring the possibilities
for offering whale watching charters. The Tampa Bay area is ideal for dolphin spotting as many dolphins live in shallow waters close
to the coastline. Dolphin tours are popular with families and groups. However, Down2Fish will need a larger vessel that can carry more
clients to initiate dolphin watching charters. North Atlantic right whales can be sporadically spotted from November to April calving
in waters off the Florida Gulf coast. Given that right whales potting in Florida is a rarity, we are unaware of any fishing charter companies
in Florida that offer whale watching tours so to offer this service could quickly help us distinguish the Down2Fish brand.
Industry
The
fishing charter industry consists of businesses that engage in services such as inshore/coastal fishing, offshore fishing, and tournament
fishing. Operators provide charter boat services for individuals, parties, and companies. Operators may vary greatly in size, ranging
from large operators with a fleet of vessels to single boat owner-operators and part-time charter companies. The industry has seen faltering
growth over the past five years. COVID-19was the primary disruption that resulted in a significant decline in domestic tourism.
The
IBISWorld report dated to September 2023 explains the fishing charter industry has experienced a moderate decline over the last five
years. Overall revenue was estimated to drop at an annualized rate of 4.8% through that period to $440.3 million. Despite the fall in
revenue, the IBIS World report added that the number of charter boat businesses grew by 2.4% to 3,649, and the number of charter boat
employees grew by 1.4% to 5,753 during the prior five years to September 2023. While the fishing charter industry benefited from a recovering
economy in 2021 post pandemic, rising inflation in 2022, dampened growth through 2023. The reports notes that the fishing charter industry
continues to face stiff competition from other recreational activities such as hiking, running, and video games along with a negative
shift in consumer confidence. Inflation has caused consumers to save more of their earnings in response economic uncertainty which sentiment
has had a chilling effect on the demand for fishing charter boat services.
Looking
ahead, the IBIS World report for the fishing charter business has forecast an increase in revenue at an annualized rate of 3.0% to $511.3
over the next five years as disposable income is expected to increase in a tight labor market, which development will likely provide
consumers with more discretionary income for recreational services such as fishing charters.
Competition
While
no single participant in the fishing charter business holds a dominant share of the available market, we do nonetheless face intense
competition. Competitors range from industry operators that maintain fleets of vessels, to single vessel owner-operators and part-time
charter companies. Existing and prospective competitors have or could have advantages over us such as those with greater name recognition,
longer operating histories, deeper service offerings, larger customer bases, substantially greater financial or other resources. Many
of our competitors offer fishing charters at a low-cost that may be difficult or impossible for us to match and are able to book fishing
charters directly from their own e-commerce websites as compared to our reliance on third-party booking sites or services to accept payment,
all of which are paid a fee for each engagement.
3
We
are faced with a bevy of competitors in the Tampa Bay area that include:
•Queen
Fleet Deep Sea Fishing based in Clearwater, Florida, a family-owned business that has offered
fishing charters for over sixty years. Service offerings include charters for up to 150 persons
on “fishing party boats” for half day excursions, and on smaller charters for
up to 85 persons on all day fishing excursions. The business maintains two of the larger
fishing party boats and one vessel for all day fishing charters.
•Poseidon
Fishing Charters that operate from Tampa Bay offers specific charters to fish for specific
fish species, such as goliath grouper fishing or shark fishing, night fishing and firework
sight-seeing tours. Poseidon Fishing also offers a summer camp for children, merchandise,
and special pricing for time sensitive charters.
•Florida
Reels Fishing Charters offers a variety of pick-up locations along the Gulf Coast that is
operated by a single owner-operator with one custom built vessel. The business emphasizes
its use of top fishing equipment and reliance on knowledge-based fishing derived from years
spent fishing in the area.
While
this list of competitors is in no way exhaustive it does provide a snapshot of competition in the area and some of the distinguishing
characteristics used by these competitors to attract fishing charters.
Our
competitive weaknesses are tied to our limited operating history and the size of our operation. Since we are relatively new to operating
in the Tampa Bay area, our business struggles with brand recognition in a market filled with options. We expect that the implementation
of our business plan will increase brand recognition and customers for our fishing charters. However, efforts to expand brand recognition
require that we overcome our biggest competitive weakness that being the limited financial resources at our disposal. Material growth
will depend, in no small part on our ability to purchase an additional vessel to host dolphin sightseeing charters, and our willingness
to spend additional sums on marketing our charters. We do not presently have the funds necessary to purchase a suitable dolphin sightseeing
vessel, or to boost marketing efforts.
Despite
the nature of the fishing charter industry and our competitive weaknesses, we believe that the services we offer today will continue
to compete effectively due to several factors. We have a team with excellent experience in the fishing charter industry that provides
the core strength of our workforce. Aside from the synergies that exist in our carefully selected workforce, our charters are guided
by best practices in the industry. Our captain is at the top of the range for expertise in running fishing charters. Another of our strengths
is our location in Palmetto, Florida with easy access to the Florida Gulf Coast, an area extremely popular for anglers and tourists alike.
The state-of-art condition of our fishing boats and fishing equipment is an attraction for customers. Another of our strengths is our
attention to fishing rules and regulations focused on preserving the environment. Our concern for the environment is not lost on customers
who are increasingly focused on enjoying nature without causing harm in the process. We are also cost competitive with other fishing
charter businesses in the area.
Market
Analysis
The
fishing charter industry competes with a wide variety of other recreational activities that include non-fishing sightseeing, land-based
recreation such as hiking, city sightseeing, and even sporting events. A research report published by IBISWorld in 2018 reported that
during the five years that preceded that year, the industry lost ground to other forms of recreation as consumer preferences changed.
The COVID-19 pandemic had a further chilling effect on the industry as prospective customers were bound to remain in their homes. However,
a post-COVID-19 IBISWorld report on the fishing charter industry released in September of 2023 forecasts that the industry is expected
to realize annualized revenue growth through 2028, on the basis that sustained economic growth will lead to an increase in consumer incomes
which will enable more people to spend more money on recreational activities. Despite the effects of inflation, there is reason to believe
that the fishing charter industry is about to enter a consistent growth pattern in the face of competing recreational activities.

Marketing
Strategy
Our
marketing strategies are directed towards achieving specific objectives that support our strategic goals to create new market channels,
increase revenue and grow market share. We expect to leverage off premier fishing charter experiences to win new customers and retain
existing ones. Down2Fish maintains modern well equipped fishing charter vessels, experienced crews, a convenient location from which
to embark on charters, and reliance on highly reliable payment platforms for payment. Our intention is also to work with brand and publicity
consultants to help us map out publicity and advertising strategies that will help us reach our target market.
We
expect to continue to make use of the following marketing and sales strategies:
•promote
our business online via our official website and social media platforms like; Instagram,
Facebook, twitter, YouTube, Google, LinkedIn + et al;
•offer
Down2Fish branded merchandise online and aboard our fishing charters;
•advertise
special prices;
•advertise
our fishing boat charter in our official website and employ strategies that will help us
pull traffic to the site;
•promote
our business on fishing charter booking sites such as Fareharbor, Travelocity, and Fishing
Booker; and
•dress
crew members in branded shirts with our company logo.
Our
pricing is similar to the average price of what is charged for a fishing charter. While we do not charge more than our competitors, we
do not chargeless. Nonetheless, we do intend to offer discounts on our fishing charters for special events, and to reward loyal customers
especially for referrals to our business.
Our
facility to accept payments is all inclusive, as we are quite aware that different customers prefer different payment options such as:
•payment
via bank transfer
•payment
with cash
•payment
via Point-of-Sale Machine (POS)
•payment
via credit card.
Governmental
Regulation
Our
business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulations in Florida.
The
captain of a saltwater fishing charter must comply with U.S. Coast Guard (“USGC”) regulations which include holding a USGC
Captain’s License. Vessels used by a charter captain to do business must be commercially registered or have a USGC certificate
of documentation with a commercial designation and follow USGC vessel safety requirements. Vessels carrying more than six passengers
for hire must also have a Certificate of Inspection issued by the USGC. The USGC also exercises full authority over the safety and health
of crews aboard vessels that have been inspected and certified. Any safety or health complaints received by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (“OSHA”) concerning crew working conditions on an inspected vessel are referred to the USGC for determination
of whether the events complained of constitute hazardous conditions. Fishing charters conducted in the Gulf of Mexico are also required
to hold Gulf of Mexico Charter/Headboat for Reef Fish, and a Gulf of Mexico Charter/Headboat for Coastal Migratory Pelagics permits issued
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”). Enforcement falls on the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement.
5
Florida
requires a Charter Captain or Boat Fishing License to carry paying customers for the purpose of taking, attempting to take or possessing
saltwater fish or organisms. A Florida Charter Captain license also covers customers on a charter who are not required to hold separate
recreational saltwater fishing licenses and permit the licensed captain to go from boat to boat to do business. Florida also requires
us to hold a Gulf Reef Fish Charter/Endorsement. State licenses are issued by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (“FWC”).
Our business is also subject to FWC Florida Charter for Hire Regulations and Florida Recreational Fishing Regulations. We are further
required to register as our boats as commercial vessels with the Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. Our business must also follow
certain local restrictions as to seasons, volume, and fish species subject to catch.
We
are also subject to city and county business license requirements.
Any
failure to comply with the rules and regulations that govern fishing charter businesses could result in substantial penalties. Since
such rules and regulations are frequently amended or interpreted differently by regulatory agencies, we are unable to accurately predict
the future cost or impact on our business in complying with such laws or ultimately what cost or impact compliance or otherwise will
have on us. Nevertheless, we do believe that our business is currently in regulatory compliance with those rules and regulations incumbent
upon us.
Environment
We
seek to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local statutory laws or regulations concerning the preservation of our environment.
The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (“MSA”) is the primary federal law governing marine fisheries
management in federal waters up to two hundred nautical miles off the U.S. coasts. The MSA works through local councils to maintain its
objectives. Our business falls under the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, one of eight councils that are responsible for developing
management plans to prevent overfishing, rebuild fish stocks and promote the long-term health of fishing. MSA councils look to the Scientific
and Statistical Committee (“SSC”) for advice over a range management issues, such as what is an acceptable biological catch,
maximum sustainability, and rebuilding targets. Based on data generated by the SSC, each council develops a fish management plan and
submits recommended regulations to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management will also work with the FWC
to ensure consistency in catch limitations. NOAA is one of the agencies responsible the enforcement of MSA directives.
Florida
is fiercely protective of its fish stocks given the tremendous economic impact it has on the state. On the state level the FWC is responsible
for saltwater regulations that extend up to nine nautical miles off the Florida Gulf Coast. Regulations published through the FWC go
to bag limits, species, size, and season for each fish species that can be legally caught. The FWC also publishes a list of fish species
that cannot be caught. Since restrictions are subject to change, current restrictions are published online on the FWC’s website,
eRegulations.com, and through independent businesses that offer fishing charters. Local fishing areas may also maintain restrictions
on fishing that apply to their communities.
Expenditures
for compliance with federal state and local environmental laws have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on our business.

1C. CYBERSECURITY
Limited
Risk Management Strategy for Handling Sensitive Data
Risk
Management and Strategy
Arvana
is committed to the integrity and security of the sensitive data that it collects, maintains, and transmits across its computer systems.
Over the ordinary course of our business, Arvana and its third-party service providers, such as charter booking services, collect, maintain,
and transmit sensitive data including proprietary or confidential business information (such as operational data and personal information).
The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation.
Despite
our efforts to implement robust security measures, in reliance on administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, our risk management
strategies, and practices for protecting sensitive data are subject to certain limitations. A variety of factors give rise to these limitations
including the evolving nature of cyber threats, resource constraints, and the inherent risks associated with the technologies we and
third-party service providers employ. Arvana relies on third parties, including cloud vendors and consultants, for various business functions.
Many of our third-party service providers have access to our information systems and data, and we rely on such third parties for the
operation of our business. We oversee third-party service providers by conducting vendor diligence. Vendors are generally assessed for
risk based on the nature of their service, access to data and systems and supply chain risk.
7
Arvana’s
current risk management strategy may not fully account for or mitigate the risks posed by emerging technologies or the potential impact
of these limitations on our business. Financial liabilities, damage to our reputation, and erosion of customer trust could negatively
affect our business operations and financial condition.
We
have adopted a cybersecurity governance structure to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats that include
a framework to respond to and assess internal and external threats to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Arvana’s
data and information systems. Under which framework management is responsible for assessing and managing material risks that arise from
cybersecurity threats. We have not engaged third-party qualified contractors or claim any management expertise from which to draw in
the event of cybersecurity threats.
Governance
When
identified by management, cybersecurity threats are to be immediately reported to Arvana’s Audit Committee. The Audit Committee
has primary responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity threats once a cybersecurity threat has been reported to it by management.
Matters to be considered by the Audit Committee include management risks relating to data privacy, technology, and information security.
The Audit Committee must also consider Arvana’s cyber security measures and the back-up of information systems, along with what
steps Arvana has taken to monitor and control cybersecurity exposure. Further, the Audit Committee is tasked with the responsibility
for conferring with management and Arvana’s auditors as to the adequacy and effectiveness of information safeguards, cybersecurity
policies, and internal controls that impact information security. The Audit Committee will be briefed on any material cybersecurity incidents
that might adversely affect our business at least once each year, such brief will include topics such as risk assessment, risk management,
control decisions, service provider arrangements, security incidents, responses with recommendations for changes or updates to policies
and procedures.
While
Arvana has not experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, it cannot guarantee that our cybersecurity safeguards will prevent breaches
or breakdowns of our third-party service providers’ information technology systems, particularly in the face of continually evolving
cybersecurity threats and increasingly sophisticated threat actors.
A
cybersecurity incident could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation, in addition
to potentially subjecting us to government investigations, litigation, fines or damages.

This
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other parts of this annual report
contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such
as “anticipates,” “expects,” “believes,” “plans,” “predicts,” and similar
terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results
discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include but are not limited to those discussed
in the subsection entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition below.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included in this report. Our fiscal
year end is December 31.
Discussion
and Analysis
Overview
Arvana
acquired Down2Fish on February 3, 2023 as a wholly owned subsidiary. Down2Fish operates a Florida based fishing charter business offering
a range of curated maritime adventures including inshore, offshore, and custom charters for fishing enthusiasts, nature lovers and tourists.
The business is operated from a private dock in Palmetto, Florida that services the Tampa Bay area in addition to St Petersburg, Sarasota,
Venice, Port Charlotte, and Clearwater. Down2Fish generates its revenue from the sale and provision of fishing charter services.
12
Plan
of Operation
Our
plan of operation is to support the development of our business, and to build on its existing business model. We believe that an expansion
of marketing efforts around Tampa Bay, to offer a wider range of services, such as dolphin tours, will help establish the Down2Fish brand,
attract more customers and increase revenues. Expansion into new service offerings will however require capital sufficient to finance
the purchase of another vessel and additional boating equipment. We believe that dolphin tours can return net revenue on a consistent
basis if we are able to attract sufficient customers to each excursion. We are currently licensed and equipped to carry no more than
six (6) customers on each fishing charter. A vessel designed primarily for dolphin tours can carry from fifty (50) to one hundred (100)
customers. Our primary impediment for equipment procurement and installation is cost. We are presently considering financing options
that might become available to us in the near term but have no assurance that financing options will become available or that if such
did become available, that the financing terms would be tenable for our business. Unless or until we can offer excursions that cater
to a greater number of customers on each excursion, we will continue to focus on offering more fishing charter excursions to build revenue
and improve our results of operations.
While
Arvana operates its fishing charter business it has continued to seek business opportunities in real estate development. On December
12, 2023 Arvana announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding to acquire the business of FirstShot Centers, LLC, a Nevada based
company intent on expanding its specialty use concept to acquire and repurpose vacant shopping malls, outlet locations, and big bog stores
throughout the United States to attract new tenants from targeted industries that offer goods or services that are not available online.
The parties have ended their discussions of the proposed transaction, and management is evaluating alternative options for pursuing this
business model.
Results
of Operations
During
the year ended December 31, 2023 Arvana purchased Down2Fish as a wholly owned subsidiary, raised capital to sustain operations, evaluated
other business opportunities, and offered charter fishing services.
Charter
fishing services were curtailed in the third quarter of 2023 and halted in the fourth quarter of 2023, due to necessary repairs to both
of our vessels under their respective warranties.
Our
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 were as follows below:

Revenue
Charter
revenue from operations was $67,964 for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $68,276 for the twelve-month period ended December
31, 2023, a decrease of 0.5%. The decrease in revenue in the current year is attributed to complications arising due to the hurricanes
occurring in the second half of 2024. Revenue results for the current year were hampered by necessary repairs to both of our fishing
charter vessels.
We
expect charter revenue from operations to increase over the next twelve months as both of our fishing charter vessels return to active
service.
Operating
Expenses
Operating
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased to $406,236 as compared to $528,513 for the twelve-month period ended December
31, 2023, a decrease of 23.1%.  The decrease in operating expenses over the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2024 is attributed
to reductions in auditing expenses as well as general and administrative expenses including stock-based compensation.
We
expect operating expenses to increase in future periods as our business development strategies are implemented while professional fees
for auditing and accounting are expected to increase over the next twelve months.
Other
Income and Expenses
Other
expense for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2024 was $74,903 as compared to other expense of $829,651 for the twelve-month
period ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 91.0%  . The reduction in other expense over the comparative periods can be primarily
attributed to the loss recognized in 2023 on the acquisition of Down2Fish.
We
expect other expense to decrease over future periods as debt instruments tied to the fishing charter vessels are satisfied.
Net
Loss
Net
loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $447,495 as compared to a net loss of $1,316,573 for the year ended December 31, 2023,
a decrease of 66.0%.   The decrease in net loss in the current year over the prior comparable period can be primarily attributed
to the loss recognized on the asset purchase of Down2Fish. We expect to continue to realize net losses from operations over the next
twelve months as management works to implement its business model.
Capital
Expenditures
Capital
expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted of $25,000 for website development costs. Capital expenditures during
the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of the property and equipment acquired as part of Down2Fish.
14
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Since
inception, Arvana has experienced significant changes in liquidity, capital resources, and stockholders’ deficit.
We
had current assets of $18,393  as of December 31, 2024 consisting solely of cash as compared to $27,171 as of December 31, 2023
consisting of cash and a bond. Total assets were $202,176  as of December 31, 2024 consisting of current assets, property, equipment,
and intangible assets as compared to total assets of $216,549 as of December 31, 2023 consisting of cash, a bond, property, equipment,
and intangible assets. We had a working capital deficit of $969,980  as of December 31, 2024 compared to a working capital deficit
of $311,316 as of December 31, 2023. Net stockholders' deficit in Arvana was $1,250,966  at December 31, 2024 compared to a net
stockholders' deficit in Arvana of $962,126 at December 31, 2023.

Net
cash used operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $193,580 as compared to net cash used in operating activities
of $168,018 for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities in the current period can be attributed to book
expense items that do not affect the total amount relative to actual cash used, such as stock-based compensation, depreciation, and loss
on asset purchase. Balance sheet accounts that affect cash but are not income statement related that are added or deducted to arrive
at cash used in operating activities include accounts payable and amounts due to related parties.
We
expect net cash used in operating activities to continue over the next twelve months as we implement our business plan.
Cash
Used in Investing Activities
Net
cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $25,000 as compared to $54,552 net cash used in investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities in the prior year can be attributed to asset acquisition
and the purchase of fixed assets offset by amounts received from the sale of fixed assets.
We
expect to use net cash in investing activities in the near term as investment will be required of us in connection with the expansion
our fishing charter business.
15
Cash
Flows from Financing Activities
Net
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $214,802 as compared to net cash provided by financing
activities of $102,276 for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net cash provided from financing activities in the current year consisted
of proceeds from loans payable to related parties offset by payments made on loans payable to related parties.
We
expect to continue to use net cash provided by financing activities over the next twelve months generated through additional private
equity placements, public offerings, or private debt to expand our business.

does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Critical
Accounting Policies
The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the
reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. We continually review the estimates
and underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances. Accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently
uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.
A
summary of our critical accounting policies is provided in Note 1 to the audited financial statements for the years ended December 31,
2024 and 2023 included in this Form 10-K. We discuss accounting policies that are significant in determining our results of operations.

Sheet Arrangements
We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also
known as “special purpose entities.”

To
the Shareholders, Board of Directors & Shareholders
Arvana
Inc.
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Arvana Inc. as of December 31, 2024 and the related statements of operations,
changes in stockholders’ deficit, cash flows, and the related notes (collectively referred to as “financial statements”)
for the year then ended. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of December 31, 2024 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year December 31, 2024 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going
Concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #2 to
the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations and it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note
#2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To
the Stockholders’ of Arvana Inc.
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Arvana Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated
notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for year ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Explanatory
Paragraph – Going Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses, has incurred negative cash flows
from operations and has an accumulated deficit. For the year ended December 31, 2023 the Company had an operating loss of $530,922, net
cash $206,118 and working capital deficit of $311,316. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan regarding these matters is also described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These

we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion

Arvana
Inc.
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements
For
the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
Note
1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization
Arvana
Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 16, 1977, as Turinco, Inc. On July 24, 2006, the Company
changed its name to Arvana Inc. to reflect the acquisition of a telecommunications business. The Company discontinued its telecommunications
operations as of December 31, 2009.
On
February 3, 2023, the Company acquired Down 2 Fish Charters, LLC, which was organized in the State of Florida on April 1, 2019. Down2Fish
operates a Florida based fishing charter business offering a range of curated maritime adventures including inshore, offshore, and custom
charters for fishing enthusiasts, nature lovers, and tourists. The business is operated from a private dock in Palmetto, Florida that
services the Tampa Bay area in addition to St Petersburg, Sarasota, Venice, Port Charlotte, and Clearwater. Down2Fish generates its revenue
from the sale and provision of fishing charter services as well as the lease of Down2Fish’s marine equipment.
Basis
of Presentation
The
Company’s fiscal year end is December 31. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended
December 31, 2024, and 2023 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US
GAAP”) for financial information with the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-K. Results are not necessarily indicative
of results which may be achieved in future periods.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited
consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. These estimates include the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and the evaluation of unrecognized
deductible temporary tax differences.
Financial
Instruments
The
Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash, a government-issued bond, accounts payable, notes payable to related
parties, other amounts due to related parties, and notes payable to financial institutions. The carrying amounts of cash, the government-issued
bond, accounts payable, and other amounts due to related parties approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities.
Notes
payable to related parties and financial institutions consist of both short-term and long-term borrowings. The fair value of these notes
payable approximates their carrying amounts because the interest rates approximate current market rates or because these instruments
are carried at amounts reflecting current borrowing terms.
23
Concentration
of Credit Risk
The
Company maintains cash deposits at financial institutions in accounts that may at times exceed federally insured limits. At December
31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have any cash balances in excess of insured FDIC limits. The Company has not experienced any losses
on such accounts, and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risks.
Income
Taxes
A
deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss
carry-forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect
during the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Stock
Split
On
February 21, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved a 3-for-1 forward stock split of the common shares. The stock split was
filed with the Nevada Secretary of State effective March 31, 2023, and was reflected in the market through the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (FINRA) on April 19, 2023. All references in these financial statements to common stock, share counts, and per-share amounts
have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for all share-based payments to employees and non-employees under ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which
requires that the value of the award be established at the date of grant and then expensed over the vesting period of the grant. The
method of determining the fair value of share-based payments depends on the type of award. Stock-based compensation expense is included
in general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations.
For
share-based awards which are fully vested and non-forfeitable at the grant date, the cost is measured and recognized at that date.
For
share-based awards vesting over a certain service period with no market conditions, the cost is valued using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model based on inputs determined for the grant date. Once the per-share fair value on the grant date is established, the award
is expensed over a weighted-average service period for the entire award using the straight-line method (also referred to as the single-award
method).
In
accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, the Company has elected to account for forfeitures of options when such forfeitures occur
rather than estimating forfeitures at the grant date. Therefore, the Company records stock-based compensation expense assuming all option
holders will complete the requisite service period for the options to fully vest, and then an adjustment is recorded in the period during
which forfeitures occur. Compensation cost is not reversed for stock options that have vested prior to forfeiture.
Earnings
(Loss) Per Share
Basic
earnings (loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings
(loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, including
stock options and warrants. The Company had 6,150,000
outstanding stock options at December 31, 2024 and 7,950,000
at December 31, 2023, which have been excluded from the calculation
of diluted loss per share because their effects would be anti-dilutive due to net losses in both periods.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted by the Company
In
June 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments. ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about expected credit
losses on financial instruments and other commitments and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information
to inform credit loss estimates. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2023, which adoption has not had a material effect
on its financial statements.
Reclassifications
The Company made the following reclassifications for the year ended December 31, 2023 to conform with the current year presentation on the statement of operations:
•Lease
Revenue: $44,000
was reclassified
from other income and expenses to revenue.
•Cost
of Services: $26,685
was reclassified from charter expenses, as previously included in operating expenses, to cost of services for inclusion in gross profit
•Depreciation
Expense: $23,969
was reclassified from charter expenses, as previously included in operating expenses, to a separate line item under operating expenses for enhanced transparency.
These reclassifications reflect a change in financial statement presentation as a result of changes in operational strategies due to new management in 2024, and were done solely to enhance comparability to the current year.
These reclassifications are not corrections of errors, and they had no impact on net loss, total assets, or total liabilities for the period presented.
To conform with the current year presentation on the statement of cash flows, the Company reclassified $38,100
related to the change in related-party payables from financing activities to operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023.
This reclassification had no impact on the net change in cash or the ending balance of cash and cash equivalents for the period presented.
Note
2 – Going Concern
The
Company incurred net losses of $447,495
and $1,316,573
for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company
had a working capital deficit of $988,373 and
an accumulated deficit of $38,027,451
as of December 31, 2024. The Company has incurred significant
losses since inception and will require additional funding from external sources to further implement its business development strategy.
Currently, the Company has no firm commitments for such funding. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability or classification of recorded assets or liabilities
that may result from this uncertainty in the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

Note
3 – Asset Acquisition
On
February 3, 2023 (Closing Date), the company acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of Down 2 Fish Charters, LLC (D2F), a limited
liability company organized under the laws of Florida, which operates a charter fishing business. On the Closing Date, the Company paid
$50,000
in cash and issued a note for $700,000
for total consideration of $750,000.
The Company’s consolidated statements of operations from the Closing Date through December 31, 2023 indicate a net loss of $1,316,573.
Assets
acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the Closing Date under the acquisition method of
accounting. The estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities including long-lived assets require judgment and assumptions.
Adjustments may be made to these estimates during the measurement period and those adjustments could be material.
Assets
acquired and liabilities assumed are based on their fair values as of the Closing Date, with the excess of cost over fair value of $771,009.
For the period ended December 31, 2023 the Company recorded an impairment loss of $771,009
on the excess amount. Assets acquired are as follows:

The
Company did not incur any acquisition related costs during the period. Property and equipment acquired consisted primarily of offshore
support vessels. The Company recorded property and equipment acquired at an estimated fair value of $178,706.
The fair values of the offshore support vessels were estimated by applying a replacement cost approach. These assets will be tested for
impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. The Company estimates the remaining useful lives for the vessels acquired are seven
years, based on an original estimated useful life of ten years. The charter fishing license acquired is a perpetual federal fishing license,
which grants the Company access to fish in federally regulated waters off the coast of Florida. This asset is not amortized and is tested
for impairment at least annually.

Note
5 – Intangible Assets
The
Company acquired a perpetual federal fishing license as part of the acquisition of Down2Fish’s assets (see Note 3 for more information),
which grants the Company access to fish in federally regulated waters off the coast of Florida. This asset is not amortized and is tested
for impairment at least annually. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company determined no impairment of this asset had occurred.
The
Company maintains a website and capitalizes website development costs under ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs. In December 2023,
the Company capitalized $10,000 of
website development costs and then wrote off the capitalized asset as a $10,000
impairment loss in December 2023 because the website was discontinued
and replaced with a new website placed in service in April 2024. The impairment loss was included in general and administrative expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2023. In April 2024, the Company capitalized $25,000
of website development costs, which is amortized on a straight-line
basis over its estimated useful life of five years.
Note
6 – Leases (Company as Lessor)
The
Company leases marine equipment to a related party in an operating lease arrangement. The lease commenced on January 1, 2023 and ends
December 31, 2025. The agreement provides for fixed minimum monthly lease payments of $4,000
for the term of the agreement. At the end of the term any additional
lease payment due will be calculated and paid. The lessee’s right to use the marine equipment is limited to periods when the equipment
is not in use by the Company. There is no option to purchase the equipment as part of the agreement, and the Company expects to recoup
the full value of the equipment upon its eventual sale. The Company manages risk by requiring the lessee to indemnify the Company in
the event of loss to property or persons.
Lease
income was $48,000 and
$44,000 for
the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Lease income is included in revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Future
lease payments expected to be received under this related-party lease are as follows:

8 – Related-Party Transactions and Notes Payable to Stockholders
Effective
September 1, 2022, the Company signed an employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer at the time for $90,000
per year plus incentive stock options until year-end December
31, 2022, and thereafter for $120,000
per year over the term. In July, 2024 the Board of Directors
terminated the CEO’s employment for cause and then appointed a new CEO on July 17, 2024. The new CEO’s compensation is $60,000
per year beginning in July of 2024. At September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, accrued payroll of $0
and $30,000
is included in related-party payables.
During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued 600,000
shares of common stock at a price of $0.067
with a fair value of $40,000
to settle $40,000
in accounts payable owed to a company controlled by the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer at the time. No gain or loss was recognized on the settlement, and no share-issuance costs were incurred.
At
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company included $1,400
and $1,200
in related-party payables for accrued fees owed to board members
for services rendered.
At
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company owed $0
and $15,000
to a company controlled by a related party for website creation,
website development, and web hosting services. These amounts are included in related-party payables.
During
the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation of $158,655
and $249,952
for the grant of stock options to its Chief Executive Officer,
board members, and other parties. See Note 10 for more information.
During
the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has repaid non-interest-bearing notes payable to related parties totaling $132,000
and $0
which were due at various dates between May 30, 2024 and January
15, 2025.
The
Company has an interest-bearing note payable to a related party for $300,000
with an original due date of February 22, 2025 which has been
extended, by mutual agreement, to January 31, 2026.
The
Company has a non-interest-bearing note payable to a related party for $50,000
with an original due date of April 23, 2025 which has been
extended, by mutual agreement, to January 31, 2026.
On
April 4, 2024, the Company paid the annual interest payment due to the seller of Down2Fish in connection with the note payable related
to the purchase of Down2Fish.
Subsequent
to the end of the reporting period, the Company executed a series of amendments to promissory notes with various parties to modify
the terms of the notes including extensions of their respective maturity dates (see Note 7 for more information). The terms of the
amended agreement for one promissory note related to the purchase of Down2Fish, with a principal amount of $700,000,
resulted in the issuance of 500,000 restricted
shares of common stock to the seller of Down2Fish to hold as additional collateral for the fulfillment of the note. As a result of
the share issuance, the seller became a related party to the Company, and certain other parties became related parties due to
ownership attribution. The restated financial statements have been updated to reflect the reclassification of the relevant
promissory notes from long-term notes payable to related-party notes payable, and corresponding adjustments were also made to the
current portion of long-term notes payable and current portion of related-party notes payable to reflect the amended terms of the
notes.

Note
9 – Common Stock
The
Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000
shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2024, a total of
107,845,554 shares
were issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2023, 107,845,554
shares were issued, of which 107,839,299
shares were outstanding and 6,255
shares were classified as treasury stock.
During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued 4,800,000
shares of its restricted common stock at a price of $0.067
per share for total gross proceeds of $320,000.
The Company incurred $32,237
in share issuance costs related to this transaction.
During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued 600,000
shares of common stock at a price of $0.067
with a fair value of $40,000
to settle accounts payable of $40,000
owed to a company controlled by the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer at the time. No gain or loss was recognized on the settlement, and no
share-issuance costs were incurred.
On
April 19, 2023, the Company effected a 3-for-1 forward stock split for shareholders of record as of March 31, 2023. All share and per-share
data have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split in all periods presented.
During
the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company issued 12,500,000 shares of restricted common stock at an approximate price of $0.008
per share as part of executing a consulting services agreement with its majority stockholder. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
awards in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, which requires that the cost of all equity-based compensation be reflected in the
financial statements over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value of the awards. Before December 31, 2024, the Board of
Directors exercised the claw-back provision included in the consulting services agreement for all 12,500,000 shares. Due to the exercise
of the claw-back provision, the stock-based compensation expense associated with this award was fully reversed and no net expense was
recorded for any period.
The
Company conducted an examination of its stock records and determined 6,255 shares previously reported as treasury stock were no longer
held by the Company as of January 1, 2024. The Company concluded the shares were reissued in a prior period, and the impact is immaterial.
The Company removed the 6,255 shares from treasury stock and made a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital on January
1, 2024. The impact of this adjustment is immaterial, and it did not affect net loss or cash flows in any period presented.
No
other shares of common stock were issued during the years ended
December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Note
10 – Stock Options
The
Company adopted the 2022 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) effective September 30, 2022. The Plan provides for awards of
stock options and restricted stock to officers, directors, key employees, and consultants. Under the Plan option prices are set by the
Compensation Committee and may not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the grant date. The Company accounts for stock-based
compensation awards in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which addresses the accounting
for employee stock options and requires that the cost of all employee stock options, as well as other equity-based compensation arrangements,
be reflected in the financial statements over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value of the awards.
30
At
December 31, 2024 the Company had 6,150,000
options outstanding and at December 31, 2023 the Company had
7,950,000
options outstanding with vesting periods ranging from 2
to 5
years and exercise prices of approximately $0.087
per share. During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
a total of 1,800,000
options—consisting of 810,000
vested options and 990,000
unvested options—were forfeited by the former Chief Executive
Officer and a former member of the board. In addition, the Board of Directors approved a resolution to modify the terms of the options
granted to the former Chief Executive Officer to cancel any vested options not exercised within 30 days of termination for cause. The
Company accounts for forfeitures when they occur; accordingly, a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of $59,602
was recorded in the three months ending September
30, 2024.
Subsequent to the end of the reporting period, the Company conducted an examination of its accounting policies for stock-based
compensation and determined certain awards were not properly expensed in prior periods due to the application of incorrect vesting periods
and other computational errors. As a result, the cumulative stock-based compensation expense was understated by $23,015.
In accordance with ASC 250-10-45-23, the Company has corrected this error by recording an adjustment to retained earnings as of January
1, 2024.
Total
stock-based compensation was $158,655
and $249,952
for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company
will recognize the remaining $152,844 as follows:

11 – Subsequent Events
The
Company evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were issued.
On
May 20, 2025, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Andrew Morrison as a member of the board and as the Company’s Chief
Financial Officer and Treasurer. This appointment was made in connection with a review of certain previously issued financial statements,
including an evaluation of the appropriateness of specific accounting policies and related disclosures. As a result of this evaluation,
the Company has issued restated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the three and six months ended June 30,
2024, and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 12 for more information.
Subsequent to the end of the reporting period, the Company executed a series of amendments to promissory notes with various parties
to modify the terms of the notes including extensions of their respective maturity dates. See Note 7 for more information on the amended
maturity dates and Note 8 for more information on the impact of these modifications resulting in the issuance of stock and changes to
the treatment of related-party notes payable.
Note
12 – Restatement of Previously Issued Interim Financial Statements (Unaudited)
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company identified and corrected errors in its previously issued unaudited condensed financial
statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024. These corrections were reflected in the Company’s
amended Forms 10-Q for the applicable periods, each of which was filed prior to the issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The
errors primarily related to the capitalization of website development costs, accrual of professional fees, and accounting for stock-based
compensation expense including the forfeiture of unvested stock options. The Company evaluated the materiality of the errors in accordance
with the guidance in ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, and determined that the errors were material to the previously
issued interim financial statements. Accordingly, the Company restated its financial statements for the affected periods.
The
corrections did not impact the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. For a detailed discussion
of the restatements, refer to the amended Forms 10-Q for the applicable periods as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
Arvana
previously reported a change in its independent registered public accounting firm in a Form 8-K report pursuant to §13 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act on October 6, 2024.
ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
In
connection with the preparation of this annual report, an evaluation was carried out by management, with the participation of our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of Arvana’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of December31, 2024.
Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Based
on that evaluation, management concluded that Arvana’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31,
2024 in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in
the Commission’s rules and forms, due to material weaknesses in internal controls related to the application of certain accounting
policies, including the capitalization of website development costs, accrual of professional fees, and accounting for stock-based compensation.
To
support the implementation of remedial actions and strengthen the Company’s financial reporting process, the Board of Directors
appointed Andrew E. Morrison as the new Chief Financial Officer on May 20, 2025.
Management's
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We
maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP). Management has assessed the effectiveness of these internal controls as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this
report based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control –Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission.
Based
on this assessment, our chief executive officer identified the following material weakness in connection with his review of our financial
statements as of December 31, 2024.
As
of December 31, 2024 Arvana relied on one individual who had sole responsibility for the preparation of financial reporting disclosure
in his capacity as chief executive officer and acting chief financial officer. The Company’s inaction to bifurcate the duties of
each office is a material weakness that could impact financial reporting. Management has concluded, in light of this material weakness,
that internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report. Management
believes this material weakness affected our financial results in prior reporting periods, believes this weakness could result in a material
misstatement of our financial statements in future periods that might not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. As a result, the
Board of Directors appointed Andrew E. Morrison as the new Chief Financial Officer on May 20, 2025 to assist the chief executive officer
in implementing the rest of Arvana’s remediation plans to address the weaknesses identified in the Company’s system of internal
controls over financial reporting.
32
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during
the three months ended December 31, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.
However,
as disclosed above, subsequent to the end of the reporting period, the Company began implementing remedial measures to address the identified
control deficiencies. These measures include:
•Hiring
a new Chief Financial Officer to oversee the implementation of remedial actions;
•Enhancing
internal review and approval processes for accounting estimates and journal entries;
•Improving
documentation and evaluation of complex or judgmental accounting matters;
•Increasing
oversight over third-party service providers involved in financial reporting; and
•Hiring
additional accounting personnel to perform various accounting functions in order to achieve
a proper segregation of duties and so that the new Chief Financial Officer can properly perform
his oversight functions.
Management
will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these remediation efforts and will make further changes as necessary to ensure internal
control over financial reporting is effective in future periods.
Attestation
Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm
Our
annual report does not include an attestation report of Arvana’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. We were not required to have, nor have we, engaged our independent registered public accounting firm

Insider
Trading Policies and Procedures
As
of the date of this filing, the Company has not adopted a formal insider trading policy or procedure applicable to directors, officers,
employees, or the Company itself. The Company is a smaller reporting company with a limited number of employees and officers, and management
believes that it can adequately monitor trading activity and compliance with applicable securities laws without a formal written policy.
While the Company does not currently maintain a formal policy, all directors, officers, and employees are expected to comply with the
requirements of federal securities laws, including restrictions on trading while in possession of material non-public information. The
Company continues to evaluate its governance practices and may adopt a formal insider trading policy in the future as its operations
grow or its circumstances change.
34
Corporate
Social Responsibility
We
believe that social responsibility is essential for a healthy and equitable corporate culture; one that balances the interests of its
various worldwide stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, and our potential partners and customers. We are committed to sound
corporate citizenship in the way we manage our people, our business and our impact on society and the environment. Furthermore, we acknowledge
our responsibility to ensure our products will be designed, developed, and supplied in an environmentally safe and sound manner. We believe
that we obey and comply with all laws and regulations that apply to us in the communities where we do business. Further, we value our
stockholders’ governance view and will solicit feedback from our stockholders relating to matters that are important to them, on
environmental, social and governance topics.

the best of our knowledge, none of the following events occurred during the past ten years that are material to an evaluation of the

the Commodity Exchange Act (7U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary
authority over its members or persons associated with a member.
Director
Independence and Board Committees
We
are not required under the Exchange Act to maintain any committees of our Board. Further, we are not currently subject to listing requirements
of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which have requirements that a majority of the board of directors
be “independent” or maintain any committees of our Board and, as a result, we are not at this time required to have our Board
comprised of a majority of “independent directors” or to have any committees. However, we do have two independent directors
on our Board around which we formed a compensation committee to administer the 2022 Arvana Stock Incentive Plan and an audit committee.
Meetings
of the Board
During
its fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 the Board met on four occasions by telephonic means, and otherwise transacted Arvana’s
business by unanimous written consent.
Family
Relationships
There
are no family relationships by between or among the members of the Board or other executive officers of Arvana.
Indemnification
Our
articles of incorporation and bylaws include provisions limiting the liability of directors and officers and indemnifying them under
certain circumstances. We further intend to secure directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in the near term. Insofar
as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”) may be permitted
to directors, officers or persons controlling Arvana pursuant to Nevada law, we are informed that in the opinion of the Commission, such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.
36
Audit
Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert
The
Board has established an audit committee that is comprised of James Kim, Andrew E. Morrison, and Sir John Baring. Mr. Morrison, a Certified
Public Accountant with 20 years of experience in public accounting, has been designated by the Board as the “audit committee financial
expert” as defined by Item 407(d)(6)(ii) of Regulation S-K. While the Board benefits from Mr. Morrison’s expertise, it also
regularly engages qualified CPAs to advise on financial reporting matters, potential issues, and the evaluation of the Company’s
financial statements. The Board is actively seeking to expand its membership and add an additional director with strong financial expertise.
The
audit committee recommends independent accountants to audit its financial statements, discusses the scope and results of the audit with
our independent accountants, considers the adequacy of internal accounting controls, considers audit procedures and reviews non-audit
services performed by our independent accountants.
The
audit committee would also be called upon to oversee our cybersecurity framework in the event management identifies a cybersecurity threat.
Code
of Ethics
We
have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to our directors, officers, and employees.
A
copy of our Code of Ethics is incorporated by reference, to the Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2006, filed as an exhibit
thereto on April16, 2007.
Significant
Employees
Our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer are Arvana’s only significant employees.
Term
of Office
Our
directors are appointed for one (1) year terms to hold office until the next annual stockholders meeting or until removed from the Board
in accordance with Arvana’s bylaws.
Arvana’s
chief executive officer and chief financial officer retain their positions in accordance with their respective consulting agreements,
subject to removal by the Board, or their resignation.
Board
Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight
Our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer also serve as members of the Board. These two individuals are currently responsible
for all oversight aspects of finance and accounting functions. Due to reliance on two individuals to fill multiple roles within the Company,
we do not have a formal policy regarding the separation of duties related to accounting and finance functions. We are working on bifurcating
the responsibilities of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer to help remediate this internal control weakness, and
management is actively working on hiring additional personnel to perform various functions related to finance and accounting in order
to achieve a proper segregation of duties and establish oversight functions.
The
Board has determined that the present leadership structure is appropriate for Arvana and its stockholders at this stage of the Company’s
development and while it continues to implement its business strategies. This structure promotes alignment between the Board and management
and establishes a unified chain of command to support execution of strategic initiatives. The Board also believes that including the
chief executive officer and chief financial officer as directors strengthens the connection between management and the Board to facilitate
the regular and effective flow of information.
37
Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports
Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our
equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, directors
and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by Commission regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
they file. Based on our review of the copies of such forms received by us, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31,
2023, all such applicable filing requirements were met.
ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation
Discussion and Analysis
The
objective of our compensation program is to incentivize management for services rendered and to reward management on fulfilling corporate
objectives.
Arvana
entered into a consulting agreement with its sole executive officer effective July 17, 2024, and he is compensated based on amounts invoiced
as a related party for services rendered. The Board determined to transition from “shell” status in 2022, and Arvana exited
“shell” status in the first quarter of 2023. We believe that our chief executive officer’s consulting agreement is
adequate to compensate him for his service to Arvana, and is in line with compensatory packages typical of other smaller reporting companies.
The Board also believes that our chief financial officer’s consulting agreement is adequate at this time to compensation him for
his services to Arvana.
Executive
compensation paid or accrued to our prior chief executive officer for the periods ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $70,000
and $120,000 (including option awards), respectively. Executive compensation for our current chief executive officer for the year ended
December 31, 2024 was $30,000.
During
the year ended December 31, 2024 the Company incurred director’s fees of $800 (2023 - $1,600).
The
information provided below with respect to “named executive officers,” as defined by Commission regulations, includes compensation
paid or accrued to our sole executive officer during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Arvana had no other executive
officers, or non-executive officers or employees whose total compensation during the respective fiscal years presented exceeded $100,000.
During
the year ended December 31, 2024 Arvana paid $70,000 in wages to our former CEO and $120,000 in wages during the year ended December
31, 2023.
Long-Term
Incentive Plans
Arvana
does not have any long-term incentive plans, pension plans, or similar compensatory plans with its directors or named executive officer
as of December 31, 2024.
38
Outstanding
Equity Awards
As
of December 31, 2024 there were no outstanding equity awards held by our former named chief executive officer. All unexercised options
were forfeited in August, 2024 under the terms of the 2022 stock option plan.
Change
of Control Agreements
Arvana
is not party to any change of control agreements with any of its directors or executive officers.
Employment
Agreement
Service

the date of grant.
39
2022
Stock Incentive Plan

Board approved the Arvana Inc. 2022 Stock Incentive Plan on September 30, 2022, and thereafter granted certain incentive stock options
to our named executive officer, and certain non-qualified stock options to Board members and consultants as of provided in the table

Paid to Directors

compensates its independent directors for service on the Board. For the year ended December 31, 2024 the compensation paid or accrued
for directors consisted of $800 in director’s fees for Sir John Baring and $2,534 in stock-based compensation via options awarded
to Sir John Baring.
Non-qualified
Stock Options
Arvana
granted 150,000 non-qualified options pursuant to the Incentive Plan to each non-executive member of the Board on October 15, 2022, for
services to be rendered, that vest in equal increments over five (5) years. The non-qualified stock options, when vested, have an exercise
price of $0.087 per share for a period of six (6) years from the date of grant.
Pension,

has no current arrangements or plans in which it is obligated to provide pension, retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive
officers.

13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions
None
of our directors or executive officers, nor any proposed nominee for election as a director, nor any person who beneficially owns, directly
or indirectly, shares carrying more than 5% of the voting rights attached to all of our outstanding shares, nor any members of the immediate
family (including spouse, parents, children, siblings, and in−laws) of any of the foregoing persons has any material interest,
direct or indirect, in any transaction since the beginning of our last fiscal year or in any presently proposed transaction which, in
either case, has or will materially affect us except as described below:
•Bondock
LLC – owned by a stockholder, Brian Lovig, holding shares carrying more than 5% of
the voting rights attached to our outstanding shares, accepted two promissory notes from
Arvana in the amount of $350,000 which was assigned in the current fiscal year and outstanding
at December 31, 2024.
Director
Independence
Our
common stock is traded on the OTC Markets Pink Sheets electronic quotation platform, and it is not held to the corporate governance standards
of listed companies. Listed companies require, in addition to other governance criteria, that a majority of a board of directors be independent.
While Arvana is not subject to corporate governance standards relating to the independence of its directors, we define an “independent”
director in accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2)). Arvana has two independent directors on its Board under the NASDAQ Marketplace
Rule.
