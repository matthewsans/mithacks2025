We focus on enabling our customers to overcome technical barriers and improve the performance of their products. We believe our engineering know-how and electronic systems expertise provide meaningful benefits to our customers by enabling them to concentrate on their core competencies of production and marketing.We conduct R&D activities in the United States with additional design and development teams located in various countries that perform specific activities under the direction of our U.S. headquarters.3Table of ContentsCustomersOur customers include many of the world’s largest mobile and PC OEMs, based on unit shipments, as well as many large IoT OEMs, automotive manufacturers and a variety of consumer electronics manufacturers. Our demonstrated track record of technological leadership, design innovation, product performance, cost-effectiveness and on-time deliveries has contributed to our position as a go-to supplier of human experience semiconductor product solutions. We believe our strong relationship with our OEM customers, many of which are also currently developing product solutions, aligned with our target markets, will continue to position us as a preferred partner.We generally supply our products to OEMs through their contract manufacturers, supply chain partners or distributors. We consider both the OEMs and their contract manufacturers or supply chain partners to be our customers, as well as in some cases, our distributors. Both the OEMs and their partners may determine the design and pricing requirements and make the overall decision regarding the use of our semiconductor product solutions in their products. The contract manufacturers and distributors place product purchase orders with us, take title to the products upon delivery and pay us directly for those purchases. The majority of these customers do not have return rights except under applicable warranty provisions.Sales and MarketingWe sell our product solutions for incorporation into the products of our OEM customers. We generate sales through direct sales employees as well as outside sales representatives, distributors and value-added resellers. Our sales personnel receive substantial technical assistance and support from our internal technical marketing and engineering resources due to the highly technical nature of our product solutions. Sales frequently result from multi-level engagement that involve our senior management, design engineers and sales personnel interacting with our customers’ decision makers throughout the product development and order process.See “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 18. Segment and Other Information” for additional information on revenue by geographic location and product category.ManufacturingWe employ a fabless semiconductor manufacturing platform through third-party relationships. We currently utilize third-party semiconductor wafer manufacturers to supply silicon wafers integrating our proprietary design specifications. The completed silicon wafers are forwarded to third-party package and test processors for further processing into die and packaged ASICs, as applicable, which are then used in our custom module products or processed as our ASIC-based solutions.After processing and testing, the die and ASICs are consigned to various contract manufacturers for assembly or shipped directly to our customers. During the assembly process, our die or ASIC is either combined with other components to complete the module for our custom product solutions or the ASIC is maintained as a standalone finished good. The finished assembled product is subsequently shipped directly to our customers or to our contract manufacturers for integration into their products.We believe our third-party manufacturing strategy provides a scalable business model, enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of research and development, technological advances and product design and engineering and reduces our capital investment.Our third-party contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators are predominately Asia-based organizations. We generally provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. As a result of past supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. Our reliance on these parties exposes us to vulnerability owing to our dependence on a few sources of supply. In some cases, we have alternative sources of supply to mitigate supplier risk. We may establish relationships with other contract manufacturers in order to reduce our dependence on any single source of supply.Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In such circumstances, we consider a write-down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. We charge write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving and non-usable inventory to its net realizable value and charge such write-downs to cost of revenue. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue the estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays or order cancellations. In addition, the impact of entering into long-term capacity agreements could create significant inventory write-down if the end customer demand substantially declines.4Table of ContentsCompetitionWe compete against many global and local companies. To win, we focus on delivering exactly what our customers need: top-quality products, advanced technology, strong technical support, flexible global delivery, reliable supply and competitive pricing. Across our product end markets, our principal competitors include:•Processor manufacturers – MPU and MCU makers•Wireless connectivity providers – Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, BLE, Zigbee, Thread, ULE, UWB•Touch sensor and IC manufacturers•Providers of systems on modules and single board computers•Semiconductor and subsystem manufacturers•Embedded computing platforms and systems providersIntellectual Property RightsOur ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies and products.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that materially and adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business operations, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The market price of our securities could decline due to the materialization of these or any other risks, and you could lose part or all of your investment.Risks Related to Our Industry and BusinessWe depend on the IoT, Enterprise and Automotive and Mobile product applications markets for a substantial portion of our revenue. These are cyclical, competitive and evolving markets that are subject to volatility, economic risk and uncertain growth, which may materially affect our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition.We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from our solutions for the Core IoT, Enterprise and Automotive and Mobile markets. These markets are highly competitive and subject to significant volatility, driven by macroeconomic conditions, evolving technical standards, shifting customer preferences, and rapid technological changes. For example, our products are embedded in discretionary consumer and industrial devices such as smartphones, tablets, notebooks, virtual reality systems, and automobiles. As a result, demand in these markets can fluctuate sharply based on factors such as inflation, interest rates, trade restrictions, or recessionary conditions. During periods of slowing growth or heightened uncertainty, customers may cancel, reduce or defer orders, reduce inventory levels, or adjust production forecasts. In addition, these economic conditions could result in higher inventory levels and the possibility of resulting excess capacity charges from our manufacturing partners if we need to slow production to reduce inventory levels. Macroeconomic conditions can also disrupt our supply chain and increase operational costs. If our manufacturing partners, suppliers, distributors and other third-party partners experience financial challenges, they may demand pricing accommodations, delay payment or become insolvent, which could harm our ability to meet our customer demands or collect revenue. Cyclical patterns in our end markets, particularly consumer electronics and automotive, have historically resulted in reduced demand, price erosion, overcapacity and increased inventory. These cycles are difficult to predict and may result in substantial fluctuations in our operating results. Moreover, each market presents unique risks. For example, the automotive industry is especially sensitive to inflation, interest rates and tariffs, all of which may raise vehicle production costs and depress consumer demand. Existing, new or retaliatory tariffs on automobiles and automobile components imported into the United States could disrupt the automotive supply chain and, in turn, adversely affect our growth rate in that industry. Our financial results are also subject to pricing pressure, changes in product mix, and limited ability to control input costs. Average selling prices of our products have historically declined, and we expect this trend to continue. To win business or retain key customers, we may offer price concessions that reduce gross margins. Our more recently introduced products often carry higher development and production costs, and increased sales of lower-margin products in emerging markets may dilute overall profitability. Because we do not operate our own manufacturing, assembly, testing or packaging facilities, we may lack flexibility to scale or reduce costs quickly in response to changing demand. Our reliance on third-party partners also makes us more vulnerable to inflationary input costs, capacity constraints and supply chain disruptions. In addition, deterioration in the financial condition of our contract manufacturers or suppliers could limit our ability to secure components or achieve cost efficiencies.Our future revenue growth also depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and expand our position in these key markets while responding to customer product transitions, emerging competitive solutions, and ongoing technology shifts. If these markets experience slower than expected growth or if demand for our solutions weakens, our revenue and profitability could be materially impacted.Changes to international trade policies, export controls, and foreign operations expose us to legal, regulatory, and operational risks.As a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations governing import, export, and economic sanctions. These restrictions may prohibit sales to certain countries, entities, or individuals, or require export licenses for certain technologies. Many of our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers are foreign companies or have significant foreign operations, and many of the components used in our products are sourced from Asia.9Table of ContentsTariffs on imported components, especially from Asia, could increase our production costs, disrupt supply chains, or make our products and our customers’ end products less competitive in global markets. For example, in the first quarter of calendar 2025, the U.S. government announced new tariffs on imports from several countries, prompting reciprocal tariffs. Tariffs on our customers’ products may reduce their global competitiveness, particularly in China. Some OEMs in our industry have responded with short-term price adjustments and shifted production and sourcing outside of China. Additionally, on August 6, 2025, the U.S. government proposed a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors and chips, with possible exemptions for companies that invest in U.S. manufacturing. While still in the proposal phase, this policy could materially impact our sourcing strategy and component costs, depending on scope and implementation. We rely on global foundry partners, many based in Asia, for a significant portion of our silicon. If adopted, these tariffs could increase our manufacturing costs or require changes to our supply chain operations. We are actively evaluating strategies to mitigate such risks, including potential sourcing diversification or partnerships with U.S.-based manufacturers.Geopolitical instability, including in the Middle East, Taiwan, or U.S.-China relations, could disrupt access to critical markets or destabilize key supply chain and logistics corridors. On June 13, 2025, Israel launched a strike on Iranian military and nuclear sites, followed by Iranian retaliation. On June 21, 2025, the U.S. conducted targeted air strikes, which Iran answered with attacks on U.S. interests. Although a ceasefire has been reached, there is no assurance that hostilities will not escalate or recur. This military escalation between Israel and Iran has increased geopolitical tensions and uncertainty across the broader region. Escalations of hostilities could also trigger new or expanded U.S. sanctions or export controls affecting parties or regions with which we do business. The developments could lead to delayed shipments, increased costs, or reduced revenue in impacted markets.Further escalation in global or U.S.–China trade tensions could weaken China’s economy and reduce demand from customers located in China or selling into that market, which may affect our revenue and operations. Although we have not yet seen widespread tariff-related price increases passed through to us, our customers may respond by requesting pricing accommodations or shifting demand to alternative suppliers. Changes in trade policies or future tariffs could lead to further volatility in customer demand and order behavior. We may also experience fluctuations in order timing as customers adjust their purchases in response to tariffs or logistics concerns, including pulling forward orders into earlier quarters. These shifts may not reflect actual demand and could reduce volumes in future periods.Additionally, our international operations, including in Taiwan, China, South Korea, Hong Kong, and throughout Europe and Asia, expose us to risks such as unexpected regulatory changes, labor law shifts, currency fluctuations, public health emergencies, and environmental compliance burdens.Export control regulations are also evolving. New or expanded restrictions or sanctions—such as those recently imposed by the U.S. on China and Russia—may limit our ability to sell to or source from affected parties. These controls may cover foreign-produced items, advanced technologies, or entities on the U.S. Entity List. If we are unable to serve these customers, they may turn to domestic solutions or competitors not subject to similar restrictions. Such developments may materially impact our revenue and future business opportunities in these regions. Maintaining compliance with global trade and export regulations is increasingly complex, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. Failure to comply could result in fines, reputational harm, or limitations on our ability to operate in key international markets.We face intense competition and our success depends on our ability to deliver innovative, high-performance solutions.We operate in intensely competitive markets characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, and competition from major domestic and international companies. Some of our current and potential competitors may offer bundled solutions; introduce new products with disruptive technologies and AI-enhanced features; or benefit from greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and more extensive resources in sales, R&D, and manufacturing. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to promotion, negotiate lower prices for raw materials and components, deliver products at lower prices, or respond more quickly to customer requirements. To compete effectively, we must win design opportunities with OEM customers, meet their development timelines, and align our solutions with their technical and commercial objectives. One of our core business strategies is to win competitive bid selection processes with OEM customers to design our products into their platforms. These selection processes are often lengthy and require significant design and development investment, with no assurance of winning a contract or generating revenue. Delays in our design cycle, failure to anticipate market needs, or inability to align our products with customer roadmaps may result in missed opportunities. If a customer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that customer. This risk is particularly pronounced in markets such as Automotive, where long design cycles, combined with failure to win a design-in, could lock us out of a customer for several years. If we fail to win key design opportunities, or if we are not perceived as a technology or industry leader, 10Table of Contentsour business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. Also, a design win does not guarantee revenue. Customers may reduce or cease purchases at any time—for example, if their products are not commercially successful. If we fail to convert design wins into sales, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.Even if we secure a design win, our revenue depends on the commercial success of the customer’s product. If that product is delayed, fails to meet expectations, or is discontinued, our sales may not materialize. Additionally, if our interfaces fail to meet customer performance, cost, or integration requirements during development, projects may be canceled altogether. The timing and cost of our development efforts may exceed expectations, especially as we invest significant engineering, testing, and support resources long before volume production begins. We may not recover these costs if the product does not launch or is replaced by an alternative solution.In addition, if we do not keep pace with rapid technological innovation—such as in AI, ML, edge computing and connectivity—our solutions may become less competitive or obsolete. We must invest substantial resources to enhance and develop new technologies, including hiring and retaining skilled engineers, adopting advanced tools and scaling R&D. Even with investment, our technologies may fail to transition from development to cost-effective production or customers may choose competitors’ solutions due to price, performance or strategic alignment. We are also integrating AI and ML technologies into our products, services and internal processes, including in edge computing, voice and vision interfaces and wireless connectivity. The rapid pace of AI and ML innovations may challenge our ability to remain competitive if we fail to keep pace with technological developments or if our competitors more effectively deploy these technologies. While AI and ML offer opportunities to enhance the functionality and efficiency of our product offerings, they also introduce operational, compliance and reputational risks. These include unintended consequences, such as inaccurate or biased outputs, potential misuse by personnel, vulnerabilities in third-party AI tools and heightened scrutiny under evolving laws and regulations governing data privacy, algorithmic transparency and ethical AI use. The use of AI also may expose us to increased intellectual property risks, including claims of infringement, misappropriation or loss of proprietary information.Failure to innovate, keep pace with customer expectations and win key design opportunities, convert such opportunities into sales, offer compelling features at competitive prices, could materially harm our market position and financial performance.Our growth depends on the successful development of emerging markets, including Core IoT, which may be slower, more competitive, or more regulated, which could result in our losing or failing to gain market share and suffering reduced revenue.We face uncertainty in the development and growth of new and emerging markets, such as Core IoT. These markets may develop slower than anticipated or rely on competing technologies that do not include our product solutions. The success of our solutions in these markets depends on several factors, including: the pace of adoption of wireless and other enabling technologies; the emergence and standardization of protocols for device interoperability; the performance, size, power consumption, and cost-effectiveness of our solutions relative to alternatives; and OEM and end-user preferences. Many of these products are still emerging, and demand for them may vary significantly from one period to another. We may face well-established competitors with strong customer relationships, brand recognition, and more extensive resources. If these markets fail to develop as expected, or if our technologies are not widely adopted, our ability to grow revenue, maintain profitability, and increase market share could be significantly impaired. A sustained failure to gain traction in these markets may also require us to restructure certain product or market investments.In addition, unfavorable developments with respect to global laws and regulations—including those affecting artificial intelligence and data governance—could slow or limit adoption of products in these markets, impede our strategic plans, or require changes to our offerings.We also face increased competition as a result of China actively promoting its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment. These actions, as well as China-U.S. trade barriers, may restrict our participation in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies or companies from other countries that China favors over the United States. Competition could decrease our prices, reduce our sales, adversely affect our gross margins and/or decrease our market share.We rely on a concentrated base of OEMs and ODM customers, and the loss of a major customer, or such customer’s failure to renew an existing project or contract, or any changes in their purchasing behavior, or the failure of their products to achieve commercial success, could materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.Our products are not sold directly to end users. Instead, our solutions are integrated into systems sold by OEMs and original design manufacturers (“ODM”), often through contract manufacturers that serve them. A significant portion of our 11Table of Contentsrevenue is generated from a limited number of large customers. This concentration makes us highly dependent on the purchasing behavior of a few OEMs and ODMs and increases our exposure to revenue volatility. If any of these key customers reduce, cancel or stop placing orders, fail to renew an existing project or contract, or shift to a competing supplier for our high-volume products, our financial results could be adversely affected. The risk is heightened if customers are impacted by operational disruptions or trade restrictions, particularly in jurisdictions such as China. Because contract manufacturers often serve the same OEM, a reduction in demand from that OEM could significantly impact our revenue across multiple customer accounts. The adverse effect could be more substantial if we are unable to offset the loss by generating increased orders from other existing customers or by securing new design wins. Significant reductions in sales to our largest customers, the loss of other major customers, a general decrease in demand, or our failure to expand our customer base, particularly in key markets, would materially impact our future operating results.Even when we meet our customers’ technical and pricing requirements, our success ultimately depends on the commercial success of their products that incorporate our solutions. If those products fail to gain market acceptance or are discontinued, or if customers decide not to continue with follow-on projects, our revenue may decline.Additionally, our customers generally do not enter into long-term volume purchase commitments. As a result, even longstanding relationships do not guarantee future revenue. Shifts in customer strategies, product transitions, or macroeconomic factors could lead to reduced demand for our products. We may also incur significant R&D and sales-related expenses in support of these customers, without assurance of recovering those investments.We depend on third parties for manufacturing and supply, and face risks from inventory imbalances, demand uncertainty, and component shortages that may disrupt our operations and reduce margins.We depend on our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators, primarily located in Asia, to produce and assemble our products. These third parties are responsible for maintaining satisfactory manufacturing yields and delivery schedules. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements, but generally do not have long-term agreements that guarantee production capacity, pricing, or lead times. If end customer demand fluctuates unexpectedly, either rising sharply or declining, our ability to respond is constrained by limited capacity control and long lead time. Our manufacturers also serve other customers, some of whom may have greater volume commitments or purchasing leverage, which could lead to a re-prioritization of production at our expense. Qualifying new contract manufacturers, specifically semiconductor foundries, is time consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. We may also encounter lower manufacturing yields and longer delivery schedules in commencing volume production of new products that we introduce, which could increase our costs or disrupt our supply of such products. In addition, a foundry or supplier may become unavailable to us as a result of economic or political instability. The loss of relationships with our contract manufacturers or assemblers, or their inability to conduct their manufacturing and assembly services for us as anticipated in terms of capacity, cost, quality and timeliness, could adversely affect our ability to fill customer orders in accordance with required delivery, quality and performance requirements and adversely affect our operating results.We also face significant risk from forecasting errors, inventory imbalances, and order variability. We typically sell pursuant to customer purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments, and customers may delay, cancel, or fail to honor their orders. If we overestimate demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory; if we underestimate, we may lack sufficient inventory or manufacturing capacity to meet demand. Many of our customers have shifted to just-in-time inventory strategies, increasing our exposure to short-notice adjustments. Because our forecasts are based on assumptions about customer behavior, market conditions, and development timelines, any of which may prove inaccurate, our inventory and revenue may vary significantly from expectations.Supply chain disruptions can also impact upstream demand for our solutions. Our products are used in complex devices and systems that depend on numerous components. Delays in one part of the chain can lead to a broader reduction in product builds that include our technologies. In addition, we face ongoing risks from component and material shortages. Key inputs, including silicon wafers, substrates, and packaging materials, are sourced from a limited number of foreign suppliers. If these suppliers face capacity constraints, pricing shifts, or economic disruptions, we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities or meet production timelines.Without long-term supply contracts, we are exposed to price increases and allocation risk. If larger or better-financed supply chain customers secure preferential access to limited supplies, our production and costs could be adversely affected. Future shortages or procurement delays may cause missed shipments, customer dissatisfaction, and lost revenue opportunities.Altogether, uncertainty in demand forecasting, reliance on outsourced manufacturing, and limited sourcing alternatives may materially impact our operating results, margins, and ability to fulfill customer expectations.12Table of ContentsDefects, security vulnerabilities, or performance failures in our products could result in liability, reputational harm, and lost revenue opportunities.We develop complex solutions that are integrated into customer devices across the IoT, Enterprise, Automotive, and Mobile markets. These products must meet high standards for performance, security, and reliability. Despite rigorous testing, our solutions may contain defects, errors, or vulnerabilities that result from issues in design, materials, manufacturing, packaging, or software integration. Development in new technology domains, including use of smaller geometry nodes and advanced AI features, increases the risk of product failure or low yield. Vulnerabilities can also be introduced via third-party or open source software, or through malicious actions by external actors. Such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities could give rise to significant costs (including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, repairing or replacing defective products, writing down defective inventory or indemnification obligations under our agreements), could result in the loss of sales and divert the attention of our personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, a loss of design wins, a shifting of business to our competitors, product liability claims and litigation or regulatory action against us, and could harm our reputation, our relationships with customers and our ability to attract new customers, as well as the perceptions of our brand. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate, may not cover the claims, and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.Our customers often integrate our solutions into devices that interact with untrusted systems or process large volumes of data. If our solutions fail, or introduce security risks to the customer’s end product, it may result in operational disruption, loss or theft of sensitive data, regulatory exposure, or product recalls. Mitigation tools, such as firmware patches or configuration updates, may not always be timely or fully effective. Any such failures could harm our reputation, delay or reduce revenue, lead to loss of design wins, shift business to competitors, or result in legal claims or indemnity obligations. While we maintain product liability insurance, coverage may be limited or unavailable in future periods.Additionally, we generally warrant our products for 12 months from the date of delivery. Although we have not experienced widespread recalls, manufacturing defects or quality issues could result in revenue deferrals, warranty costs, or strained customer relationships. Addressing such issues can divert engineering resources from strategic initiatives and negatively affect profitability.If we fail to manage our growth and scale our operations effectively, our infrastructure and resources could be strained, our ability to effectively manage our business could be diminished and our operating results could suffer.As we expand our product portfolio and customer base, we must scale our global organization efficiently to meet increasing demand. This includes the ability to: hire, train and retain talent globally; plan, expand, or optimize facilities; enhance operational and management systems; and scale development and production capacity. We also may incur significant expenses in anticipation of future orders that do not materialize, particularly in Core IoT, Enterprise, Automotive, and Mobile markets. These upfront investments—whether in personnel, infrastructure, or supply—could negatively impact profitability if not matched by revenue growth.In some cases, customers may require rapid increases in design or production support, placing short-term strain on our internal teams and contract manufacturers. If we or our partners cannot expand quickly enough, we may lose revenue opportunities or damage customer relationships. Failure to manage growth and align resources with demand could materially impact our business, operational efficiency, and financial performance.Our ability to protect our intellectual property, avoid infringement of third-party rights, and manage licensing compliance, including with open source software, is critical to our competitiveness and subject to legal risk.We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technologies. However, we cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other third-party proprietary rights. Patents may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Trade secrets may be compromised if confidentiality measures fail or are not consistently applied, and trademark rights may be challenged or unenforceable in certain jurisdictions. Our protection efforts face limitations, particularly in foreign markets such as China, where IP enforcement is less predictable. In the past, we have not always required all employees, consultants, suppliers, or partners to enter into formal written agreement for the protection of our technology including confidentiality or invention assignment agreements, and some may seek to assert rights in our technologies or use them without authorization. The risk of inadvertent disclosure is further heightened by employee use of generative or third-party AI tools. Any claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources, including the attention of management, and could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may include terms that may not be commercially reasonable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 13Table of ContentsIn addition, we license certain technology used in and for our products from third parties, including open source components. Open source software is generally made available “as is” and may impose obligations that require us to disclose our own source code or make our products freely available. Although we monitor our use of such software, inadvertent noncompliance could expose us to claims, require product modifications, or restrict product distribution. Also, there can be no assurances that such third-party technology will remain available to us on commercially acceptable terms. We cannot be certain that our products do not infringe third-party intellectual property rights. If third parties assert claims of infringement, we could be subject to significant litigation expenses, damage awards, or injunctions. We may be forced to obtain licenses on unfavorable terms, redesign products, or cease selling certain offerings. In some cases, licenses may not be available at all. We may also have to pay substantial damages to third parties or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violates any third-party intellectual property rights. Any adverse outcome in a licensing dispute or infringement action could materially impact our ability to manufacture, market, or support our products. Additionally, defending or enforcing our rights, whether successful or not, can result in substantial legal expenses, operational disruption, and diversion of management attention, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results.Foreign exchange rate volatility could adversely affect our margins, pricing and competitiveness.A substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the United States, while a significant portion of our operating expenses, including R&D, supply chain and employee compensation, are denominated in foreign currencies such as the New Taiwan dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan and Israeli shekel. Although we transact business predominantly in U.S. dollars and we invoice and collect our sales in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates can materially impact our results of operations and financial position. A strengthening U.S. dollar could reduce the local currency revenue of our international customers, potentially weakening demand or triggering pricing pressure. Conversely, a weakening of the U.S. dollar could increase our cost of goods sold and operating expenses and cause our overseas vendors to require renegotiation of either the prices or currency we pay for their goods and services. In the future, customers may negotiate pricing and make payments in non-U.S. currencies. If our overseas vendors or customers require us to transact business in non-U.S. currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods, operating expenses and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. Moreover, our reliance on contract manufacturers and suppliers based in Asia subjects us to risks if their local currencies appreciate significantly. Exchange rate movements may also lead to gains or losses on intercompany balances, supplier payments or cash held in foreign subsidiaries. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not freely traded. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. Prolonged shifts in currency rates may make our products more expensive to produce or less competitive in certain markets. Accordingly, foreign currency fluctuations have and could continue to negatively affect our revenue, gross margins and operating income.We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks.We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks of our computer systems or those of our third-party representatives, vendors and service providers. Although we have implemented security procedures and controls to address these threats, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, ransomware and other attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. If our systems, or systems owned by third parties affiliated with our company, were breached or attacked, the proprietary and confidential information of our company, our employees and our customers could be disclosed and we may be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including the following: liability for stolen assets or information; fines imposed on us by governmental authorities for failure to comply with privacy laws or for disclosure of any personally identifiable information as a part of such attack; costs of repairing damage to our systems; lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack; loss of competitive advantage if our proprietary information is obtained by competitors as a result of such breach or attack; increased costs of cyber security protection; costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; damage to our reputation; increased cyber liability and data breach insurance premiums; and expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyberattack. Third parties with which we conduct business, such as foundries, assembly and test contractors and distributors, have access to certain portions of our sensitive data, and we rely on third parties to store and otherwise process data for us. We are dependent on the information security systems of these third parties and they face substantial security risks similar to those outlined above. Any security breaches or incidents or other unauthorized access by third parties to the systems of our suppliers, service providers or other third parties with access to our sensitive data, or the existence of computer viruses, ransomware or other malicious code in their data, software or hardware, could result in disruptions or failures of systems used in our business. Any of the foregoing, or the perception any of them has occurred, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial 14Table of Contentsresults. In addition, any compromise of security from a security breach or cyberattack could deter customers or business partners from entering into transactions that involve providing confidential information to us. As a result, any compromise to the security of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results.Risks Related to Acquisitions and Strategic AlliancesAny acquisitions or strategic alliances that we undertake could be difficult to execute or integrate, may not achieve expected results, and could disrupt our business or dilute stockholder value.We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses or technologies, or to engage in strategic alliances, related to other businesses and technologies to complement our current solutions, expand into existing or new markets, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise accelerate growth. However, we may be unable to identify suitable targets or partners, or complete transactions on acceptable terms. Rising valuations, regulatory scrutiny, or competitive interest may limit our ability to secure attractive opportunities.If completed, any such acquisitions and alliances carry significant risks. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses effectively, align operations, or achieve expected synergies. Integration may be complicated by differences in systems, culture, or geography—particularly in international transactions. Acquisitions or alliances may disrupt our operations, divert management’s attention, or result in unanticipated liabilities, restructuring costs, or impairment charges.We may also issue stock, incur debt, or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions, which could dilute stockholder value or increase our financial risk. If acquired businesses or investments underperform, we may not realize the intended strategic or financial benefits. For example, in fiscal 2025, we recorded a $13.8 million impairment charge related to technology acquired in fiscal 2024, reflecting changes in customer demand and product development priorities. Additional impairments may arise if other acquisitions or strategic partnerships do not meet our financial expectations. In addition, strategic alliances may involve joint development, product integration, supply or distribution arrangements, or investment. However, alliances may fail to meet their objectives or be terminated prematurely. If our partners fail to perform, or if anticipated synergies do not materialize, our ability to deliver new products or enter target markets may be impaired. The failure of any acquisition or alliance to achieve its intended benefits could adversely affect our growth, competitiveness, or financial results.Risks Related to Our EmployeesWe depend on key personnel who would be difficult to replace and our business will likely be harmed if we lose their services, cannot hire additional qualified personnel or do not manage transitions effectively.We compete in a highly technical industry that requires a workforce with deep domain expertise in areas such as edge AI, wireless IP, System on a Chip architecture, video processing and embedded firmware. Our future success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and develop highly skilled engineers, program managers and leadership across our global R&D centers, including in the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Israel and India. The market for semiconductor engineering talent is highly competitive and employee attrition or difficulty hiring in key geographies could delay product development, reduce innovation or harm customer delivery schedules. In addition, restrictive immigration policies, labor market saturation or compensation pressures could affect our access to technical talent. Our compensation programs, which include cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating and retaining qualified personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to use our share-based compensation programs to effectively compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent without significantly increasing cash compensation costs. We may also be impacted if a competitor recruits key employees, or we experience attrition in our senior leadership without adequate succession planning. In addition, in May 2025, we announced the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer. Transitions in executive leadership may result in strategic business and operational changes, shifts in personnel priorities and/or uncertainty among employees, customers and investors. Any failure to effectively manage this transition, or to retain senior leaders in critical roles across the organization, could impact continuity, delay initiatives or reduce morale. Such turnover can also disrupt long-term customer relationships, strategic execution or internal governance.15Table of ContentsIf we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of share-based compensation award programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or may be required to increase the cash element of our compensation program.Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel. This challenge is amplified by our significant presence in Silicon Valley, where competition for talent is particularly fierce. Our compensation program, which includes cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining qualified personnel. In particular, we use broad-based equity awards to foster an ownership mindset and align employee incentives with long-term stockholder value. Our success depends on our continued ability to use our share-based compensation programs to effectively compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent without significantly increasing cash compensation costs. In prior years, proxy advisory firms have recommended that stockholders vote against our equity incentive plan, primarily citing a burn rate that exceeded such firms’ caps or industry norms, and a lower shareholder value transfer (SVT) relative to peers. While we believe these concerns do not adequately reflect our philosophy of broad-based equity participation and its importance to attracting and retaining our talent, such recommendations may influence stockholder voting outcomes. In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of our share-based compensation programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or we may be required to increase the cash elements of our compensation program to account for this disadvantage.Risks Factors Related to Our Future Growth, Capital Requirements and IndebtednessWe may need to raise additional capital to support our growth, and failure to do so on acceptable terms could limit our ability to compete.To remain competitive and support our strategic initiatives, we must continue investing in research and development, product innovation, marketing, and business development. These efforts may require additional capital beyond our current cash flows. If we are unable to raise funds through equity or debt financing on favorable terms, our ability to expand our business, execute on our roadmap, or pursue strategic acquisitions could be constrained.Raising capital may also involve risks. Equity financing could dilute existing stockholders and negatively affect our stock price, while debt financing could increase interest expense and impose restrictive covenants. The timing and amount of any needed capital is uncertain and will depend on a variety of factors, including our operating performance, market conditions, and investment opportunities.Our outstanding debt, credit covenants, and convertible note obligations may limit our financial flexibility, expose us to liquidity risk, and result in stockholder dilution or adverse market impacts.We have significant outstanding indebtedness, including our 4.000% Senior Notes due 2029 and our 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 (“2031 Notes”). We may incur additional debt under our credit agreement or the indentures, which could amplify the risks described below. Our debt could make it more difficult to meet our obligations, increase our sensitivity to interest rate changes, reduce funds available for operations or investments, and limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or the broader economy. Additionally, the covenants in our credit agreement impose restrictions on our ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, create liens, make certain investments, merge or transfer assets, pay dividends or repurchase capital stock, enter into transactions with affiliates, amend subordinated debt, or enter into new lines of business. The credit agreement also contains financial covenants which limit the consolidated total net leverage ratio and the consolidated net interest coverage ratio. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, we may be in default, which could result in acceleration of our obligations and potential foreclosure on secured assets. Even if we can obtain alternative financing, it may not be on favorable terms.The 2031 Notes require us to make cash payments upon conversion or a fundamental change, and we may not have sufficient liquidity to do so. Our ability to make scheduled payments of interest under our 2031 Notes, or to refinance such indebtedness, depends on our future performance, including sufficient cash flow from operations for debt service, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control, including those described in this report. If our operating cash flow is insufficient, we may need to raise additional capital, sell assets, or restructure debt, which will depend on conditions in the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, among other factors, which could result in a default on our debt obligations or other material adverse effects on our business and financial condition. Subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2031 Notes can require us to repurchase their notes. Upon conversion of the 2031 Notes in accordance with their terms, unless we elect to solely deliver shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares), we will be required, under the default 16Table of Contentssettlement method, to settle the principal amount of the 2031 Notes in cash, and any conversion involving cash settlement could
significantly affect our liquidity. The conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders to the extent we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering shares of our common stock. Historically, we have elected to satisfy our convertible senior note conversion obligations through the payment of cash in certain circumstances, the issuance of shares of common stock in other circumstances or a combination thereof, to such convertible senior note holders.In addition, in connection with the issuance of each series of the convertible senior notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions to reduce the potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon any conversion or settlement of the convertible notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make above the principal amount of such convertible senior notes. These counterparties or their respective affiliates may engage in hedging activities, such as buying or selling our common stock or related derivatives, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.The trading price of the 2031 Notes may also be volatile due to fluctuations in our common stock price, and there is currently no active trading market for the 2031 Notes.We may incur material environmental liabilities as a result of prior operations at an acquired company.In connection with our acquisition in July 2017 of Conexant Systems, we agreed to assume certain environmental liabilities, including remediation of environmental impacts at a property formerly owned and operated by Conexant (“Conexant Site”) and for potential future claims alleging personal injury or property damage related to the environmental impacts at and about the Conexant Site. We continue to incur costs to investigate and remediate the Conexant Site’s environmental impacts, and we are at risk for future personal injury and property damage claims related to the Conexant Site. Various federal, state and local authorities regulate the release of hazardous substances into the environment and can impose substantial fines if our remediation efforts at or about the Conexant Site fail or are deemed inadequate. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination at the Conexant Site, the implementation of new technology at the Conexant Site or the establishment or imposition of stricter federal, state or local cleanup standards or requirements with respect to the Conexant Site, could require us to incur additional costs in the future that could have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.General Risk FactorsChanges in U.S. and foreign tax laws, implementation of Pillar Two and OBBBA, or adverse audit outcomes could materially affect our effective tax rate, financial position, and cash flows.We are subject to U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we do business, including U.S. taxes on certain foreign subsidiary earnings. Changes in tax laws or regulations, domestically or internationally, could adversely affect our effective tax rate, deferred tax assets, or overall financial condition. In particular, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Pillar Two framework introduces a 15% global minimum tax that jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Japan have begun implementing. We currently do not anticipate a material impact to our fiscal 2026 tax rate or cash flows, but we will continue to monitor legislative developments and recognize any Pillar Two-related amounts as period costs.In addition, effective July 4, 2025, the enactment date for U.S. GAAP purposes, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) introduced sweeping tax changes, including permanent extensions of certain provisions originally enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. A previously proposed retaliatory tax on foreign companies (Section 899) was removed following a G7 agreement. We continue to assess the accounting and operational impacts of OBBBA, particularly under ASC 740, and its implications for our future financial reporting and tax planning.We are also subject to periodic examinations by tax authorities, and the calculation of our tax liabilities requires significant judgment. Adjustments may arise from audit resolutions, amended filings, changes in tax interpretations, or expiration of statutes of limitation. Outcomes inconsistent with our expectations could materially impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period due to factors such as: shifts in the mix and geographic location of earnings and assets; changes in entity structure or business operations; audit outcomes and related interest or penalties; revaluations of deferred tax assets or changes in tax credit availability; new tax laws or accounting standards, including implementation of BEPS 2.0 or OBBBA; and our decision to repatriate foreign earnings subject to additional taxes.17Table of ContentsWe are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection.We collect, use and store personally identifiable information (“PII”) as part of our business and operations. We are subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The cost of complying with and implementing these privacy-related and data governance measures could be significant as they may create additional burdensome security, business process, business record or data localization requirements. The theft, loss or misuse of PII collected, used, stored or transferred by us, or any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or our failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, including litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors.There is an increasing focus from lawmakers, regulators, investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters, including environment, climate, diversity and inclusion, human rights and governance transparency. A number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include ESG provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions. An increasing number of investors are also requiring companies to disclose ESG-related policies, practices and metrics. In addition, various jurisdictions are developing climate-related laws or regulations that could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These legal and regulatory requirements, as well as investor expectations on ESG practices and disclosures, are subject to change, can be unpredictable and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and our outsourced manufacturing. Further, there is an increasing number of anti-ESG initiatives in areas of the United States and elsewhere that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’ expectations. If we fail to comply with or meet the evolving legal and regulatory requirements or expectations of our various stakeholders, we may be subject to enforcement actions, required to pay fines, customers may stop purchasing products from us or investors may sell their shares, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations. Additionally, we may be subject to litigation and claims by third parties or regulatory bodies that our stated CGS initiatives and objectives have not been achieved or implemented appropriately. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve our CGS-related initiatives could negatively impact our reputation or harm our business.The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following: quarterly financial results, changes in guidance, or perceived success in customer design wins—particularly in our key markets of consumer, automotive, IoT, and mobile applications. As a fabless semiconductor company, we are also exposed to industry cycles characterized by shifts in demand, inventory corrections, overcapacity, and pricing volatility. Additionally, trade restrictions, export controls, and geopolitical tensions—especially involving China, a major region for our supply chain and customers—can significantly impact investor sentiment and contribute to share price volatility. Perceptions of our competitive position in areas such as artificial intelligence, edge computing, and wireless connectivity may also drive valuation changes unrelated to actual performance.Our trading price may also be affected by broader market factors or rumors involving us, our customers, suppliers, competitors, or potential strategic transactions. Announcements of new technologies, product releases, patent disputes, regulatory developments, executive transitions, or significant customer orders may lead to disproportionate movements in our stock price. In addition, stocks of technology and semiconductor companies have historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to underlying business performance. As a result, public announcements concerning our operations—or even general developments within the semiconductor sector—could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our actual results.18Table of ContentsITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable.ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITYRisk Management and StrategyOur cybersecurity risk management program is part of our overall approach to enterprise risk management. Our cybersecurity risk management program seeks to protect our information systems by managing and reducing material risks from cybersecurity threats and by responding to and mitigating cybersecurity incidents. We have designed our cybersecurity risk management program using certain industry practices and frameworks as a guide, including those established by the International Organization for Standardization and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, although we may not meet all technical standards, specifications or requirements. We employ a cross-functional approach to preserving the confidentiality, security and availability of the employee, customer, supplier and partner information that we collect and store.We have implemented cybersecurity processes, measures and controls to assist management in our assessment, identification and management of risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Information Security team monitors events, analyzes threats and coordinates our incident response pursuant to our incident response plan, which includes the process to be followed for reporting of incidents. Our cybersecurity risk management involves identifying information assets, assessing and prioritizing risks and employing various tools and techniques to identify and remediate threats. We also leverage third party service providers to test and validate our existing processes and procedures. We conduct annual and ongoing security awareness and behavioral change training for employees to educate them on cybersecurity best practices and train them to recognize phishing attempts. We also assess and manage cybersecurity risks associated with third-party service providers, including those in our supply chain or vendors who have access to our data or systems. Our cybersecurity process is iterative, with regular reviews and updates to help improve and respond to a dynamic and continuously evolving threat landscape.We describe whether and how risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, our business strategy, our results of operations or our financial condition under the heading “We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks” included as part of our risk factors disclosures in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We have not experienced a cybersecurity incident which has been determined to be material and the expenses we have incurred from cybersecurity incidents and threats were immaterial, including penalties and settlements, of which there were none.GovernanceOur Board of Directors is responsible for risk management oversight and has delegated to our Audit Committee oversight responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of our governance and management of cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee biannually reviews our policies and practices with respect to risk management, including cybersecurity risks, and reports its findings to the full Board of Directors. The Audit Committee also receives a report containing information security risk posture details, remediation plan execution progress and pertinent threat intelligence updates from the heads of the IT Security and Internal Audit departments on a regular basis, typically biannually. At least annually, but more frequently as necessary, threats from cybersecurity risks and our action plans relating to those risks, also are considered by the full Board during meeting discussions of enterprise risks. Members of management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer and Chief Legal Officer, may also report directly to the Board of Directors on significant risk management issues, including cybersecurity threats and incidents.We have an Information Security Management Steering Committee (“ISMS Committee”), comprised of our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), as well as members of our executive team, including our Chief Information Office and Chief Legal Officer. Our Chief Information Officer and CISO, in coordination with the ISMS Committee, work collaboratively to implement our enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards, architecture and processes. Our InfoSec team communicates with and reports to the CISO, enabling the CISO, Cyber Incident Response Team and ISMS Committee to monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. Our CISO has significant experience managing global IT operations, including strategy, applications, infrastructure, information security, support and execution.19Table of ContentsITEM 2.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESMarket Information on Common StockOur common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (formerly the Nasdaq National Market) under the symbol “SYNA” since January 29, 2002. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock.StockholdersAs of August 12, 2025, there were approximately 110 holders of record of our common stock. The closing price of our common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market as of August 12, 2025, was $67.49.DividendsWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently plan to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business, make debt payments or purchase shares under our common stock repurchase program. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, operating results and capital requirements as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.Our Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our Senior Notes also place restrictions on the payment of any dividends. For a further description of the terms of the Credit Agreement and our Senior Notes indenture, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 8. Debt and Revolving Credit Facility.”Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesDuring fiscal year 2025, we conducted repurchases under our previously authorized stock repurchase programs. The most recent of these programs expired in July 2025. As a result, on August 5, 2025, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $150 million of our common stock. This program does not have an expiration date; however, the Board will periodically review the authorization to assess its continued appropriateness in light of the Company’s capital allocation priorities and market conditions. Repurchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are intended to comply with Rule 10b‑18 under the Exchange Act.The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases depend on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities.During the three-month period ended June 28, 2025, repurchases under the previously authorized stock repurchase programs were as follows:PeriodTotal Number of Shares PurchasedAverage Price Paid Per ShareTotal Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or ProgramsApproximate Dollar Value of shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1)March 30, 2025 - April 26, 2025319,783 49.91319,783 $765,642,720 April 27, 2025 - May 24, 2025— — — $765,642,720 May 25, 2025 - June 28, 2025— — — $765,642,720 Total319,783 (1) The most recent of the stock repurchase program expired in July 2025.

The performance graph will not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing of our company under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act.In fiscal 2025, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index (“PHLX”) was selected as the most appropriate comparator index for the Company based on the characteristics of its constituents. This will be the last year that we present the Nasdaq Composite Index in the performance graph.We operate on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year which ends on the last Saturday in June. Accordingly, the last day of our fiscal year varies. For consistent presentation and comparison to the industry indices shown herein, we have calculated our stock performance graph assuming a June 30 year end. The following graph shows a five-year comparison of cumulative total return on our common stock, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index, Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russell 2000 Index from June 30, 2020 through June 30, 2025. The graph assumes an investment of $100 on June 30, 2020. The calculations of cumulative stockholder return on the Nasdaq Composite Index, the Russell 2000 Index and the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index include the assumed reinvestment of any dividends. The calculation of cumulative stockholder return on our common stock does not include the assumed reinvestment of dividends because we did not pay any dividends during the measurement period.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSForward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect ResultsYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth elsewhere in this report and under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”IntroductionIn this section, we will discuss the results of our operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Discussions of our fiscal 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between our fiscal 2024 and 2023 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our fiscal 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2024.OverviewWe are a leading worldwide developer and fabless supplier of premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions. We develop solutions that integrate the audio, touch and vision interfaces with embedded processing capabilities that are paired with wireless connectivity. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products and solutions that meet the demanding design specifications of our OEMs.In fiscal 2025, we achieved revenue growth with net revenue increasing 12% to $1,074.3 million compared to $959.4 million in fiscal 2024. The growth was primarily driven by strong execution in our Core IoT product category. Net revenue from Core IoT of $272.4 million increased by 53% compared to $177.6 million a year ago. This growth was fueled primarily by strong demand for our wireless connectivity products and the inclusion of sales from our Broadcom transaction. Enterprise and Automotive net revenue of $610.1 million increased by 7% compared to $570.0 million a year ago. The net increase was primarily driven by growth across our enterprise product portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in automotive revenue due to softness in the automotive sector. Mobile net revenue of $191.8 million decreased by 9% compared to $211.8 million a year ago, primarily as a result of the end-of-life shipments to a large U.S. mobile customer.During the year, we launched multiple products expanding our product portfolios and accelerated our position in Edge AI and wireless connectivity through partnerships and licensing transactions. We are collaborating with Google’s research team to build the next-generation platform for Edge AI devices. We executed an agreement with Broadcom in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 to acquire certain assets and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to Broadcom’s Wi-Fi technology. We acquired these set of assets in order to solidify our leadership position for end-to-end AI IoT connectivity. Acquiring these assets allows us to expand our portfolio of Wi-Fi 8 combination devices that include advanced Bluetooth features, additional Wi-Fi 7 combination devices, ultrawide band intellectual property (which we can integrate into future IoT devices) and combination front-end modules. This transaction expands our field of use, allowing all our Wi-Fi products to compete in AR/VR, Android smartphones and consumer audio markets and secures our wireless roadmap for the next five years. We introduced the S3930 touch controller, featuring multi-frequency-region parallel sensing and the industry’s smallest high-performance footprint. This innovation enables consistent, low-latency touch performance in ultra-thin, bendable devices. The new solution is more cost-effective for applications such as foldable phones and large screens.Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 totaled $391.5 million and $876.9 million, respectively. Our net total debt outstanding at the end of fiscal 2025 was $834.8 million compared to $972.9 million at the end of fiscal 2024. We repaid our $582.0 million Term Loan Facility through a combination of a $450.0 million convertible senior note offering and balance sheet cash. We executed a capped call transaction to mitigate dilution up to a stock price of $150.48.During fiscal 2025, we returned $128.3 million to shareholders through repurchase of approximately 1.8 million shares. Our share repurchase program expired in July 2025 and a new repurchase program of $150.0 million was authorized thereafter, with no expiration date.23Table of ContentsTrends and UncertaintiesCurrent Economic ConditionsAs a majority of our sales and manufacturing occurs outside of the U.S., we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. In particular, a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from customers located in international markets, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, including China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, where many of our OEM customers and contract manufacturers are based. As a result, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, especially relative to the U.S. dollar, can materially impact our reported revenue and profitability. We continue to monitor changes in international trade policies, particularly increased tariffs and other barriers or restrictions between the United States and other countries, including China. Our current operations suggest limited tariff exposure given our current import and export practices. However, some of our customers and suppliers may be impacted by evolving tariff regimes depending on their own supply chain strategies and sourcing locations. We continue to monitor for any potential customer and supplier impacts, ranging from supply chain realignments to changes in end demand. While the broader implications of these activities remain uncertain, based on our current lead times and order activity, we are not seeing unusual activity that would suggest any acceleration or delays in orders due to tariffs that would be likely to impact our near-term financial performance. We will continue to assess the short-term and long-term effects of these international trade policies and restrictions on our financial and operational performance.Results of OperationsThe following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of operations data for fiscal 2025 and 2024 along with comparative information regarding the absolute and percentage changes in these amounts (in millions, except percentages):2025% of net sales2024% of net salesEnterprise and Automotive product applications$610.1 56.8%$570.0 59.4%Core IoT product applications272.4 25.4%177.6 18.5%Mobile product applications191.8 17.8%211.8 22.1%Net revenue1,074.3 100.0%959.4 100.0%Gross margin480.4 44.7%439.8 45.8%Operating expenses:Research and development346.8 32.3%336.3 35.1%Selling, general and administrative180.3 16.8%161.3 16.8%Acquired intangibles amortization16.7 1.5%17.3 1.8%Intangible asset impairment charge13.8 1.3%16.0 1.7%Restructuring costs16.9 1.6%10.5 1.1%Total operating expenses574.5 53.5%541.4 56.5%Operating (loss)/income(94.1)(8.8%)(101.6)(10.6%)Interest and other income26.9 2.5%42.3 4.4%Interest expense(39.8)(3.7%)(65.3)(6.8%)Loss on early retirement of debt(6.5)(0.6%)— —%(Loss)/income before provision for income taxes(113.5)(10.6%)(124.6)(13.0%)(Benefit)/provision for income taxes(65.7)(6.2%)(250.2)(26.1%)Net (loss)/income$(47.8)(4.4)%$125.6 13.1 %Fiscal 2025 Compared with Fiscal 2024Net Revenue.Net revenue was $1,074.3 million for fiscal 2025 compared with $959.4 million for fiscal 2024, an increase of $114.9 million, or 12.0%. Of this net revenue, $610.1 million, or 56.8%, was from Enterprise and Automotive product applications, $272.4 million, or 25.4%, was from the Core IoT product applications market and $191.8 million, or 17.8%, was from the Mobile product applications market. Revenue increased in most of our product applications in fiscal 2025. Net revenue from Enterprise and Automotive product applications increased as a result of an increase in units sold (which increased 10.4%) and an increase in average selling prices (which increased 2.4%) due to our product sales mix compared 24Table of Contentsto the same period a year ago. The increase in revenue from Enterprise and Automotive product applications was partially offset by a decrease of $30.0 million in revenue from the licensing of certain of our IP. The increase in net revenue from Core IoT product applications was driven by an increase in units sold (which increased 40.8%) and an increase in average selling prices (which increased 8.9%) due to our product sales mix compared to the same period a year ago, inclusive of the contribution from the Broadcom transaction. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased due to a decrease in units sold (which decreased 1.8%) and a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 10.3%) as overall demand decreased for our products in the mobile market compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in revenue from Mobile product applications was partially offset by an increase of $4.5 million in revenue from the licensing of certain of our IP.Gross Margin.Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 44.7% in fiscal 2025 compared with 45.8% in fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross margin was driven by an increase in amortization expense primarily related to the intangible assets we acquired from Broadcom and a decrease in revenue from the licensing of certain of our IP. For additional information, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 7. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets.”Because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. Under most circumstances, revenue from license-based arrangements is fully accretive to our gross margin.Operating Expenses.Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased $10.5 million, to $346.8 million, for fiscal 2025 compared with $336.3 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $19.8 million increase in variable compensation related to bonus accruals and a $7.9 million increase in stock-based compensation charges primarily driven by the charges related to the awards granted to the Broadcom employees we onboarded during the third quarter of fiscal 2025. These increases were partially offset by a $16.3 million decrease in payroll related costs primarily driven by the restructuring action we initiated in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $19.0 million, to $180.3 million, for fiscal 2025 compared with $161.3 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $11.6 million increase in variable compensation related to bonus accruals, a $8.3 million increase in professional service fees primarily related to the Broadcom transaction we executed in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and the refinancing of our Term Loan Facility in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and a $4.5 million unfavorable impact from exchange rates on foreign currencies, partially offset by a $8.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation charges primarily related to an increase in net forfeitures from the departure of certain executive officers from the Company compared to fiscal 2024.Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 7. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets.”Intangible asset impairment charge. Intangible asset impairment reflects the impairment of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 7. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets.”Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring action we initiated in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development and selling, general and administrative functions. Restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 were $16.9 million and $10.5 million, respectively. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 19. Restructuring Activities.”Non-Operating Income.Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income decreased $15.4 million, to $26.9 million in fiscal 2025 compared with $42.3 million in fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by an overall decrease in our invested cash and cash equivalents of approximately $400.0 million.Interest Expense. Interest expense primarily includes interest on our debt and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. Interest expense decreased by $25.5 million to $39.8 million during fiscal 2025 as compared to $65.3 million during 25Table of Contentsfiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by the early repayment of the Term Loan Facility in November 2024. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the interest expense on the Term Loan Facility was $18.7 million and $46.1 million, respectively. The Term Loan Facility was repaid with the net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2031 Notes, which bears a significantly lower interest rate of 0.75%. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 8. Debt and Revolving Credit Facility.”(Benefit)/Provision for Income Taxes. The (benefit)/provision for income taxes of $(65.7) million and $(250.2) million in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to a one-time tax benefit related to a U.S. “check-the-box” election made for our Israel subsidiary, favorable tax effects from the U.S. inclusion of foreign income, foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and a tax benefit associated with the fiscal 2018 U.S. transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) resulting from a recent U.S. Tax Court decision in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Commissioner. These benefits were partially offset by non-deductible share-based compensation and limitation on the deductibility of a certain officer’s compensation. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 16. Income Taxes.”On July 4, 2025, subsequent to the end of our fiscal 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was signed into law. This legislation includes a permanent extension and modification of certain provisions under the TCJA. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the OBBBA on our financial statements for future periods.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur cash and cash equivalents were $391.5 million as of the end of fiscal 2025 compared with $876.9 million as of the end of fiscal 2024, a decrease of $485.4 million. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was driven by cash used in financing activities of $331.4 million related to full repayment of our Term Loan Facility and repurchases of our common stock, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of the 2031 Notes (as defined below) and cash used in investing activities of $297.9 million primarily related to our asset purchase agreement with Broadcom.We consider almost all earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely reinvested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of the end of fiscal 2025, $341.3 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we will be able to repatriate these funds without a material impact on our provision for income taxes.Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Operating activities during fiscal 2025 generated $142.0 million compared with $135.9 million net cash generated in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was the primarily driven by our results of operations, adjusted for non-cash charges of $219.0 million, and net cash outflows of $29.2 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the change in operating assets and liabilities relate to a decrease in income taxes payable primarily related to net tax payments of approximately $43.3 million made to various tax jurisdictions and an increase in net inventory of $25.1 million, related to the availability of supply and the impact of variations between forecasted and actual demand, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $12.3 million, primarily related to the timing of collections and billings, and an increase of $31.5 million in accrued compensation primarily related to the accrual of our annual bonus.Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2025 was $297.9 million compared with cash used in investing activities of $157.7 million during fiscal 2024. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2025 primarily consisted of $200.3 million we paid to acquire certain assets and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to Broadcom’s Wi-Fi technology and the purchase of $61.0 million in short-term investments.Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2025 was $331.4 million compared with $25.1 million used in financing activities for fiscal 2024. Net cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2025 consisted of $583.5 million used to repay the remaining outstanding balance of our Term Loan Facility, $128.3 million used to repurchase our common stock, exclusive of excise taxes, and $49.9 million used for the payment of capped call transactions associated with our 2031 Notes, partially offset by $439.5 million in net proceeds from issuance of our 2031 Notes.LiquidityWe have $350.0 million available under our revolving credit facility with a maturity date to be the earlier of November 2029 or three months prior to any maturity of our Senior Notes. No funds were drawn from this credit facility during fiscal 2025.26Table of ContentsOur aggregate principal debt obligations were $850.0 million as of June 2025 and mature at various dates through December 2031. In connection with our issuance of the 2031 Notes, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2031 Notes, along with our cash on hand, to repay the outstanding balance of our Term Loan Facility.See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 8. Debt and Revolving Credit Facility.”Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. For our operating lease obligations, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 9. Leases.” For our purchase obligations, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies.”Working Capital Needs. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities and available credit under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including small tuck-in acquisitions, and our debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained.The undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not currently required to meet our U.S. working capital and other cash requirements, but should we repatriate a portion of these earnings, we may be required to pay certain previously accrued state and foreign taxes, which would impact our cash flows.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments in applying our most critical accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements.The SEC has defined critical accounting estimates as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult, complex or subjective judgments or estimates. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventory valuation, business combinations, goodwill and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the bases for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with our expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.We believe the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.Revenue recognitionWe recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of goods to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently with each customer on a stand-alone basis. In evaluating the transaction price, we assess whether it is subject to adjustment or refund, such as stock rotation rights, price protection or volume-based incentives, and we estimate the resulting variable consideration accordingly. Although such arrangements occur in limited circumstances, they require judgment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled. We estimate variable consideration based on the historical data and experience with returns, rebates and credits. We believe these amounts to be immaterial to total revenue and do not anticipate significant changes to our estimates. This estimate qualifies as a critical accounting estimate due to the subjective judgments required to assess 27Table of Contentsvariable consideration and the potential impact on revenue recognition timing and amount, even if the current magnitude of such estimates is limited.Inventory ValuationWe value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost and estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for our products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products and changes in customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost and net realizable value of our inventories, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices.We fully reserve for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. We perform periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. We also record a charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses for inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations or other factors.The following factors influence our estimates: changes to, or cancellations of, customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. Our reserves contain uncertainties because the calculation requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding historical experience, market conditions and technological obsolescence. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results. Due to the subjective inputs and forward-looking assumptions, this estimate qualifies as a critical accounting estimate with potential impact on gross margin and inventory-related balances.Business CombinationsAccounting for a business combination requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which involves a number of judgments, assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized in subsequent periods. We typically obtain independent third-party valuation studies to assist us in determining fair values, including assistance in estimating future cash flows, discount rates and comparable market values. Items involving significant assumptions, estimates and judgments include the following:•Fair value of consideration paid or transferred and•Intangible assets, including valuation methodology such as the income approach that includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, estimates of future revenues and costs, discount and royalty rates.We estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Due to the subjectivity and reliance on forward-looking inputs, these acquisition-related estimates qualify as critical accounting estimates.Income TaxesWe estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax return and financial statement purposes. We recognize income taxes using an asset and liability approach. This approach requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred taxes is based on the provisions of enacted tax law and the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated.Evaluating the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires judgment and analysis of all positive and negative evidence available, including recent earnings history and taxable income in recent years, reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Using available evidence and judgment, we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. Valuation allowances have been provided primarily against state research and development credits and certain capital losses of foreign subsidiaries. A change in the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets may materially impact our tax provision in the period in which a change of assessment occurs.28Table of ContentsAs a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. The taxation of our business is subject to the application of various and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions. Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses, tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, tax incentives, the availability of tax credits and loss carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies, which includes our estimates of the fair value of our intellectual property. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations, court rulings and tax audits. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities throughout the world include Japan, Hong Kong, United Kingdom, Israel and the United States.Due to the complexity of international tax laws, reliance on future projections and the significant level of judgment involved, income tax-related estimates qualify as critical accounting estimates and may impact our results of operations and financial position.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies – Accounting Pronouncements Adopted.” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies – Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted.”29Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include:Foreign Currency Exchange RiskOur total net revenue for fiscal 2025 and 2024 was denominated in U.S. dollars. Costs denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 17% of our total costs in fiscal 2025 and 2024.We face the risk that our accounts payable and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the U.S. dollar. Approximately 3% and 5% of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currencies as of June 2025 and June 2024, respectively.To provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within revenue, cost and operating expenses, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. A hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates would have changed our operating income before taxes and our net income by approximately $20.0 million for fiscal 2025, assuming no offsetting hedge positions. However, this quantitative measure has inherent limitations. The sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that U.S. dollar and other exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency.Interest Rate Risk on Cash and Cash EquivalentsOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents (money market funds and short-term investments). Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. Our cash equivalent investments have short-term maturity periods that mitigate the impact of market or interest rate risk.Based on our results of operations for fiscal 2025, a hypothetical reduction in the interest rates on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of a hypothetical increase or decrease of 50 basis points in rates compared to rates at the end of fiscal 2025 would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in interest income of approximately $2.0 million.Interest Rate Risk on DebtAs of June 2025, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.30Table of ContentsITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three fiscal year period ended June 28, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2025 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.Basis for OpinionsThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.32Table of ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Valuation of inventoriesAs discussed in Note 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company held $139.5 million of inventories as of June 28, 2025 which are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The Company records a write-down for excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions.We identified the valuation of inventories associated with excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s estimate of net realizable value for these inventories. Specifically, there is a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the effect of any unexpected or sudden declines in market demand which may result from changes to or cancellations of customer orders, rapid product improvements or technological advances, due to the nature of the evidence available related to these factors.The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s process to develop the estimated net realizable value of inventory. For a selection of inventory items, we assessed the Company’s assumptions by comparing them to historical activity and demand forecasts. As part of the procedure, we considered customer communications, as well as end user and third-party publications. For a sample of inventory items, we recalculated the required write-downs and compared this to the recorded amounts.Evaluation of the fair value of certain assets acquired in a business combinationAs discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company consummated a business combination for total consideration of $247.9 million during the year ended June 28, 2025. In connection with this business combination, the Company allocated the total estimated purchase consideration to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The Company recorded various assets, which included developed technologies, roadmap technologies, and customer contract and related relationships with acquisition-date fair values of $24.5 million, $96.8 million and $27.9 million, respectively.We identified the evaluation of the fair values allocated to developed technologies, roadmap technologies, and customer contract and related relationships as a critical audit matter. As a risk assessment procedure to determine the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of these acquired assets, we performed sensitivity analyses over certain assumptions, individually and in the aggregate, which required a high degree of auditor judgment. Due to the measurement uncertainty associated with certain key assumptions, specialized skills and knowledge were required in the evaluation of the forecasted revenue and royalty rate assumptions for the developed technologies and roadmap technologies assets and the forecasted revenue assumption for the customer contract and related relationship asset.The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s acquisition-date valuation processes, including controls related to the development of the key assumptions. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s 33Table of Contentsforecasted revenue assumptions by comparing to historical actual results of the acquired assets and certain peer and market participant data. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:•evaluating certain peer group and market participant data used in the assessment of forecasted revenue by assessing the appropriateness of the guideline comparable companies and market participant data obtained by management.•assessing the reasonableness of royalty rate by comparing to observable market royalty rates and evaluating the nature of the technologies acquired./s/ KPMG LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2003.Santa Clara, CaliforniaAugust 21, 202534Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS

amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts) Note 1. Description of BusinessWe are a leading worldwide developer and fabless supplier of premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions that enable people to engage with connected devices and data, creating exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. We provide our customers with sensing, processing and connecting solutions, which represent the three foundational elements of the Internet of Things (“IoT”). We supply connectivity, sensors and AI-enhanced processor solutions to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that design IoT products and devices for automobiles, enterprise workspace devices, virtual reality, smartphones, tablets and notebook computers.Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation and Principles of ConsolidationOur fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. The fiscal years presented in this report are the 52-week periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 24, 2023 and the 53-week period ended June 29, 2024. For simplicity, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on calendar quarter end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated.The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and include Synaptics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, allowance for credit losses, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets, valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the bases for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.Cash EquivalentsCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.Short-Term InvestmentsInvestments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents, while all other investments are classified as short-term based on management’s intent and ability to use the funds in current operations. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are reflected as interest and other income in the accompany consolidated statements of operations.We regularly review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indicators of possible impairment. Some of the factors we consider include, but are not limited to, the following: the length of time and extent to which a security’s fair value has been below its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the credit quality of the security’s issuer, the likelihood of recovery and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value.Fair Value MeasurementsWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are required to be recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in 40Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. The carrying amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements approximate the fair value for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to their short-term nature.Intangible assets, property and equipment and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our term loan is variable, which is subject to change from time-to-time to reflect a market interest rate. See “Note 6. Fair Value Measurements.”Revenue RecognitionRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers. Substantially all of our revenue is generated from product sales. Generally, our revenue is recognized at a point in time, either upon shipment or delivery of the product, in accordance with customer terms and conditions. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods and classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We account for the collection of transaction taxes on a net basis.Substantially all payments from our customers are generally due within our standard contractual terms, which do not include a significant financing component.ProductsWe transfer control and recognize revenue at a point in time when products are shipped to our customers, including OEMs and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. We recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services, net of accruals for estimated sales returns and rebates. Certain OEMs and distributors may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM and distributor agreements. We estimate the amount of variable consideration under these arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts or other price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Our accrual for estimated returns is based on historical return rates and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory expected to be returned.Intellectual property licensing arrangementsRights to our intellectual property (“IP”) are either sold or licensed to customers. Revenue recognition from the licensing of our IP is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. We recognize revenue from the licensing of our IP upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the latter of the period the sale or usage occurs or the satisfaction of performance obligations, if any, to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated.As of June 2025, we did not have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by the applicable accounting standard, we have not disclosed revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred.Allowance for Credit LossesWe maintain allowances for expected credit losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer’s potential inability to meet its financial obligation, we record a specific reserve of the estimated credit loss against amounts due. In addition, we make judgments and estimates on the collectability of accounts receivable based on our historical bad debt experience, customers’ creditworthiness, current economic trends, recent changes in customers’ payment trends and deterioration in customers’ operating results or financial position. If circumstances change adversely, additional credit loss allowances may be required. At both June 2025 and June 2024, the allowance for credit losses on our trade receivables was $4.2 million.Cost of RevenueOur cost of revenue includes the cost of products shipped to customers, which primarily includes the cost of products built to our specifications by our contract manufacturers, the cost of silicon wafers supplied by independent semiconductor wafer manufacturers and the related assembly, package and test costs of our products. Also included in our cost of revenue 41Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)are personnel and related costs, including share-based compensation for quality assurance and manufacturing support personnel; logistics costs; depreciation of equipment supporting manufacturing; amortization of acquired intangibles; fair value adjustments of inventory associated with acquired businesses; write-downs of inventory and losses on purchase obligations; and warranty costs.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. The carrying value of our inventories is reduced for any difference between costs and estimated net realizable value of total inventory that is determined to be excess, obsolete or unsellable inventory based on forecast of future demand and market conditions. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period. Once inventory is written down, a new accounting cost basis is established and, accordingly, any associated reserve is not released until the inventory is sold or scrapped.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.Foreign CurrencyThe U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in our functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. The effects of foreign currency remeasurement are reported in reported in current results of operations.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at any other time when events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The qualitative factors we assess include long-term prospects of our performance, share price trends and market capitalization and other Company-specific events. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that affect the accuracy of our assumptions, estimates and judgments.If we determine that, as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The fair value of each of our goodwill reporting units is generally estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies.We performed the qualitative goodwill impairment test in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. Based on the impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of each year presented, no goodwill impairment was recognized.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets consist primarily of intangible assets purchased through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 1 to 8 years.Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsWe evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In such cases, we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use and eventual disposition of the asset.42Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)We review the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset.LeasesWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets also include any initial direct costs and prepayments less lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, including lease term, in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease costs for short-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Share-Based CompensationWe recognize compensation expense for all of our share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. The determination of fair value of restricted and certain performance stock awards is based on the fair value of our stock on the grant date with performance awards adjusted for the actual outcome of the underlying performance condition. For awards with market-based performance conditions, we employ a Monte Carlo simulation valuation method to calculate the fair value of the awards based on the most likely outcome. We estimate the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under our Employee Stock Purchase plan (“ESPP”) using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for awards with market conditions, which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Compensation cost for performance-based awards is recognized when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be met. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur and previously recognized compensation expense is reversed for the portion of awards forfeited prior to the vesting date.Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period that includes the enactment date. We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.We use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties. However, our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances or interpretation or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period.Product WarrantyWe generally provide warranties to cover defects in workmanship, materials and manufacturing for a period of twelve months to meet the stated functionality as agreed in each sales arrangement. Products are tested against specified functionality requirements prior to delivery, but we nevertheless from time to time experience claims under our warranty guarantees. These standard warranties are assurance type warranties and do not offer any services in addition to the 43Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)assurance that the product will continue working as specified. Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement. We accrue for estimated warranty costs based upon historical experience, and for specific items, at the time their existence is known and the amounts are determinable.AcquisitionsWe account for business combinations by applying the acquisition method. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, we recognize identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. We capitalize acquisition-related costs and fees associated with asset acquisitions and immediately expense acquisition-related costs and fees associated with business combinations.We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired developed technology and discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ materially from estimates. Other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments from change in facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and that impact our preliminary estimates are recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of fair value of assets and liabilities are reported in current results of operations.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.Accounting Pronouncements AdoptedIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. See “Note 18. Segment and Other Information.”Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet AdoptedIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This ASU requires consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disclosures of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This ASU is effective for our fiscal year 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures.In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40).” This ASU requires companies to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures.Note 3.

Business Combinations and Asset AcquisitionsFiscal Year 2025 AcquisitionBroadcom Wi-Fi technologyOn January 19, 2025, we entered into definitive asset purchase agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s Wi-Fi Business in the IoT market for an aggregate consideration of $200.3 million in cash, which closed on January 30, 2025 (“Closing Date”). These assets include non-exclusive licenses to three developed technology products, property and equipment and right to obtain license of eight roadmap technology intangible assets expected to be delivered at various dates through September 2027. We also entered into transition agreements with Broadcom, under which both parties will provide one another with certain transition services (including one year inventory supply agreement in which Broadcom will facilitate Synaptics to place purchase orders with respective suppliers) following the Closing Date. We acquired these set of assets from Broadcom in order to solidify our leadership position for end-to-end AI IoT connectivity.The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the identifiable intangible assets acquired, property and equipment and long-term assets for roadmap IP based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the identifiable intangible assets acquired and long-term assets was recorded as goodwill. 45Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)Measurement period adjustments recognized in the three months ended June 2025 related primarily to updated estimated fair values for property and equipment acquired and corresponding consideration. A reconciliation of preliminary total consideration as of March 2025 and total consideration as of June 2025 is presented below:Previously reported as of March 2025Purchase Price Allocation Measurement Period AdjustmentAs AdjustedCash$198.0 $2.3 $200.3 Adjustments to consideration transferred47.6 — 47.6 Total purchase consideration$245.6 $2.3 $247.9 Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, we provided replacement equity compensation awards to the transferred employees.

These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions included the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each asset over its remaining useful life and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which ranges from 5.8% - 10.5%. The fair value of these assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the expected technological obsolescence, probability of securing future customer contracts for next generation devices and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions.Long-term assets for roadmap IPs represent a prepayment for eight technology products to be received in the future. This prepayment is classified under non-current other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Upon obtaining control of the developed technologies, the amounts recorded will be reclassified as intangible assets based on their respective fair values determined as of the Closing Date.The following table summarizes the estimate of the intangible assets as of the Closing Date:46Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in YearsEstimated Fair ValueDeveloped technology3.0$24.5 Customer contract and related relationships8.027.9 Favorable component of supply contract1.019.0 Order backlog1.07.0 IPR&D7.06.8 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles$85.2 The value of goodwill of $52.3 million reflects the anticipated synergies of the expected benefits from future generations of acquired IP and workforce of the transferred assets as of the Closing Date. As of June 2025, approximately $16.0 million of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.The consolidated financial statements include approximately $47.7 million of revenue from the Closing Date through June 2025. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to the acquisition as we had integrated a substantial portion of the acquisition into our ongoing operations at the close.We determined it is impractical to include pro forma information given the difficulty in obtaining the historical financial information for the acquisition as the business was part of Broadcom and did not have discrete financial information prior to the acquisition. Inclusion of such information would require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the acquired business historical financial results that we believe may ultimately prove inaccurate.Fiscal Year 2024 Asset AcquisitionDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we entered into an amendment to our wireless license agreement with Broadcom to license four developed technology products and to extend the exclusivity period of certain developed technologies that were previously licensed from Broadcom in July 2020 for an aggregate consideration of $130.0 million. As of June 2025, we have obtained control of three of the four technology products and the three-year extension period to exclusively license previously acquired developed technology intangible assets. Accordingly, the relative fair value of $87.5 million for those technology products is presented as acquired intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the remaining technology product of $42.5 million, for which we have not yet obtained control, is an advance payment on intangible assets and is presented within other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.Note 5.

Fair Value MeasurementsWe determine fair value based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value assumes that a transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability and establishes that the fair value of an asset or liability shall be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:•Level 1 – Valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.•Level 2 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.•Level 3 – Valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurements.Our Level 1 financial instruments are traded in active markets and the fair value is based on quoted market prices for identical instruments. The fair value of our Level 2 fixed-income securities is obtained from an independent pricing service, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or model-driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. Our marketable securities are held by custodians who obtain investment prices from a third-party pricing provider that incorporates standard inputs in various asset price models.Financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:20252024Level 1Level 2TotalLevel 1Level 2TotalAssets:Cash equivalents:Money market funds$16.7 $— $16.7 $600.4 $— $600.4 Certificates of deposit— 14.1 14.1 — 38.1 38.1 Short-term investments:Certificates of deposit— 61.0 61.0 — — — Total assets$16.7 $75.1 $91.8 $600.4 $38.1 $638.5 The above table excludes $360.7 million and $238.4 million of cash held in bank accounts at the end of June 2025 and 2024, respectively. We did not have any financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis within Level 3 fair value during fiscal 2025 and 2024 and there were no transfers in or out of our Level 1 or 2 assets during the same periods.Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisWe report our financial instruments at fair value with the exception of the Senior Notes and Term Loan. See “Note 8. Debt and Revolving Credit Facility.” The estimated fair value of the Senior Notes was determined based on the trading price of the notes as of the last day of trading for the period. We consider the fair value of these notes to be a Level 2 measurement as they are not traded in active markets.The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Senior Notes and Term Debt were as follows:48Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)20252024Carrying AmountEstimated Fair ValueCarrying AmountEstimated Fair ValueSenior Notes due 2029$397.0 $373.2 $396.3 $359.6 Term Loan Facility due 2028— — 576.6 577.0 Convertible Senior Notes due 2031437.8 415.7 — — $834.8 $788.9 $972.9 $936.6 Note 7.

IPR&D will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and will not be amortized until the underlying project reaches technological feasibility and commercial production, at which point the IPR&D will be amortized over the estimated useful life. Useful lives for these IPR&D projects are expected to range between 3 to 10 years. In the event the IPR&D is abandoned, the related assets will be written off. The total amortization expense for acquired intangible assets was $114.2 million in fiscal 2025, $81.6 million in fiscal 2024 and $130.4 million in fiscal 2023. This amortization expense was included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as acquired intangibles amortization and cost of revenue.49Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)Expected annual aggregate amortization expense in future fiscal years are as follows:2026$112.5 202762.2 202842.5 202919.4 20309.8 Thereafter9.0 To be determined6.8 Future amortization$262.2 Impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assetsDuring fiscal 2025, we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of $13.8 million related to a license of certain technology we acquired in fiscal 2024. We recorded the impairment charge due to a lack of potential customers, no alternative uses for the acquired technology and no further development or investment planned for this project. The impairment charge was presented as an operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations.During fiscal 2024, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $16.0 million of IPR&D from our December 2021 acquisition of DSP Group, Inc. (“DSPG”). We recorded the impairment charge as a result of a lack of commitment from certain key customers, no anticipated customer migration to the IPR&D technologies acquired from DSPG and no further development or investment planned for this project. The impairment charge was presented as an operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations.Note 8.

The 2031 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (“2031 Indenture”), dated November 19, 2024. The 2031 Notes are unsecured, bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.75% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2025, and mature on December 1, 2031, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased by us.The 2031 Notes are our senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the 2031 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities.50Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)The initial conversion rate of the 2031 Notes is 10.0308 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2031 Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 99.69 per share). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the 2031 Indenture. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change or if we deliver a Redemption Notice, both as defined in the 2031 Indenture, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock as described in the 2031 Indenture for a holder who elects to convert its 2031 Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change or to convert its 2031 Notes called (or deemed called as provided in the 2031 Indenture) for redemption in connection with such Redemption Notice, as the case may be.At any time from, and including, September 2, 2031, the 2031 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the first calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2025, if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the five consecutive business days after any ten consecutive trading day period (such ten consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in which the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2031 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) if we call such 2031 Notes for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events or distributions on our common stock, (as defined in the 2031 Indenture). As of June 2025, none of the conditions allowing holders of the 2031 Notes to convert had been met. On or after September 2, 2031 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2031 Notes, holders of the 2031 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2031 Notes, regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, the 2031 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock based on the conversion rate (as defined in the 2031 Indenture) or any combination thereof, at our election.The 2031 Notes are redeemable, at our option at any time, and from time to time, on or after December 6, 2028. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2031 Notes (subject to the limitation described below), at our option, on or after December 6, 2028 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before December 1, 2031 at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2031 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if (i) the notes are Freely Tradable (as defined in 2031 Indenture) as of the date we send the related redemption notice and all accrued and unpaid additional interest, if any, has been paid in full as of the most recent interest payment date occurring on or before the date we send such notice; and (ii) the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (1) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date we send such redemption notice; and (2) the trading day immediately before the date we send such notice. However, we may not redeem less than all of the outstanding notes unless at least $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes are outstanding and not called for redemption as of the time we send, and after giving effect to, the related redemption notice. In addition, calling any note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. No sinking fund is provided for the 2031 Notes.Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change (as defined in the 2031 Indenture) prior to the maturity date of the 2031 Notes, holders of the 2031 Notes may require us to repurchase their notes for a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the 2031 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (as defined in the 2031 Indenture).2031 Capped CallsIn connection with the issuance of the 2031 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (each, a “2031 Capped Call” and collectively, the “2031 Capped Calls”) with certain financial institutions. The 2031 Capped Calls have an initial strike price of $99.69, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2031 convertible senior notes. The 2031 Capped Calls have an initial cap price of $150.48 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The 2031 Capped Calls are expected to partially offset the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the 2031 convertible senior notes, with such offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The 2031 Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 4.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The 2031 Capped Calls are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including merger events, tender offers and announcement events. For accounting purposes, each 2031 Capped Call is treated as a separate transaction from, and not part of, the terms of the 2031 convertible senior notes. As these 51Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the 2031 Capped Calls are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The 2031 Capped Calls will not be remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification.Contractual interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on the 2031 Notes was $2.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in 2025.Senior NotesIn March 2021, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due June 15, 2029 (“Senior Notes”), which bear interest at a rate of 4.0% payable semi-annually on December 15 and June 15 of each year. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities.The indenture to the Senior Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all, or substantially all, of its assets.The indenture contains customary events of default. An event of default under the indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal and accrued interest on all outstanding Senior Notes.We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount in 2025 and at 100% of the principal amount in 2026 and thereafter.Contractual interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on the Senior Notes was as follows:202520242023Interest expense$16.0 $16.0 $16.0 Amortization of debt issuance costs0.7 0.7 0.6 Total interest expense$16.7 $16.7 $16.6 Term Loan FacilityOn November 19, 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2031 Notes to repay the outstanding balance and accrued interest of our Term Loan Facility, which was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. The consideration used to extinguish the Term Loan Facility, including unamortized debt issuance costs, resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.5 million and is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.Contractual interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs for our Term Loan Facility was as follows:202520242023Interest expense$18.7 $46.1 $36.2 Amortization of debt issuance costs0.4 1.7 1.7 Total interest expense$19.1 $47.8 $37.9 Revolving Credit FacilityWe have $350.0 million available under a revolving credit agreement, as amended (“Revolving Credit Facility”), with a maturity date to be the earlier of (i) November 21, 2029 and (ii) ninety-one (91) days prior to any maturity of the Senior Notes. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility provides a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. As of June 2025 and June 2024, there was no balance outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.52Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, at our election, at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or Adjusted Term SOFR, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. The unused commitment fees on the Revolving Credit Facility were $0.4 million in 2025 and $0.6 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.The Revolving Credit Facility contains various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total net leverage ratio and the consolidated net interest coverage ratio. As of June 2025, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants.MaturitiesAs of the end of fiscal 2025, principal maturities of our Senior Notes and 2031 Notes were as follows:Senior Notes2031 NotesTotal2026 - 2028$— $— $— 2029400.0 — 400.0 2030 and thereafter— 450.0 450.0 $400.0 $450.0 $850.0 Note 9. LeasesWe have operating leases for our headquarters office and research and development facilities. Certain of these leases have renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal 2034, some of which include options to extend the lease for up to seven years. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, we recorded $12.7 million and $11.8 million of operating leases expense, respectively. Our short-term leases are immaterial.Components of leases were as follows:20252024Operating lease right-of-use assets$45.2 $46.8 Operating lease liabilities$12.3 $11.5 Operating lease liabilities, long-term35.8 37.9 Total operating lease liabilities$48.1 $49.4 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:20252024Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows$14.5 $11.2 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets$9.8 $7.4 As of the end of fiscal 2025, the weighted average remaining lease term was 5.73 years and the weighted average discount rate was 5.24%.53Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)As of the end of fiscal 2025, future minimum lease payments for operating lease liabilities were as follows:Fiscal YearOperating Lease Payments 2026$14.0 202710.1 20288.3 20297.4 20303.9 Thereafter11.9 Total future minimum operating lease payments55.6 Less: interest(7.5)Total lease liabilities$48.1 Note 10. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant CustomersFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are maintained with high-quality financial institutions.We believe that the concentration of credit risk in our accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process, relatively short collection terms and the level of credit worthiness of our customers. We extend credit based on an evaluation of a customer’s financial condition and generally do not require collateral. We perform ongoing credit evaluations on our customers and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary based upon payment history and current credit worthiness. We regularly review the allowance for credit losses by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may negatively impact our customers’ ability to pay.At June 2025 and June 2024, three customers comprised a total of 45% and 42% our accounts receivable, respectively.Note 11.

Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We used the “treasury stock” method to determine the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based awards. We used the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of our 2031 Notes.Note 12. Commitments and ContingenciesCommitmentsAs of June 2025, we had commitments of $53.9 million for purchase obligations which include payments for the acquisition of inventories and other goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity. Total future unconditional purchase commitments in future fiscal years were as follows:2026$40.0 20278.4 20285.5 Total$53.9 IndemnificationsIn connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights. We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not, and will not, infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We accrue for liabilities arising from indemnifications when it is both probable that we will incur the loss and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss.We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant.Environmental MattersIn connection with our acquisition of Conexant Systems, LLC (“Conexant”) in fiscal 2018, we agreed to assume certain environmental liabilities, including remediation of environmental impacts at a property formerly owned by Conexant (“Conexant Site”). We continue to incur costs to investigate and remediate the Conexant Site’s environmental impacts. The liabilities are reviewed periodically and, as investigation and remediation activities continue, adjustments are made as necessary. Liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value. We believe that the outcome of this matter should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or operating results.Legal ProceedingsFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims and legal proceedings, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is both probable that we will incur the loss and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss. While we currently believe that resolving claims against us, 55Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future.Note 13. Stockholders’ EquityPreferred StockWe are authorized, subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the authority to establish, from time-to-time, the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions. Our Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. As of the end of fiscal 2025, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.Shares Reserved for Future IssuanceAs of the end of fiscal 2025, shares of common stock reserved for future issuance was as follows:Restricted stock units outstanding2,981,280Market stock units outstanding104,975Performance stock units outstanding191,386Awards available for grant under all share-based compensation plans3,817,922Reserved for future issuance7,095,563Common Stock Repurchase ProgramFrom April 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a series of stock repurchase programs under which we repurchased shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. These historical programs cumulatively authorized the repurchase of up to $2.3 billion of our common stock. The most recent of these programs expired in July 2025. As a result, on August 5, 2025, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $150 million of our common stock. This program does not have an expiration date; however, the Board will periodically review the authorization to assess its continued appropriateness in light of the Company’s capital allocation priorities and market conditions. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are intended to comply with Rule 10b‑18 under the Exchange Act.The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases depend on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities.In fiscal year 2025 and 2023, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock for $128.3 million and 2.0 million shares for $183.5 million, respectively. We did not repurchase any of our common stock in fiscal 2024. All repurchased shares are recorded as treasury stock.Note 14. Share-Based CompensationShare-Based Compensation PlansAs of the end of fiscal 2025, we had the following equity compensation plans under which equity securities were authorized for issuance to our employees and directors:2025 Inducement Equity PlanEffective January 27, 2025, we adopted the 2025 Inducement Equity Plan (“2025 Inducement Plan”) which provides for the issuance of option or appreciation rights, restricted stock units (“RSU”) or dividend equivalents to our employees. Awards granted under the 2025 Inducement Plan will not exceed 1,700,000 shares of common stock. As of June 2025, 693,494 shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2025 Inducement Plan. Equity awards granted under the 2025 Inducement Plan generally vest ratably over two years from the vesting commencement date. 56Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)Amended and Restated 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation PlanOur Synaptics Incorporated Amended and Restated 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (“2019 Incentive Plan”) provides for the grant of equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, cash incentive awards, shares with performance conditions (“PSU”) or market-based conditions (“MSU”) and other stock-based awards. As of June 2025, 2,675,325 shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2019 Incentive Plan. The performance metrics of PSU and MSU awards can be financial performance and/or market-based conditions. Each PSU and MSU award reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on our financial performance and/or market-based conditions. The actual number of shares that an award recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 0% to 300% of the target number of shares granted, depending upon the achievement of the performance target designated by each individual award.Our 2025 Inducement Plan and 2019 Incentive Plan are collectively referred to as “Stock Compensation Plans.”Restricted Stock UnitsRSUs granted generally vest ratably over two to four years from the vesting commencement date.

Under the 2019 ESPP, the offering period extends for up to one year and includes two exercise dates occurring at six-month intervals. Under the terms of our 2019 ESPP, if the fair market value at an exercise date is less than the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period, the current offering period will terminate and a new offering period will commence. As of June 2025, 449,103 shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2019 ESPP Plan.58Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases were as follows:202520242023Shares purchased237,508211,425172,044Weighted average purchase price$58.53 $74.22 $91.88 Cash received$13.9 $15.7 $15.8 Aggregate intrinsic value$2.5 $4.1 $2.8 The fair value of each award granted under our 2019 ESPP was based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Employee Benefit PlansWe provide retirement benefit plans in the United States and certain foreign countries. We have a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (“401k Plan”) for U.S. full-time employees that allows eligible employees to contribute as defined in the 401k Plan and subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. In fiscal 2025, we provided matching funds of 25% of our employees’ contributions, excluding catch-up contributions. The employer matching funds vest immediately. We made matching contributions to the 401k Plan of $1.8 million in fiscal 2025 and $1.9 million in both fiscal 2024 and 2023.Note 16.

Accordingly, the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future U.S. and foreign taxable income. As of the end of fiscal 2025, a valuation allowance of $94.8 million was maintained to reduce the deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryovers in a foreign jurisdiction and all deferred tax assets in California to levels we believe are more likely than not to be realized through future taxable income. The net change in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2025 was an increase of $2.4 million.We consider almost all earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely reinvested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As a result, an immaterial deferred tax liability is associated with unremitted foreign earnings, the remittance of which would not result in a further provision for income taxes. We continue to indefinitely reinvest $200.0 million on certain accumulated earnings and outside basis differences primarily related to our DSPG acquisition. If the undistributed earnings and other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, the associated foreign tax credits would be expected to reduce the U.S. income tax liability associated with the foreign distribution or the otherwise taxable transaction. As of our fiscal 2025, assuming full utilization of the associated foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and outside basis differences would be approximately $46.0 million.As of the end of fiscal 2025, we had federal, California and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $11.3 million, $31.0 million and $87.9 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss can be carried forward indefinitely and the California net operating loss will begin to expire in fiscal 2027, respectively if not utilized. Most of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. Under current tax law, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are available to offset future income or income taxes, if utilized before expiration. However, the use of these carryforwards may be limited by statute or upon the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership.61Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)We had $32.3 million and $69.7 million of federal and state research tax credit carryforwards, respectively, as of the end of fiscal 2025. The federal research tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2029 and the state research tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely.The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, decreased by $1.9 million from $46.5 million in fiscal 2024 to $44.6 million in fiscal 2025. Of this ending balance, $36.6 million will reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations, if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits consisted of the following:202520242023Beginning balance$46.5 $43.7 $29.8 Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to current year tax positions1.9 10.4 13.7 (Decrease)/increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior year tax positions(2.4)(5.3)2.5 Decrease due to effective settlement with tax authorities(0.4)— (1.1)Remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits1.2 (1.0)(0.3)Decrease due to statute expiration(2.2)(1.3)(0.9)Ending balance$44.6 $46.5 $43.7 Accrued interest and penalties increased by $0.6 million in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024 and increased by $0.6 million in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023. Accrued interest and penalties were $4.2 million and $3.6 million as of the end of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our policy is to classify interest and penalties, if any, as components of income tax expense.It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $3.3 million to an increase of $1.9 million. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period.Our major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Israel and the U.K. From fiscal 2017 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions.On July 4, 2025, subsequent to the end of our fiscal year ended June 28, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was signed into law. This legislation includes a permanent extension and modification of certain provisions under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) and contains multiple effective dates. As the enactment occurred subsequent to our fiscal 2025, the impacts of the provisions of the OBBBA are not reflected in our fiscal 2025 financial statements. Certain provisions are effective beginning in fiscal 2026, and we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the new legislation on our future financial statements.Note 17. RevenueThe majority of our revenue is generated from product shipments to our customers.

See “Note 3. Supplemental Financial Statement Information.” During fiscal 2025 and 2024, we recognized $13.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year.Note 18. Segment and Other InformationSegment reportingWe operate in one segment — the development, marketing and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. This determination is based on the management approach, which designates internal information regularly available to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of determination of our reportable segment. Our CODM, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purpose of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.The CODM uses consolidated net income, as reported in our consolidated statements of operations, as the measure of profit or loss to allocate resources and assess performance. Financial forecasts and budget-to-actual results used by the CODM to assess performance and allocate resources, as well as those used for strategic decisions related to headcount and capital expenditures, are also reviewed on a consolidated basis. The CODM considers the impact of the significant segment expenses in the tables below when deciding whether to reinvest profits or pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions.63Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheet as total assets.

Under the Fiscal 2025 Restructuring Plan, we will early terminate office space under operating leases. During fiscal 2025, we recorded restructuring charges of $16.4 million, which were mainly comprised of severance and one-time termination benefits as well as a write-off of property and equipment. We expect the actions under the Fiscal 2025 Restructuring Plan to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2026.Fiscal 2024 Restructuring PlanA restructuring plan was initiated during the first and fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (“Fiscal 2024 Restructuring Plan”) intended to further improve efficiencies in our operational activities, decrease costs and increase profitability. Restructuring charges were mainly comprised of severance and one-time termination benefits. In connection with the Fiscal 2024 65Table of ContentsSYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)Restructuring Plan, we recorded restructuring charges of $0.5 million and $10.5 million during fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURENot applicable.ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESConclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and ProceduresUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of June 28, 2025, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for our company. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 framework).Based on our evaluation under the COSO 2013 framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of June 28, 2025. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and as part of its audit has issued an attestation report, included herein, on our internal control over financial reporting, as of June 28, 2025.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements, errors and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been or will be prevented or detected. Further, internal controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions or through the deterioration of the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.ITEM 9B.
