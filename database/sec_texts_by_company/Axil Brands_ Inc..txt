Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information
This Annual Report on Form 10-K, in particular Part
II Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” contains certain
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking
statements represent our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies concerning future events, including, but not limited to, any
statements regarding our assumptions about financial performance; the continuation of historical trends; the sufficiency of our cash
balances for future liquidity and capital resource needs; the expected impact of changes in accounting policies on our results of operations,
financial condition or cash flows; anticipated problems and our plans for future operations, including expected growth; the economy in
general or the future of the beauty and hair care industry and the hearing protection and ear bud business, all of which are subject
to various risks and uncertainties.
There are a number of factors that could cause our
actual results to differ from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, many of which are outside of our control. They include:
the impact of unstable market and general economic conditions on our business, financial condition and stock price, including inflationary
cost pressures, increased tariffs and other trade restrictions and barriers, interest rate changes, decreased discretionary consumer
spending, supply chain disruptions and constraints, labor shortages, ongoing economic disruption, the possibility of an economic recession
and other macroeconomic factors, geopolitical events and uncertainty, including the effects of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, and conflict
in the Middle East; and other downturns in the business cycle or the economy; our financial performance and liquidity, including our
ability to successfully generate sufficient revenue to support our operations; our expectations regarding our financing arrangements
and our ability to obtain additional capital if and as needed, including potential difficulties of obtaining financing due to market
conditions resulting from geopolitical conditions and other economic factors; risks related to our operations and international markets,
such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates, different regulatory environments, trade barriers and sanctions, exchange controls,
and social and political instability; changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate, including environmental, health and
safety regulations, including those related to sustainability; our ability to protect and defend our intellectual property; continuity
and security of information technology infrastructure and the potential impact of cybersecurity breaches or disruptions to our management
information systems; widespread outages, interruptions or other failures of operational, communication, and other systems; competition;
our ability to retain our management and employees and the potential impact of labor shortages; demands on management resources; availability
and cost of the raw materials we use to manufacture our products, including the impacts of inflationary cost pressures, tariffs, and
ongoing supply chain disruptions and constraints, which have been, and may continue to be, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict,
the conflict in the Middle East and other geopolitical conflicts; additional tax expenses or exposures; product liability claims; the
potential outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, including ongoing litigation, the disposition of which may have an adverse
effect upon our business, financial condition, or results of operations; our ability to engage in acquisitions, investments, partnerships,
strategic alliances or dispositions when desired; global or regional catastrophic events, including the effects of natural disasters,
which may be worsened by the impact of climate change; effectiveness of our marketing strategy, demand for and market acceptance of our
products, as well as our ability to successfully anticipate consumer trends; and to realize anticipated benefits from our efforts to
expand into new geographic markets and product lines and into offline sales; labor relations; the potential impact of sustainability
matters; implementation of environmental remediation matters; our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;
and risks related to our common stock, including our ability to maintain our stock exchange listing.
When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and
other reports, statements, and information we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), in our
press releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, or in oral statements made by or with the approval of an executive
officer, the words or phrases “believes,” “can,” “may,” “will,” “expect,”
“should,” “could,” “would,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“likely,” “estimate,” “project,” “propose,” “plan,” “design,”
“potential,” “focus” or similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify such forward-looking
statements. However, any statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed
to be forward-looking statements. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form
10-K. We caution that these statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control, and
actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of important factors. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees
of our future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We do not assume
the obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required by applicable law. You should carefully evaluate such statements
in light of factors described in this annual report.

PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
AXIL is engaged in the manufacturing, marketing,
sale, and distribution of innovative hearing and audio enhancement and protection products, as well as professional-grade hair and
skin care products under various trademarks and brands. Previously, on June 16, 2022, the Company acquired substantially all of the
assets of Axil & Associated Brands Corp. (“A&A”), a leader in hearing and audio enhancement and protection,
which marked our initial entry into the hearing technology market. On February 14, 2024, the Company changed its name from
“Reviv3 Procare Company” to “AXIL Brands, Inc.” to better reflect the breadth of our operations. On May 5,
2025, the Company incorporated a new wholly owned subsidiary, Sharper Vision Marketing Inc., which will offer marketing services, in
an effort to capitalize on its internal marketing expertise and convert a historical cost center into a strategic advantage.
The Company is not, and has never been, a shell company.
AXIL operates on a fiscal year ending May 31.
Our Segments
Following the A&A acquisition, we conduct our
business primarily through two operating segments: hearing enhancement and protection, and hair and skin care. See Note 13 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements in this report for financial information for these segments. We concentrate on attracting new customers and retaining
existing customers to increase our total revenue. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, the hearing enhancement and protection segment
and the hair and skin care segment accounted for approximately 94% and 6% of our revenue, respectively. Our newly incorporated subsidiary
established on May 5, 2025, relating to marketing services, did not have any material activity for the year ended May 31, 2025.
Our Strategy
The Company's strategy centers on driving growth
by expanding market share within existing channels and developing new ones through both online and traditional platforms. The Company’s
primary focus is optimizing its e-commerce strategies, building sales teams to meet the needs of distribution channels, and enhancing
value through strategic partnerships.
The Company’s innovation strategy continues to prioritize technological
improvements in the hearing enhancement and protection sector. The Company is actively evaluating opportunities to expand into adjacent
verticals that leverage its existing consumer-facing capabilities. As part of this strategy, AXIL established a marketing services subsidiary
on May 5, 2025, to internalize a function that has historically represented a significant operating expense. This move is intended to
allow the Company to both optimize its internal marketing efficiency and explore revenue opportunities by offering these services to third-party
clients. AXIL plans to continue to prioritize investments that strengthen its core hearing protection and personal care businesses while
strategically expanding into service-based revenue streams.
Hearing Enhancement and Protection Segment
AXIL designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes
advanced hearing enhancement and protection products for a wide range of applications and industries. Our product portfolio includes
earplugs, earmuffs, earbuds, and outdoor speakers, many of which incorporate Bluetooth and wireless audio technologies. These products
serve consumers in sporting goods, tactical, industrial, and recreational markets, as well as military, law enforcement, and federal
agencies.
We currently offer 25 products across 46 stock keeping
units (SKUs), with plans to expand the line. Product development is guided by consumer preferences and brand alignment, supported by
third-party design services. Sales are primarily direct-to-consumer through our website (www.goaxil.com), as well as through third-party
e-commerce platforms, dealers, and national retail chains.
Our key offerings include:
·GS Extreme®
– Bluetooth-enabled earbuds for sound enhancement and hearing protection
·XCOR® True
Wireless – Digital earbuds with touch control
·TRACKR™ Blu
– Bluetooth audio earmuffs with advanced sound enhancement and protection
·X-PRO –
Passive ear protection

Table of Contents
AXIL holds three active patents, one patent pending,
and six registered trademarks related to this segment. For additional detail, see “Intellectual Property.” As the segment
grows, we continue to enter new distribution and licensing agreements across target markets, including construction, aviation, agriculture,
forestry, fitness, power sports, target shooting, motorcycling, and live event environments. We currently operate primarily in the U.S.,
with a growing presence in Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia and Africa.
The Company is growing the business as it continues
to enter into new distribution and licensing agreements. There is focus on public safety and security markets, as well as entertainment
venues. Sales are primarily driven by paid advertising, the expansion of our distribution network, and strategic partnerships, with continued
growth expected, including in offline sales. The Company continues to expand our marketing footprint in organic social, affiliate, and
search engine optimization. The Company has increased its focus on opportunities in domestic and international distribution and retail
sales and is allocating resources to expand its sales team, based on capital performance and available opportunities.
Hearing Enhancement and Protection Competition:
The hearing enhancement and protection products are
in a distinct market that overlaps between the consumer electronics and the hearing protection device sectors. We believe the global
hearing protection devices market is growing due to the greater awareness of hearing loss. According to the Center for Disease Control
and Prevention, 53% of noise-exposed workers report not wearing hearing protection. Demand for innovative products for hearing protection
is rising as consumers seek devices that are both comfortable and offer superior hearing protection.
The hearing protection and enhancement segment competes
with ISOtunes, Walker’s, SureFire, Sordin and others. Many of our competitors in this market have more broadly diversified product
lines, well established supply and distribution systems, loyal customer bases and significant financial, marketing, research and development,
and other resources. We believe our principal competitive advantages include: brand recognition; product technology and innovation; product
quality and safety; price; breadth of product lines; network of technology and content partners; access to third party retailers; sales
channels, distributors, retailers and OEM partners; and patent protection.
Hair and Skin Care Segment
AXIL’s hair and skin care segment involves
the outsourced manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of professional-grade products under the Reviv3 Procare® brand. We currently
offer eight products across sixteen SKUs, with plans to expand the line in response to evolving customer needs. Our manufacturing is
fulfilled through third-party co-packers and partners.
The product line includes shampoos, conditioners,
scalp treatments, styling aids, and skin health solutions designed to promote healthy hair follicles and scalp function. Products are
formulated to work as a system or individually, and include solutions for cleansing, conditioning, repair, protection, and volume enhancement.
Sales are driven by a multi-channel strategy including:
·Direct-to-consumer
via our e-commerce site and third-party platforms
·Domestic
and international distributors
·Professional
salon partnerships
We currently maintain 12 exclusive distribution agreements
across the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia, and hold one registered trademark in this segment. In addition to expanding core distribution,
we are actively exploring growth through co-branding, private-label partnerships, and enhanced digital marketing initiatives.
Hair and Skin Care Competition:
According to Fortune Business Insights, the global
hair care market is projected to reach approximately $113.9 billion in 2025 to $213.5 billion by 2032, reflecting continued
demand driven by consumer interest in premium, clean, and specialized products. In the United States alone, the hair care market is expected
to reach $17.3 billion in 2025 to $20.6 billion in 2030, according to Mordor Intelligence.
The hair and skin care segment competes with Keranique,
Zenagen, Revita and others. Many of our competitors in this market have more broadly diversified product lines, well established supply
and distribution systems, loyal customer bases and significant financial, marketing, research and development and other resources. We
believe our principal competitive advantages include product quality, online marketing, and drug-free solutions for healthy scalp and
hair.

Key Customers
For the hearing enhancement and protection segment
which accounted for 94% of consolidated net sales, no customers accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended
May 31, 2025. Approximately 80% of our consolidated net sales were direct-to-consumer via Shopify and Amazon for the fiscal year ended
May 31, 2025.
As is customary in the industry, none of our customers
is under any obligation to continue purchasing products from us in the future.
Key Suppliers
Similar to other specialty retailers, we purchase
a significant portion of our total inventory from a limited number of vendors. During fiscal year 2025, two vendors accounted for 90%
of total purchases in our hearing enhancement and protection segment, with one vendor representing 67% and the other 23%. In our hair
and skin care segment, a single vendor accounted for 79% of total purchases and a second vendor accounted for 19% of total purchases.
The loss of any one or more of these key vendors or our failure to establish and maintain relationships with these and other vendors
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our relationships with our vendors allowed
us to maintain a competitive in-stock position.
Customer Service and Support
Key elements of our customer service approach are
listening to customers, empathizing with their concerns, responding timely to their requests, and following up with them to make sure
any issues have been properly addressed. In order to ensure that sufficient quality of service is provided, we use a customer service
platform that integrates all of our systems to provide complete and timely data and tracks all support tickets and conversations with
customers. Our customer service manager performs regular monthly reviews of performance metrics and reviews processes.
Governmental Regulation
We are subject to a variety of laws, rules and regulations
in numerous jurisdictions within the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa. These laws, rules and regulations cover
several diverse areas including consumer health and safety, and employee health and safety. These U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws
and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and
can be subject to significant change. The compliance costs and operational burdens imposed by these laws and regulations could be significant.
As a result of the often rapidly evolving changes, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these and other laws and regulations
are often uncertain and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current
policies and practices. We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Environmental Matters: We believe that we
are in compliance with applicable foreign, federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations relating to the protection of the environment,
and that continued compliance will not have any material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Intellectual Property
We intend to protect our technology by filing patent
applications for the technologies that we consider important to our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and
unpatented know-how to protect our proprietary rights.
We recognize the value of our intellectual property
and have taken, and will continue to take, appropriate measures to safeguard it against misappropriation. There can be no assurance,
however, that such actions will provide meaningful protection from competition. In the absence of intellectual property protection, we
may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy or imitate our products or processes.
While we believe that our patents and other proprietary
rights are important to our business, we also believe that, due to the rapid pace of technological change in the markets we serve, the
successful manufacture and sale of our products also depends upon our engineering, manufacturing, marketing and servicing skills.
It is our practice to require that all of our employees
and third-party product development consultants assign to us all rights to inventions or other discoveries relating to our business that
were made while working for us. In addition, all employees and third-party product development consultants agree not to disclose any
private or confidential information relating to our technology, trade secrets or intellectual property.

Table of Contents
At May 31, 2025, we held three active U.S. patents
and had one pending U.S. patent application covering various aspects of our technology. Our U.S. patents expire at various times beginning
in 2035 and extending through 2038. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, no new U.S. patents were issued to us and no U.S. patents
expired.
We have seven federally registered trademarks for
which we consider to be of material importance to our business. The registrations for these trademarks are in good standing with the U.S.
Patent & Trademark Office. Our trademark registrations must be renewed at various times, and we intend to renew our trademarks, as
necessary, for the foreseeable future.
In addition, we own reviveprocare.com and www.goaxil.com.
As with phone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights to an Internet address. The regulation of domain names in
the United States and in other countries is also subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint
additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we might not be able to maintain
our domain names or obtain comparable domain names, which could harm our business.
Seasonality
While our business is not subject to substantial
seasonal fluctuations, we do experience typical variations in consumer demand around certain holidays and promotional periods. These
fluctuations are consistent with industry norms and do not materially impact our overall operating results.
Human Capital Management
As of May 31, 2025, we had approximately ten full-time
employees, all of whom were employed in the United States and none employed outside the United States. None of our employees are covered
by collective bargaining agreements or work councils. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting,
retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. Overall, we consider our employee
relations to be good and believe our culture to be central to the success of the Company.
Health and Safety: The health and safety
of our employees is of utmost importance to us. We are continuing to enhance our safety program with additional training and internal
risk and hazard assessments. We conduct policy and procedure reviews to ensure compliance with health and safety guidelines and regulatory
requirements. We provide protective gear (e.g., eye protection, masks, and gloves) as required by applicable standards and as appropriate.
Our goal is to achieve a level of work-related injuries as close to zero as possible through continuous investment in our safety program.
Compensation and Benefits: Our compensation
and benefits program is designed to attract and reward individuals who demonstrate the ability and desire to enhance our workplace culture,
support our values, drive our operational and strategic goals, and create long-term value for our stockholders.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.
Investing in our securities involves a high degree
of risk. The following are material factors known to us that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results,
as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,
financial condition, operating results, or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Disclosure of risks should not be interpreted
to imply that the risks have not already materialized, and there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. You
should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form
10-K and our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision.
Risks Related to Our Business and Operations
Our future growth depends on successful execution
of our strategic initiatives and market acceptance of our products. Our ability to grow depends on our ability to execute our growth
strategy, which includes expanding into retail channels and international markets. These initiatives require significant commitments of
management and capital investments and involve operational complexity. Failure to effectively execute our growth strategy could result
in missed opportunities and financial losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results
of operations. In addition, if our existing or new products fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, we may be unable to remain
competitive and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.
Risks Related to Our Supply Chain and Cost Structure
We are subject to inflationary pressures and
supply chain risks. Increases in raw material costs, transportation delays, or disruptions in supplier relationships could increase
expenses or limit our ability to deliver products on time. Any inability to source sufficient raw materials for our business in a timely
and cost-effective manner, or at all, could significantly impair our ability to fulfill customer orders and sell our products, which could
negatively impact margins and customer satisfaction.
Inaccurate forecasting may lead to excess inventory
or stockouts. To ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders sufficiently in advance with
our suppliers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. Our ability to meet customer demand depends on accurate
sales forecasting, which could be affected by many factors, including changes in consumer preferences for our and our competitors’
products. If we overestimate demand, we may carry obsolete or excess inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs or write-offs.
If we underestimate demand, we may miss sales opportunities and have unfulfilled orders, which could negatively impact our customer relationships
and result in lost revenues.
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for
certain key components and raw materials. Our ability to manufacture and deliver products depends on a small number of third-party
suppliers, some of whom provide proprietary or difficult-to-substitute materials. Any disruption, delay, capacity constraint, or deterioration
in the financial condition of these suppliers could adversely impact our operations. We may not be able to quickly secure alternative
sources for key components and raw materials on commercially reasonable terms, which could lead to production delays, increased costs,
or inability to meet customer demand.
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters
Our business and the products we sell are subject
to complex and evolving regulations. We are required to comply with various laws and regulations at the local, regional, state, federal,
and international levels. These laws and regulations change frequently, and such changes can impose significant costs and other burdens
of compliance on our business. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new legislation
that affects employment/labor, trade, product safety, transportation/logistics, energy costs, health care, tax, environmental issues,
including the impact of climate change, or compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, among other things, could have an adverse impact
on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in enforcement priorities by governmental agencies charged
with enforcing existing laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business. Furthermore, our products are regulated by various
U.S. and international authorities. As a result, our products could be subject to recalls and other remedial actions. Product safety,
labeling, and licensing concerns may result in us voluntarily removing selected products from our inventory. Recalls or the voluntary
removal of our products can result in lost sales, potential harm to our reputation, increased customer service costs, and legal expenses.
In addition, changes in labeling, safety, or marketing laws may increase compliance costs or limit our ability to sell certain products.
Non-compliance with any of these laws could result in fines, product recalls, or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Changes in U.S. and international trade policies,
including tariffs and import rules, could increase our costs and disrupt operations. We source a significant portion of our products
and components from international suppliers, and we sell our products in a number of countries. U.S. and international trade policy is
subject to ongoing changes, including adjustments to tariff rates, enforcement practices, and import rules and regulations. For example
beginning August 29, 2025, all inbound shipments, regardless of value, may be subject to tariffs, duties, and customs processing fees.
These changes could result in higher landed costs for our products, increased administrative burden, and potential supply chain delays.
If we are unable to offset these cost increases or pass them on to customers, our margins and financial results could be materially adversely
impacted.
We may not be able to maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting. As a public company, we are required to design, implement, and maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, including ongoing evaluation, remediation of deficiencies, and
adaptation to changes in our operations, systems, and regulations. We regularly assess risks, monitor controls, and implement enhancements
to help ensure the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting; however, we cannot guarantee that our controls will prevent or
detect all errors or noncompliance. Failure to maintain effective controls could result in material misstatements, financial restatements,
regulatory scrutiny, increased costs, and loss of investor confidence.
Risks Related to Our Capital and Securities
We may need additional capital, which may not
be available or may dilute existing stockholders. To support our operations or strategic plans, we may need to raise capital through
equity or debt financings. There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all.
If we cannot secure funding on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be forced to delay growth initiatives, which could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If additional funding is raised through the issuance of equity
or convertible securities, holders of our common stock could suffer significant dilution, and any new shares we issue could have rights,
preferences, and privileges superior to those of our common stock.
The issuance of convertible securities may
dilute our common stockholders. We have previously issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in connection with acquisitions. Conversions
of these preferred shares into common stock, or the issuance shares in connection with other convertible securities that we may issue
in the future, could significantly dilute common stockholders and negatively affect the market price of our common stock.
Our common stock price may be volatile and
as a result may not be attractive to investors. Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile due to a variety of factors,
many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:
·our actual or anticipated financial performance;
·changes in the supply or demand of our products;
·our ability to execute our growth strategy;
·speculation about our business in the press or investor community;
·the degree of trading liquidity in our common stock, including our ability to remain listed on the NYSE
American;
·stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies, and in particular, companies
that are in our industry;
·investor perceptions of our industry or our prospects;
·macroeconomic trends and conditions;
·announcements by us or our competitors of new product offerings, significant acquisitions, or strategic
partnerships; or
·additions and departures of key personnel.
In addition, the stock market may experience significant
price and volume fluctuations, which may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies but could cause declines in
the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to
do with our Company or its performance.

Risks Related to Technology and Cybersecurity
A failure of our IT systems or a cybersecurity
breach could disrupt our business. We rely on IT infrastructure, including hardware, networks, software, digital platforms and third-party
systems to operate our business and communicate with customers. These uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breaches,
system disruption, theft, and inadvertent release of information. We have implemented measures to prevent and mitigate cybersecurity breaches.
To date, we are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on
our operations. However, we or our third-party service providers may experience cybersecurity incidents in the future. There can be no
assurance that our operations will not be materially adversely impacted by future cybersecurity incidents, and there is a risk that we
may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cybersecurity breaches. A significant IT failure,
data breach, or cyberattack could harm our reputation, disrupt operations, and expose us to legal or regulatory liabilities. In addition,
the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, release of sensitive or confidential information, or interference with the IT infrastructures
of third parties on which we rely, including suppliers and customers, could result in a disruption to our supply chain, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We also incur costs in order to comply with cybersecurity or data
privacy regulations or with requirements imposed by business partners. Data privacy and cybersecurity laws in the United States and internationally
are constantly changing, and the implementation of these laws has become more complex. Any security breach, whether successful or not,
would harm our reputation and could damage our competitive position and cause the loss of customers. In addition, any such breach, or
any material failure on our part to comply with applicable laws, could subject us to litigation, government investigation or enforcement
actions or other regulatory sanctions, regulatory penalties or fines, or costly response measures.
Risks Related to Macroeconomic and External Conditions
Economic downturns or shifts in consumer behavior
may reduce consumer demand for our products. Unfavorable economic factors that are beyond our control, including those impacting discretionary
spending, may reduce consumer demand for our products. These factors include, but are not limited to, economic uncertainty, including
potential recession, inflation, tariffs, supply chain disruptions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and changing tax rates
and policies. Any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect consumer spending and preferences. If consumer demand for
our products decreases, our revenue and profitability may be materially and adversely impacted.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.
Not applicable.
ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY.
Cybersecurity is an important part of our Enterprise
Risk Management (“ERM”) program, and the Company seeks to address cybersecurity risks through a comprehensive, cross-functional
approach. The Company’s cybersecurity policies, standards, processes, and practices for assessing, identifying and managing material
risks from cybersecurity threats and responding to cybersecurity incidents are continuously analyzed and updated. The Company has established
controls and procedures, including an Incident Response Plan, that provide for the identification, notification, escalation, communication,
and remediation of data security incidents at appropriate levels so that so that decisions regarding the public disclosure and reporting
of such incidents can be made by management in a timely manner. As part of its cybersecurity program, the Company utilizes firewalls,
anti-malware, intrusion prevention and detection systems, and access controls. The Company periodically assesses and tests its policies,
standards, processes and practices that are designed to address cybersecurity threats and incidents, reports results of such assessments
to the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), and periodically makes adjustments to the Company’s cybersecurity
program based on these exercises. The Company engages third parties to conduct such testing. The Company seeks to identify and oversee
cybersecurity risks presented by third parties and their systems from a risk-based perspective by implementing a comprehensive risk assessment
framework, conducting regular audits, and establishing stringent security protocols and standards for third-party engagements. This approach
ensures that potential vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated, thereby protecting the Company’s assets and maintaining robust
security throughout its supply chain. The Company also conducts cybersecurity training for employees (including mandatory training programs
for system users).
Our executive management team is responsible for
assessing and managing risks from cybersecurity threats to the Company. In addition, in light of the pervasive and increasing threat
from cyberattacks, the Board and the Audit Committee, with input from management, assesses the Company’s cybersecurity threats
and the measures implemented by the Company in an effort to mitigate and prevent cyberattacks. The Audit Committee consults with management
regarding ongoing cybersecurity initiatives, and requests management to report to the full Board regularly on their assessment of the
Company’s cybersecurity program and risks. Both the Audit Committee and the full Board receive regular quarterly reports from management
on cybersecurity risks and timely reports regarding any significant cybersecurity incident, as well as ongoing updates regarding any
such incident until it has been addressed.

While the Company faces a number of cybersecurity
risks in connection with its business, as of the date of this report, the Company is not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats
that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including its business strategy, results of
operations, or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance that the Company, or its third-party service providers, will not
experience a cybersecurity threat or incident in the future that could materially adversely affect the Company, including its business
strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
We lease approximately 2,793 rentable square feet
of office space at 9150 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 245, Beverly Hills, California 90212, serving as our principal offices. The lease commenced
on November 1, 2024, and expires on January 31, 2029. Monthly base rent is $11,168 for the first 12 months, with scheduled increases
thereafter. Rent is abated in months 2, 15, and 30. We believe this office space is in good condition and adequately supports our administrative
and corporate functions.
We also lease approximately 6,050 square feet of
office and warehouse space at 777 S. Auto Mall Drive, Unit 107, American Fork, Utah 84003, under a sublease agreement that began on October
1, 2024, and continues through September 30, 2027. Base rent is $7,684 per month for the first 12 months, with escalations thereafter.
Rent is abated for three months in the first year. Additional estimated monthly charges of $1,210 are assessed for common area maintenance,
taxes, and insurance. This facility supports operations for our two primary segments.
We believe that these facilities are in good condition, adequately maintained, and suitable to meet our current business needs.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
From time to time, we become involved in various
lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our financial statements. In evaluating matters for accrual
and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar nature, the specific
facts and circumstances asserted, the likelihood of our prevailing, the availability of insurance, and the severity of any potential
loss. We reevaluate and update accruals as matters progress over time. These legal accruals may be increased or decreased to reflect
any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, we do not record
an accrual, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. In the opinion of management, while the outcome of such claims and disputes
cannot be predicted with certainty, our ultimate liability in connection with these matters is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, and the amounts accrued for any individual matter are not material.
However, legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that any expense, liability, or damages that may ultimately
result from the resolution of these matters will be covered by our insurance or will not be in excess of amounts recognized or provided
by insurance coverage. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of
operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.

Overview
The Company is engaged in the manufacturing, marketing,
sale and distribution of high-tech, innovative hearing and audio enhancement and protection products that provide cutting-edge solutions
for people with varied applications across many industries and professional quality hair and skin care products under various trademarks
and brands.
We have two reportable segments: hair and skin care,
and hearing enhancement and protection. In addition, we have recently incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary with the intent to offer
marketing services. This new subsidiary is expected to support third-party clients by leveraging our direct-to-consumer expertise to
deliver performance-driven marketing solutions.
Through our hearing enhancement and protection segment,
we design, innovate, engineer, manufacture, market and service specialized systems in hearing enhancement, hearing protection, wireless
audio, and communication. Through our hair and skin care segment, we manufacture, market, sell, and distribute professional quality hair
and skin care products.
-9-
Table of Contents
Our overall business strategy is to establish market
awareness of our products through our direct-to-consumer campaigns. Our strategy centers on driving growth by expanding market share
within existing channels and developing new ones through both online and traditional platforms. Our primary focus is optimizing our e-commerce
strategies, building sales teams to meet the needs of distribution channels, and enhancing value through strategic partnerships. The
Company is also working to expand its offline retail presence and enter into new international markets. We believe the increase in awareness
will allow us to increase distribution and gain customers through our distribution partners’ retail establishments, with the goal
of helping us achieve growth in market share and diversify our sales channels; however, we cannot provide any assurances that such increases
will occur, or that we will realize the anticipated benefits of our actions.
Business Update
The Company entered into a strategic supply arrangement
with a national membership-based retail chain, marking a significant milestone in our wholesale channel expansion strategy. Under this
agreement, the retailer placed a substantial initial purchase order that is expected to be fulfilled across the first and early second
quarter of fiscal 2026. While there can be no assurances that additional purchase orders will be placed or as to the timing of the fulfillment
of any orders, this development is anticipated to drive meaningful revenue growth and enhance brand visibility across a broader customer
base.
In June 2025, the Company expanded its leadership
team by hiring a senior contractor to lead growth initiatives in our hair and skin care division. This individual brings extensive experience
in brand development and channel expansion. His appointment reflects our commitment to scaling this business segment and capitalizing
on emerging industry growth.
In May 2025, we received prominent media recognition
in leading military publications—including Military Times, Air Force Times, Marine Corps Times, and Navy Times—highlighting
our advanced hearing protection and enhancement technology and elevating brand credibility among professional and tactical audiences.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company
experienced a temporary disruption in operations as a result of newly imposed international tariffs that affected our supply chain. While
these external factors led to an increase in cost of goods sold and contributed to softer-than-expected sales during the quarter, management
implemented a series of internal operational efficiencies that successfully mitigated the broader financial impact.
We continue to make steady progress on our supply
chain transition strategy, which is intended to build a more resilient and responsive supply chain, in response to elevated U.S. tariffs
and broader geopolitical risks. Key operational milestones are being met as planned, including the ongoing relocation of senior manufacturing
leadership to the United States and early-stage development of domestic production capabilities. We believe these initiatives will position
us well to navigate the evolving trade environment and support long-term competitiveness. We remain focused on execution and expect to
provide additional updates as key phases of our domestic manufacturing build-out progress are completed.
While we continue to experience near-term cost
pressure related to imported components, our mitigation strategies — including selective sourcing adjustments and pricing initiatives
— remain on track. We believe the majority of the tariff-related impact was concentrated in the fourth quarter, and we do not expect
a material ongoing effect into fiscal 2026 based on the tariffs currently in place. If tariff rates change or other changes in trade policy
are implemented, the expected impact on our operations could change.
On July 4, 2025, legislation commonly referred to
as The One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 (the “OBBBA”) was enacted in the U.S. The OBBBA makes permanent the extension of
certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that were set to expire at the end of 2025. Additionally, the OBBBA makes changes to
certain U.S. corporate tax provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others
implemented through 2027. We are currently assessing the impact of the OBBBA on our consolidated financial statements.

We calculate EBITDA by taking net income calculated
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), and adjusting for income taxes,
interest income or expense, and depreciation and amortization. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, further adjusted for stock-based
compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is also presented as a percentage of revenue, which is calculated by dividing the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA
for a period by revenue for the same period. Other companies may calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness
of these measures for comparative purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information regarding
certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations, and management considers EBITDA
and adjusted EBITDA important indicators in evaluating our business on a consistent basis across various periods for trend analyses.
These non-GAAP financial measures exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements
and are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded
or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial
measures to the comparable GAAP financial measure included below. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate
our business.

Net sales for the year ended May 31, 2025
decreased by $1,241,017 or 4.5%, as compared to the year ended May 31, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to reduced advertising
expenditure, which adversely affected direct to consumer sales, partially offset by an increase in sales through our distribution
channels. The net effect in the reduction of advertising expense was a positive impact to operating income. Additionally, the
year-over-year decline in revenue during the fourth quarter was partially attributable to a temporary disruption in operations
related to international tariff changes, which impacted product availability and timing of sales.
-11-
Table of Contents
Cost of sales includes primarily the cost of products,
freight-in costs, and depreciation related to fixed assets that are used in the production and distribution process to bring goods to
their saleable condition and location. For the year ended May 31, 2025, the overall cost of sales increased by $294,116 or 4.0%, as compared
to the year ended May 31, 2024. Cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended May 31, 2025 was 29.0% as compared to
26.6% for the year ended May 31, 2024. The increase in cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, was primarily attributable to an increase
in sales to distributors in both our hair and skin care products and our hearing enhancement and protection segments, bearing lower margins
in addition to elevated input and logistics costs resulting from tariff-related supply chain disruption in the fourth quarter.
Gross profit decreased by $1,535,133 or 7.6% from
$20,176,701 in the year ended May 31, 2024 to $18,641,568 for the year ended May 31, 2025. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for
the year ended May 31, 2025 was 71.0%, as compared to 73.4% for the year ended May 31, 2024. The decrease in the gross profit margin
for year ended May 31, 2025 was primarily attributable to an increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue, and an increase in
discounts as a percentage of revenue.
Operating expenses consisted of marketing and selling
expenses, compensation and related taxes, professional and consulting fees, and general and administrative costs. Operating expenses
decreased by $1,193,118 or 6.4% from $18,673,321 in the year ended May 31, 2024 to $17,480,203 in the year ended May 31, 2025. Operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended May 31, 2025 was 66.6% compared to 67.9% for the year ended May 31, 2024.
Included in operating expenses were non-cash stock-based compensation of $1,108,934 and $267,183 in the years ended May 31, 2025 and
May 31, 2024, respectively. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a net decrease in advertising expenses, and a forgiveness
of accounts payable amounting to approximately $220,000 partially offset by an increase of stock-based compensation of $841,751. Furthermore,
professional and consulting fees decreased in the fourth quarter of 2025 as management implemented cost optimization measures in response
to changes in U.S. trade policy as part of the Company’s efforts to mitigate potential adverse impacts and enhance operational
resilience.
Income from operations for the year ended May 31,
2025, was $1,161,365 compared to income of $1,503,380 for the year ended May 31, 2024. The decrease in income from operations of $342,015
or 22.8% was primarily related to an increase in stock-based compensation expense partially offset by significantly lower advertising
costs, along with a non-recurring gain from the forgiveness of approximately $220,000 in accounts payable.
For the year ended May 31, 2025, provision for income
tax expense was $453,828. For the year ended May 31, 2024, we had an income tax benefit of $220,205.
As a result of the above, we reported a net income
of $854,988 and $2,003,134 for the years ended May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA increased by $427,444 or 21.3% from
$2,002,889 for the year ended May 31, 2024 to $2,430,333 for the year ended May 31, 2025. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales, net
for the years ended May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024, was 9.3% and 7.3%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to a substantial
reduction in advertising expense, which outweighed the associated decline in revenue, and was further supported by a one-time gain from
the forgiveness of approximately $220,000 in accounts payable.
Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year
ended May 31, 2025 were approximately $0.13 and $0.10, respectively, compared to $0.57 and $0.21 in the prior years. The prior-year EPS
included a one-time gain of $1,329,588 related to preferred stock redemption; excluding that non-recurring benefit, the year-over-year
decline in EPS was more moderate and corresponds to the lower net income in full year ended May 31, 2025.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We are currently engaged in product sales and development.
Although we earned net income and have cash provided by operations in the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, we have experienced
operating losses in prior periods. We expect to continue generating net income and positive cash flow in the fiscal year ending May 31,
2026. Based on our current cash balances and anticipated operating cash flows, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet working
capital needs for at least one year from the issuance date of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
We plan to manage expenses relative to expected revenue
and may reinvest near-term cash to support revenue growth. Following the acquisition of A&A’s assets in June 2022, we have
generated sufficient cash to support our operations and required debt payments, and we expect this to continue, although we cannot provide
any assurance. Management remains focused on expanding product lines and our customer base to drive revenue. However, future cash demands
may exceed historical levels. If needed, we may seek additional capital, although there is no assurance that financing will be available
on acceptable terms or at all. Subject to these uncertainties, we believe we have sufficient capital and liquidity to fund operations
for at least one year from the issuance date of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In fiscal year 2025, we entered into two new operating
lease agreements: one for a corporate office in Beverly Hills, California, and another for a warehouse facility in American Fork, Utah.
These leases began in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and are scheduled to run through January 2029 and September 2027, respectively.
The total initial lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset recognized was approximately $767,000. As of May 31, 2025, the
total lease liability was approximately $617,000, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 3.3 years and a discount rate of 13.1%.
Lease costs totaled approximately $193,000 in fiscal 2025 and are recorded in general and administrative expenses. Future lease payments
are expected to be funded through operating cash flows. We believe our current liquidity is sufficient to meet these obligations.

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities for the
year ended May 31, 2025, was $1,928,661, compared to $2,677 for the year ended May 31, 2024. This improvement primarily resulted from
our strategic decision to increase inventory levels as of May 31, 2024 to accommodate new product variations and packaging aimed at expanding
into new markets. Inventory sold during the year ended May 31, 2025 contributed positively to cash flows. Additionally, cash flow improved
due to the substantial decrease in advertising expense which had an immediate impact on cash flows, and a forgiveness of accounts payable
during the year ended May 31, 2025, resulting in an improvement of operating cash flows of approximately $220,000, partially offset by
timing of net changes in operating assets and liabilities excluding inventory.
Investing Activities
Net cash flows used in investing activities for the
year ended May 31, 2025 was $394,298 due to the purchase of intangibles relating to increased product testing and property and equipment
for the Company’s business. For the year ended May 31, 2024, net cash flows used in investing activities were $160,525, primarily
attributable to the cash used in the purchase of property and equipment primarily relating to our expansion into new product lines.

Table of Contents
Financing Activities
Net cash flows used in financing activities for the
year ended May 31, 2025 was $18,385 compared to $1,420,958 used in financing activities for the year ended May 31, 2024. The decrease
in financing activities related primarily to repurchases of preferred stock amounting to $1,246,490 in the year ended May 31, 2024 that
did not occur in the year ended May 31, 2025.
As of May 31, 2025, we had a secured Economic Injury
Disaster Loan outstanding, administered pursuant to the CARES Act in the principal amount of $140,229, with a maturity date of May 18,
2050. The Company continues to pay interest and principal on the loan.
We are dependent on our product sales to fund our
operations and may require additional capital in the future, such as pursuant to the sale of additional common stock, preferred stock,
debt securities or entering into credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements with institutions or private individuals, to maintain
operations, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, and could require us to sell certain assets or discontinue or curtail
our operations. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult
to obtain, more costly and more dilutive. Our officers and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source
of liquidity in the form of cash advances, loans, and/or financial guarantees. We do not have any plans to seek additional financing
at this time and anticipate that our existing cash equivalents and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our working
capital requirements. However, if the need arises for additional cash, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital
we need for our operations on favorable terms, or at all. We may not be able to obtain additional capital or generate sufficient revenues
to fund our operations. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse
effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon our business plans. If
we are unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds, for whatever reason, to fund our operations, we may be forced to cease operations. If
we fail to raise funds, we expect that we will be required to seek protection from creditors under applicable bankruptcy laws.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of May 31, 2025, we did not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results or operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Critical accounting policies and practices are
those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results, and require management’s
most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are
inherently uncertain. The critical accounting policies and practices used by the Company for the year ended May 31, 2025 financial statements
relate to the policies and practices the Company uses to account for:
Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful
accounts
The Company has a policy of providing an allowance
for doubtful accounts based on its best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company
periodically reviews its accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts
and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are
charged to bad debt expense and included in the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery
is considered remote.

Table of Contents
Revenue recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer, typically
upon shipment. In determining the transaction price, we consider discounts, promotional incentives, and expected returns. These estimates
require judgment based on historical experience and current market conditions. Changes in customer behavior or promotional strategies
could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration
paid over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually during
the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances or events suggest potential impairment. Throughout the year, we monitor for indicators
that might trigger an interim impairment review. Our testing may begin with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. If a quantitative test is performed, fair value is
estimated based on the amount a market participant would pay in a hypothetical sale of the reporting unit. When the fair value exceeds
the carrying value, goodwill is considered to be not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge is recorded
for the amount of the excess, limited to the total carrying amount of goodwill.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,”
as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer (“CEO”) and Principal Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Principal Financial
and Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We conducted an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of May 31, 2025. Based on this evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of May 31, 2025, our CEO and CFO
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f).
Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management, including our CEO and CFO, assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025 using criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued in 2013. Based on the assessment,
our management has concluded that as of May 31, 2025, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
This annual report does not include an attestation
report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not
subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s
report in this annual report.
Changes in Internal Controls
There has been no change in our internal control
over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act
that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2025 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect
our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS,
AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.
Director Independence
We are subject to the corporate governance requirements
of the NYSE American and apply the rules of the SEC and the NYSE American to evaluate the independence of our directors. The Board has
determined that, of the five Board members, each of Mr. Dunne, Ms. Hundt, and Mr. Ohri qualifies as independent under the NYSE American
listing standards. Accordingly, our Board is currently comprised of a majority of directors who qualify as independent directors under
the rules adopted by the SEC and NYSE American, and all Board committee members are independent for the purposes of the committees on
which they serve. In making such independence determinations, our Board considered the relationships that each non-employee director
has with us and all other facts and circumstances that our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence.
Related Party Transactions
The following is a description of transactions or
series of transactions since June 1, 2023, to which we were or will be a party, in which:
·
the amount involved in the transaction exceeds the lesser of (i) $120,000 or (ii) 1% of the average of our total assets at year

·
in which any of our executive officers, directors, director nominees or holders of 5% or more of any class of our voting capital
stock, or any immediate family member of any of the foregoing, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.
The Company reviews and approves all related party
transactions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of:
AXIL Brands, Inc.
Opinion on
the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of AXIL Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements
of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended May 31, 2025, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, and
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended May 31, 2025, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for
Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
The critical audit matters are matters arising from
the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee
and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

AXIL BRANDS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES  TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MAY 31, 2025 AND 2024
Note 1 – Organization
As part of AXIL Brands, Inc.’s (together with
its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) ongoing rebranding efforts, the
Company changed its name from Reviv3 Procare Company to AXIL Brands, Inc. effective February 14, 2024. Reviv3 was incorporated in the
State of Delaware on May 21, 2015 as a reorganization of Reviv3 Procare, LLC which was organized on July 31, 2013. The Company’s
corporate headquarters are located at 9150 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 245, Beverly Hills, California 90212. Its phone number is (888)
638-8883. In March 2022, the Company incorporated a subsidiary “Reviv3 Acquisition Corporation” (now known as “AXIL
Distribution Company”) and in June 2022, completed the acquisition of certain assets of Axil & Associated Brands Corp. (“A&A”).
In addition, on May 5, 2025, the Company incorporated a new wholly owned subsidiary, Sharper Vision Marketing Inc., which did not have
any material activity for the year ended May 31, 2025.
The Company is engaged in the manufacturing, marketing,
sale and distribution of high-tech hearing and audio enhancement and protection products that provide cutting edge solutions for consumers,
with varied applications across many industries; as well as professional quality hair and skin care products. These product lines are
both sold throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. On February 14, 2024, the Company successfully completed efforts to
uplist from the over-the-counter, or OTC, markets to the NYSE American stock exchange (“NYSE American”).
Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements for the fiscal
years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024 have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
and include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
Reverse Stock Split
Effective as of January 16, 2024, the Company effected
a reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of the Company’s issued shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20,
as approved by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). The Reverse Stock Split did not affect the total number
of shares of common stock that the Company is authorized to issue and any fractional shares remaining after the Reverse Stock Split were
rounded up to the nearest whole share. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements give
retroactive effect to the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented, unless otherwise specified.
Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the
reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates. Estimates made by management include, but are not limited
to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuations and classifications, the useful life of property and equipment, the
valuation of deferred tax assets, the value of stock-based compensation, contract liability, allowance on sales returns, valuation of
lease liabilities and related right of use assets, and the fair value of non-cash common stock issuances.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
year to conform with the current year reporting. For the year ended May 31, 2024, $17,236 was reclassified from General and administrative
expenses to Cost of sales, $16,544 from Compensation and related taxes to General and administrative expenses, and $116,061 from General
and administrative expenses to Professional and consulting expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. These
reclassifications had the effect of decreasing Gross profit by $17,236 and decreasing Operating expenses by $17,236. There was no effect
on operating income or net income. Additionally, in the financing section of the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, Advances from
related party and Repayments to related party are presented on a gross basis.

Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments
and other short-term investments with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains
cash and cash equivalent balances at one financial institution that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. (See Note
12 - Concentrations).
Accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses
Accounts receivables is comprised of receivables
from customers and receivables from merchant processors. The Company has a policy of providing an allowance for credit losses
based on its best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company periodically
reviews its accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors
that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to
provision for credit losses and included in the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered
remote.
Prepaid expenses and other current assets
Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist
primarily of cash prepayments to vendors for inventory and prepayments for trade shows and marketing events which will be utilized within
a year, prepayments on credit cards and the right to recover assets (for the cost of goods sold) associated with the right of returns
for products sold. Prepayments to vendors for inventory was $643,131 and $472,904 as of May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024, respectively.
Inventory
The Company values inventory, consisting of finished
goods and raw materials, at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using an average cost method. The Company
reduces inventory for the diminution of value, resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability, equal
to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value. The Company evaluates its current level of inventory
considering historical sales and other factors and, based on this evaluation, classifies inventory markdowns in the statement of operations
as a component of cost of goods sold. These markdowns are estimates, which could vary significantly from actual requirements if future
economic conditions, customer demand or competition differ from expectations. The Company continuously evaluates the levels of inventory
held and any inventory held above the expected level of sales in the next twelve months, is classified as non-current inventory.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The cost of
repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or
disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed, and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statement of operations.
Product warranty
The Company provides a two-year or three-year limited
warranty on its hearing enhancement and hearing protection products. The Company records the costs of repairs and replacements, as they
are incurred, to the cost of sales.
Revenue recognition
The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers. This revenue recognition standard has a five-step process: a) Determine
whether a contract exists; b) Identify the performance obligations; c) Determine the transaction price; d) Allocate the transaction price;
and e) Recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied.
F-7
Table of Contents
Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
The Company sells a variety of hair and skin care
products and electronic hearing and enhancement products. The Company recognizes revenue for the agreed upon sales price when a purchase
order is received from the customer and subsequently the product is shipped to the customer, which satisfies the performance obligation.
Consideration paid to the customer to promote and sell the Company’s products is typically recorded as a reduction in revenues.
The five steps for revenue recognition are as follows:
Identify the contract with a customer. The
Company generally considers completion of a sales order (which requires customer acceptance of the Company’s click-through
terms and conditions for website sales and authorization of payment through credit card or another form of payment for sales made over
the phone) or purchase orders from non-consumer customers as a customer contract provided that collection is considered probable. For
payments that are not made upfront by credit card, the Company assesses customer creditworthiness based on credit checks, payment history,
and/or other circumstances. For payments involving third party financier payors, the Company validates customer eligibility and reimbursement
amounts prior to shipping the product.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
Product performance obligations include shipment of products and related accessories and service performance obligations include extended
warranty coverage.
However, as the historical redemption rate under
our warranty policy has been low, the option is not accounted for as a separate performance obligation. The Company does not assess whether
promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer.
Determine the transaction price and allocation
to performance obligations. The transaction price in the Company’s customer contracts consists of both fixed and
variable consideration. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration
includes the 30-days and 60-days right of return that applies to the hearing protection and enhancement segment and hair and skin care
segment, respectively. To estimate product returns, the Company analyzes historical return levels, current economic trends, and changes
in customer demand. Based on this information, the Company reserves a percentage of product sale revenue and accounts for the estimated
impact as a reduction in the transaction price.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction
price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis.
Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies
a performance obligation. Revenue for products is recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment. Revenue for services
(extended warranty) is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the warranty period.
As of May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024, contract liabilities
amounted to $963,294 and $1,385,841, respectively.  As of May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024, contract liabilities associated with
unfulfilled performance obligations for warranty services offered for a period of two to three years was $841,771 and $1,251,710, respectively,
and contract liabilities associated with unfulfilled performance obligations for customers’ right of return was $117,560 and $130,201,
respectively. Our contract liabilities related to warranties are expected to be recognized over a period of one year to three years.
Approximately $635,832 is expected to be recognized in year 1, $187,387 is expected to be recognized in year 2, and $18,552 is expected
to be recognized in year 3. Contract liabilities associated with gift cards purchased by customers amounted to $3,963 as of May 31, 2025
and $3,930 as of May 31, 2024.

Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies (continued)
Cost of Sales
The components of cost of sales include the cost
of the product, shipping fees and depreciation of equipment used to bring inventory to its saleable condition.
Shipping and Handling Costs
The Company accounts for shipping and handling fees
in accordance with ASC 606. While amounts charged to customers for shipping products are included in revenues, the related costs of shipping
products to customers are classified in marketing and selling expenses as incurred. Shipping costs included in marketing and selling
expense were $994,743 and $1,163,954 for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Marketing, selling and advertising
Sales, marketing and advertising costs are expensed
as incurred.
Customer Deposits
Customer deposits consisted of prepayments from customers
to the Company. The Company will recognize the prepayments as revenue upon delivery of products in compliance with its revenue recognition
policy.
Fair value measurements and fair value of financial instruments
The Company adopted ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes
a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that requires the use of fair value
measurements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption
of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company’s financial position or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures.
ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date.
Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation
techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:
Level 1:
Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities.
Level 2:
Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
Level 3:
Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting
entity’s own assumptions.
The Company analyzes all financial instruments with
features of both liabilities and equity under the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) accounting standard
for such instruments. Under this standard, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level
of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments,
including prepaid expenses, deposits, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates
their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
Goodwill
Goodwill is comprised of the purchase price of business
combinations in excess of the fair value assigned at acquisition to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill
is not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment for its reporting units on an annual basis, or when events occur, or circumstances
indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value.
F-9
Table of Contents
Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment
assessment on May 31st of each year or as impairment indicators dictate.
When evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill,
management first assesses a range of qualitative factors, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions,
the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company’s products and services, regulatory and political developments,
entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and the overall financial performance for each of the Company’s
reporting units. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying value, we then proceed to the quantitative impairment testing methodology primarily using the income approach
(discounted cash flow method).
Under the quantitative method we compare the
carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined by its estimated discounted cash flows.
If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of impairment to be recognized is the amount by which
the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.
When required, we arrive at our estimates of fair
value using a discounted cash flow methodology which includes estimates of future cash flows to be generated by specifically identified
assets, as well as selecting a discount rate to measure the present value of those anticipated cash flows. Estimating future cash flows
requires significant judgment and includes making assumptions about projected growth rates, industry-specific factors, working capital
requirements, weighted average cost of capital, and current and anticipated operating conditions. The use of different assumptions or
estimates for future cash flows could produce different results.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to
the provision of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“ASC 740-10”), which requires, among other things,
an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax
bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes
it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.
The Company follows the provision of ASC 740-10 related
to Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, there may be uncertainty about the merits of positions
taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of
a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes
it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes,
if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
Tax positions that meet the more likely than not
recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement
with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefit associated with tax positions taken that exceed the amount measured
as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along
with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its
tax positions are all more likely than not to be upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain
tax benefits.
The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25, “Definition
of Settlement”, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the
purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion
and examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity
would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based
solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The federal and state income tax returns
of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS and state taxing authorities, generally for three years after they are filed.

Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Impairment of long-lived assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least
annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying
amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book
value. The Company did not record any impairment loss during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024.
Stock-based compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on
the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718, “Compensation — Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”),
which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award
of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively,
the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award
based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
For non-employee stock option based awards, the Company
follows ASU 2018-7, which substantially aligns share-based compensation for employees and non-employees.
Net income per share of common stock
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing
the net income by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. For the years ended May 31,
2025 and 2024, certain stock options, preferred shares and restricted stock awards were excluded from the computation of diluted common
shares outstanding as they would have an anti-dilutive impact on the Company’s net income.
The dilutive common stock equivalent shares consist
of preferred stock, stock options, and restricted stock awards and were computed under the treasury stock method, using the average market
price during the period.
The following table sets forth the computations of basic and diluted net
income per common share:

Lease Accounting
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 842, Leases, on June 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this standard, the Company is required
to recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for substantially all leases, including those previously classified
as operating leases.
The Company treats a contract as a lease when it
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. For all leases with terms
greater than 12 months, the Company recognizes a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement date. The lease
liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments not yet paid, discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing
rate. The ROU asset is measured as the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs, prepaid rent, or lease incentives.
The Company’s incremental borrowing rate reflects
the rate of interest it would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term and for an asset of similar value.
The implicit rate in the lease is used when it is readily determinable.
ROU assets represent the Company’s right to
use the leased asset over the lease term, while lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments. Lease expense is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments, which depend on factors such as usage or future events, are expensed
as incurred and do not result in remeasurement of the lease liability.
The Company reviews ROU assets for impairment consistent
with the policy for long-lived assets. Recoverability is assessed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value
of the asset may not be recoverable. The review is based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset.
The Company’s lease agreements do not include
residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. The Company does not act as a lessor and does not have any finance leases at this
time.
Segment Reporting
The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 280,
Segment Reporting. Operating segments are defined as components of the business for which discrete financial information is available
and regularly reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to assess performance and allocate
resources. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer serves as the CODM.
The Company has determined that it operates in two
reportable segments: (a) the sale of hearing protection and hearing enhancement products, and (b) the sale of hair and skin care products.
There were no changes to the Company’s reportable segments during the year ended May 31, 2025. A new legal entity was incorporated
during the fiscal year; however, it has not been reported as a separate segment as it had no operations during the reporting period.
The Company also provides disclosures of revenue
and long-lived assets by geographic area in accordance with ASC 280. See Note 13 – “Business Segment and Geographic Area
Information” for additional information.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This guidance requires additional annual and interim disclosures
for reportable segments. This new standard does not affect the recognition, measurement or financial statement presentation. The amendments
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2024. The Company adopted the ASU effective June 1, 2024. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, requiring additional rate-reconciliation categories, annual income
tax payments by jurisdiction, and foreign vs. domestic pre-tax income. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2024. The Company has not early adopted this guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on
its future income tax disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income
Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40), which requires entities to
provide more detailed disaggregation of expenses in the income statement, focusing on the nature of the expenses rather than their function.
The new disclosures will require entities to separately present expenses for significant line items, including but not limited to, depreciation,
amortization, and employee compensation. Entities will also be required to provide a qualitative description of the amounts remaining
in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively, disclose the total amount of selling expenses and,
in annual reporting periods, provide a definition of what constitutes selling expenses. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted.
The Company does not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Other accounting standards that have been issued
or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements
upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

Note 8 – Notes Payable
During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, a commercial
bank granted to the Company a loan (the “Loan”) in the amount of $150,000, which is administered under the authority and
regulations of the U.S. Small Business Administration pursuant to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (the “EIDL”) of
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The Loan, which is evidenced by a note dated May
18, 2020, bears interest at an annual rate of 3.75% and is payable in installments of $731 per month, beginning May 18, 2021
until May 18, 2050. The Company has to maintain a hazard insurance policy including fire, lightning, and extended coverage on all items
used to secure this loan to at least 80% of the insurable value. Proceeds from loans granted under the CARES Act are intended to be used
for payroll, costs to continue employee group health care benefits, rent, utilities, and certain other qualified costs (collectively,
“qualifying expenses”). The Company used the loan proceeds for qualifying expenses. During the fiscal year ended May 31,
2022, the Company received a loan forgiveness for $10,000 and an additional $10,000 of borrowings under the program. The Company recorded

Note 9 – Stockholders’ Equity
Shares Authorized
As of May 31, 2025 and 2024, the authorized capital
of the Company consisted of 15,000,000 and 450,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, respectively, and 28,000,000
and 300,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, respectively.
On April 8, 2025, the Board of Directors approved,
and the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting securities approved by written consent, an amendment to the Company’s
Certificate of Incorporation to reduce the authorized shares of common stock from 450,000,000 to 15,000,000, authorized shares of preferred
stock from 300,000,000 to 28,000,000, and designated shares of Series A Preferred Stock from 250,000,000 to 27,773,500.The par value
and rights of the shares remained unchanged. The amendment became effective upon filing with the Delaware Secretary of State on May 19,
2025.
Effective as of January 16, 2024, the Company effected
the Reverse Stock Split of the Company’s issued shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20, as approved by the Company’s
Board of Directors (the “Board”). The Reverse Stock Split did not change the par value of the common stock, modify any voting
rights or other terms of the common stock. The total number of shares of common stock that the Company is authorized to issue remained
unchanged and any fractional shares remaining after the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements give retroactive effect to the Reverse Stock Split for all periods
presented, unless otherwise specified.
Preferred Stock
The preferred stock may be issued from time to time
in one or more series. The Board is expressly authorized to provide for the issuance of all or any of the shares of the preferred stock
in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares and to determine or alter, for each such series, such voting powers, full or limited,
or no voting powers and such designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other rights and such qualifications,
limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution adopted by the Board providing the issuance
of such shares. The Board is also expressly authorized to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issue
of shares of that series. In case the number of shares of any such series shall be so decreased, the decrease shall resume the status
that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.
During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023, the Company
issued 250,000,000 shares of non-voting Series A Preferred Stock, which, following the Reverse Stock Split of the Company’s common
stock, are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a twenty-to-one ratio. These 250,000,000 shares of non-voting
Series A Preferred Stock were valued at the fair market value of $3,100,000 at issuance.
The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
have no rights to dividends with respect to such shares. No dividends or other distributions shall be declared or paid on the common
stock unless and until dividends at the same rate shall have been paid or declared and set apart upon the Series A Preferred Stock, based
upon the number of shares of common stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock may then be converted. Upon the dissolution, liquidation,
or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive out
of the assets of the Company the sum of $0.0001 per share before any payment or distribution shall be made on our shares of common stock.
The Series A Preferred Stock shall not be subject to redemption at the option, election or request of the Company or any holder or holders
of the Series A Preferred Stock. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible at the option of the holder thereof, into one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock for each 20 shares of Series A Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the holder
may not convert that number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock which would cause the holder to become the beneficial owner of more
than 5% of the Company’s common stock as determined in accordance with Sections 13(d) and (g) of the Exchange Act and the applicable
rules and regulations thereunder.
The conversion provisions of the Company’s
Series A Preferred Stock were proportionately adjusted in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and the number of shares of Series
A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split.

Note 9 – Stockholders’ Equity (continued)
On March 5, 2024, the Company entered into repurchase
agreements with certain stockholders of the Company to purchase in the aggregate 207,748,250 shares of Series A Preferred Stock
of the Company (equivalent, in aggregate, to 10,387,413 shares of the Company’s common stock on an as converted basis) for the
aggregate cash consideration of $1,246,490. Such repurchase was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. Following the repurchase, 42,251,750 shares
of Series A Preferred Stock remained outstanding. The Company recorded a credit of $1,329,588 to the retained earnings, in the fiscal
year 2024, for the difference between the carrying value of the preferred stock repurchased and the cash paid to the stockholders.
During the year ended May 31, 2025, certain stockholders
of 14,478,250 preferred shares converted their preferred stock into 723,913 shares of common stock.
As of May 31, 2025 and 2024, 27,773,500 and
42,251,750 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, respectively.
Effective March 24, 2025, the Company’s
board of directors ratified certain past actions which provided that all shares of preferred stock that were repurchased by the Company
along with those that were converted into shares of common stock would be considered retired. The Company retired 222,226,500 shares
of Series A Preferred Stock that were previously repurchased by the Company or converted into shares of common stock prior to such date.
Common Stock
As of May 31, 2025, 6,657,717 shares of common stock
were issued and outstanding.
See Preferred Stock and Restricted Stock Awards and
Restricted Shares Issued sections within this note for additional information regarding common stock issued during the years May 31,
2025 and 2024.
The Reverse Stock Split (See Note 2), did not change
the par value of the common stock, modify any voting rights or other terms of the common stock, or change the number of authorized shares
of the Company. Any fractional shares remaining after the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share.
Stock Options
Effective February 14, 2024, the Board amended the
Company’s original 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the “Plan”), which was originally approved on March 21,
2022. The effective date of the amended Plan was October 31, 2023. On October 8, 2024, the Board of Directors approved the amendment
and restatement of the Plan in order to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan by 800,000 shares, any or
all of which may be issued pursuant to grants of “incentive stock options” (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code). The amendment and restatement of the Plan became effective December 18, 2024, following shareholder approval.
Under the Plan, equity-based awards may be made to
employees, officers, directors, non-employee directors and consultants of the Company and its Affiliates (as defined in the Plan) in
the form of (i) Incentive Stock Options (to eligible employees only); (ii) Nonqualified Stock Options; (iii) Restricted
Stock; (iv) Stock Awards; (v) Performance Shares; or (vi) any combination of the foregoing. The Plan will terminate upon
the close of business on March 20, 2032, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The Board serves as the
Plan administrator and may amend or terminate the Plan without stockholder approval, subject to certain exceptions.

Note 9 – Stockholders’ Equity (continued)
The total number of shares initially authorized for
issuance under the Plan was 500,000 shares. The Plan has since been amended to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance
under the Plan to 2,050,000 shares of common stock. The Plan provides for an annual increase on April 1 of each calendar year, beginning
in 2022 and ending in 2031, subject to Board approval prior to such date. Such potential increase may be equal to the lesser of (i) 4%
of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on May 31 of the immediately preceding fiscal year and
(ii) such smaller number of shares as determined by the Board. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan will not change
unless the Board affirmatively approves an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance prior to April 1 of the applicable
year. Shares surrendered or withheld to pay the exercise price of a stock option or to satisfy tax withholding requirements will not
be added back to the number of shares available under the Plan. To the extent that any shares of common stock awarded or subject to issuance
or purchase pursuant to awards under the Plan are not delivered or purchased, or are reacquired by the Company, for any reason, including
a forfeiture of restricted stock or failure to earn performance shares, or the termination, expiration or cancellation of a stock option,
or any other termination of an award without payment being made in the form of shares of common stock will be added to the number of
shares available for awards under the Plan. The number of shares available for issuance under the Plan will be adjusted for any increase
or decrease in the number of outstanding shares of common stock resulting from payment of a stock dividend on common stock, a stock split
or subdivision or combination of shares of common stock, or a reorganization or reclassification of common stock, or any other change
in the structure of shares of common stock, as determined by the Board. Shares available for awards under the Plan will consist of authorized
and unissued shares.
Two types of options may be granted under the Plan:
(1) Incentive Stock Options, which may only be issued to eligible employees of the Company and are required to have exercise price of
the option not less than the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date, or, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option
granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder, 110% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date; and (2) Non-qualified
Stock Options, which may be issued to participants under the Plan and which may have an exercise price less than the fair market value
of the common stock on the grant date, but not less than par value of the stock.
The Board may grant or sell restricted stock to participants
(i.e., shares that are subject to a subject to restrictions or limitations as to the participant’s ability to sell, transfer, pledge
or assign such shares) under the Plan. Except for these restrictions and any others imposed by the Board, upon the grant of restricted
stock, the recipient generally will have rights of a stockholder with respect to the restricted stock. During the applicable restriction
period, the recipient may not sell, exchange, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of the restricted stock. The Board may also grant
awards of common stock to participants under the Plan, as well as awards of performance shares, which are awards for which the payout
is subject to achievement of such performance objectives established by the Board. Performance shares may be settled in cash.
Each equity-based award granted under the Plan will
be evidenced by an award agreement that specifies the terms of the award and such additional limitations, terms and conditions as the
Board may determine, consistent with the provisions of the Plan.
Subject to the Plan’s terms, the Board has
full power and authority to determine whether, to what extent and under what circumstances any outstanding award will be terminated,
canceled, forfeited or suspended. Awards that are subject to any restriction or have not been earned or exercised in full by the recipient
will be terminated and canceled if such recipient is terminated for cause, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion.
The Company estimates the fair value of share-based
compensation utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is dependent upon several variables such as the expected option
term, expected volatility of the Company’s stock price over the expected term, expected risk-free interest rate over the expected
option term and expected dividend yield rate over the expected option term. The Company believes this valuation methodology is appropriate
for estimating the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors which are subject to ASC 718 requirements. These amounts
are estimates and thus may not be reflective of actual future results, nor amounts ultimately realized by recipients of these grants.
The Company recognizes compensation on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each award.
The Company utilizes the simplified method to estimate
the expected life for stock options granted to employees. The simplified method was used as the Company does not have sufficient historical
data regarding stock option exercises. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based
on the U.S. Treasury yields with terms equivalent to the expected life of the related option at the time of the grant. Dividend yield
is based on historical trends. While the Company believes these estimates are reasonable, the compensation expense recorded would increase
if the expected life was increased, a higher expected volatility was used, or if the expected dividend yield increased.

Leases
The Company had a lease agreement in connection with
its previous office and warehouse facility in California under an operating lease which expired in October 2019. On December 1, 2019,
the Company signed an extension of the lease for 3 years. The rent was $7,567 per month for the first year and increased by
a certain amount each year. In November 2022, the Company entered into an extension of the lease for a two-year term beginning December
1, 2022. The rent was $6,098 per month for the first year and increased by a certain amount the following year. Upon expiration of the
lease on December 1, 2024, the Company did not renew the lease.
On October 12, 2024, the Company entered into a lease
in Beverly Hills, California for a term beginning November 1, 2024 and ending January 31, 2029. The base rent is $11,168 per month for
the first twelve months and shall increase for each twelve-month period thereafter. The lease provides for rent abatement during months
2, 15, and 30.
On September 10, 2024, the Company entered into a
sublease in American Fork, Utah for a three year term beginning October 1, 2024. The base rent is $0 for the first three months

The Company’s lease agreements do not contain
any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. The Company’s lease agreements do not have an explicit renewal option,
and the termination options are available in the event of material breaches. Both leases are classified as operating leases under ASC
842.

$767,269 for the two new lease agreements and an initial ROU asset in the same amount which was recorded on the books at the commencement
of the leases. During the years ended May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024, the Company recorded operating lease costs in the amount of $193,077 and
$74,635, respectively. Operating lease and short-term lease expenses are included in General and administrative expenses on the accompanying

amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our financial statements. In evaluating matters for accrual
and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar nature, the specific
facts and circumstances asserted, the likelihood of our prevailing, the availability of insurance, and the severity of any potential
loss. We reevaluate and update accruals as matters progress over time. These legal accruals may be increased or decreased to reflect
any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, we do not record
an accrual, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. In the opinion of management, while the outcome of such claims and disputes
cannot be predicted with certainty, our ultimate liability in connection with these matters is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, and the amounts accrued for any individual matter are not material.
However, legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that any expense, liability, or damages that may ultimately
result from the resolution of these matters will be covered by our insurance or will not be in excess of amounts recognized or provided
by insurance coverage. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of
operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.

Note 13 – Business Segment and Geographic Area Information
Business Segments
The Company operates in two reportable segments:
Hearing Enhancement and Protection and Hair and Skin Care. The segments are determined based on the nature of the products sold and how
the business is managed. On May 5, 2025, the Company incorporated a new wholly owned subsidiary, Sharper Vision Marketing Inc., which
did not have any material
activity for the year ended May 31, 2025.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”)
is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The CODM evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based primarily on
a segment profit measure referred to as Segment non-cash operating income, which the Company has concluded is the measure of segment
profitability. This non-GAAP measure is defined as operating income from segment operations before depreciation and amortization, stock-based
compensation expense and corporate expenses. Corporate expenses primarily include insurance, expenses related to operating as a public
company—including fees paid to related parties for executive management services—corporate office rent, and stock-based compensation
for management.
The CODM reviews Segment non-cash operating income
for each segment regularly to assess performance and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources.
A reconciliation of Segment non-cash operating income
to the most directly comparable measure under U.S. GAAP is Income from Operations and is included in the table below.
The Company’s segment information is as follows:

There was no valuation allowance at May 31, 2025
and 2024.
As of May 31, 2025, the Company had California
net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $1,289,587. These NOLs are available to offset future taxable income, subject
to applicable limitations. California NOLs are generally subject to a 20-year carryforward period. As of May 31, 2025, the Company did
not have any federal or Utah NOL carryforwards.
During the year ended May 31, 2025, the Company utilized
approximately $465,613 of its federal NOLs and $123,216 of its California NOLs to offset taxable income. Based on recent operating results
and projected future income, management believes it is more likely than not that the remaining NOL carryforwards will be fully realized.
Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been recorded as of May 31, 2025.
