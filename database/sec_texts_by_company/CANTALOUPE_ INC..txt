The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Due to rounding, figures in tables may not sum exactly.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, regarding, among other things, the anticipated financial and operating results of Cantaloupe, Inc. For this purpose, forward-looking statements are any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact and include, but are not limited to, those preceded by or that include the words “estimate,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “likely,” “may,” “will,” “plan,” “intend,” “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “projected,” or similar expressions. Those statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. The forward-looking information is based on various factors and was derived using numerous assumptions. Important factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected include, for example:•disruption to our business caused by the acquisition of us by 365 Retail Markets, LLC (“365 Retail Markets”);•our ability to consummate the transaction with 365 Retail Markets within the contemplated timeframe, or at all, including risks and uncertainties related to securing the necessary regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other closing conditions;•the impact on our stock price, business, financial condition and results of operations if the proposed transaction with 365 Retail Markets is not consummated;•costs, charges and expenses relating to the proposed transaction with 365 Retail Markets;•proceedings, including litigation that seeks to prevent the proposed transaction with 365 Retail Markets from being consummated within the contemplated timeframe, or at all;•general economic, market or business conditions unrelated to our operating performance, including inflation, elevated interests rates, supply chain disruptions, financial institution disruptions, geopolitical conflicts, public health emergencies, and declines in consumer confidence and discretionary spending;•    our ability to compete with our competitors and increase market share;•    failure to comply with the financial covenants in our debt facilities;•    our ability to maintain compliance with rules and regulations applicable to our business operations and industry;•    disruptions in other card payment processors, software and manufacturing partners upon whom we rely;•    whether our customers continue to utilize our transaction processing and related services, as our customer agreements are generally cancellable by the customer with thirty days’ notice;•our ability to acquire and develop relevant technology offerings for current, new and potential customers and partners;•risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in Europe, Mexico and other foreign markets, including general economic conditions, policy changes affecting international trade (including the imposition of new tariffs, or changes and adjustments to existing tariffs), political instability, inflation rates, recessions, sanctions, foreign currency exchange rates and controls, foreign investment and repatriation restrictions, legal and regulatory constraints, civil unrest, armed conflict, war, and other economic and political factors;•    our ability to satisfy our trade obligations included in accounts payable and accrued expenses;•our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel, or our loss of the services of our key executives;•    the incurrence by us of any unanticipated or unusual non-operating expenses, which may require us to divert our cash resources from achieving our business plan;•    our ability to predict or estimate our future quarterly or annual revenue and expenses given the developing and unpredictable market for our products;•    our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies into our current products and services structure;3•    our ability to add new customers and retain key existing customers from whom a significant portion of our revenue is derived;•    the ability of a key customer to reduce or delay purchasing products from us;•    our ability to obtain widespread commercial acceptance of our products and service offerings;•whether any patents issued to us will provide any competitive advantages or adequate protection for our products, or would be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others;•    the ability of our products and services to avoid disruptions to our systems or unauthorized hacking or credit card fraud;•risks associated with cyber-attacks and data breaches; and•our ability to maintain effective internal controls and to timely file periodic and current reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Actual results or business conditions may differ materially from those projected or suggested in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including, but not limited to, those described above and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. We cannot assure you that we have identified all the factors that create uncertainties. Moreover, new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all risks on our business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Business.OVERVIEWCantaloupe, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTLP) is organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We are a global technology leader powering self-service commerce. Cantaloupe offers a comprehensive suite of solutions including micro-payment processing, self-checkout kiosks, mobile ordering, connected point-of-sale ("POS") systems, and enterprise cloud software. Handling more than a billion transactions annually, our solutions enhance operational efficiency and consumer engagement across sectors like food & beverage markets, smart automated retail, hospitality, entertainment venues, laundromats and more. Committed to innovation, we aim to drive advancements in digital payments and business optimization, serving 34,896 customers in the United States, United Kingdom, European Union countries, Australia, and Mexico.Our revenue streams consist of subscription, transaction processing and equipment sales. We derive the majority of our revenues from subscription and transaction fees resulting from transactions on, as well as connectivity and telemetry services provided by, our cashless devices, Seed™ software, Cantaloupe Go software, Cheq software (acquired in February 2024), SB Software (acquired in September 2024), and our API services used via our Seed API (formerly known as Quick Connect) product. These services include digital payment processing, loyalty programs, inventory management, route logistics optimization, warehouse and accounting management, intelligent merchandising, digital advertising, mobile ordering, and more. Devices and POS terminals operating on the Company’s platform and using our services include those resulting from the sale, finance or a monthly bundled subscription (Cantaloupe ONE program) of our POS electronic payment devices and 5checkout kiosks, telemetry devices, certified payment software or the servicing of similar third-party installed POS terminals and telemetry devices. The majority of customers pay a monthly service fee plus a blended percentage rate on transaction volumes. Transaction fees on volumes processed through our payment devices and POS systems are the most significant driver of our revenues.Merger with 365 Retail Markets, LLCOn June 15, 2025, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with 365 Retail Markets, Catalyst Holdco I, Inc. (“Holdco”), Catalyst Holdco II, Inc. (“Holdco II”) and Catalyst MergerSub Inc. (“Merger Sub”). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, 365 Retail Markets has agreed to acquire the Company in an all-cash transaction for $11.20 per share of common stock, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of 365 Retail Markets. Upon the consummation of the Merger, Cantaloupe will cease to be a publicly traded company.We have agreed to various customary covenants and agreements in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, agreements to conduct our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger. We do not believe these restrictions will prevent us from meeting our debt service obligations, ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs, or capital expenditure requirements.On September 4, 2025, the Company held a special meeting of shareholders, where shareholders approved a proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, including the Merger. Assuming timely satisfaction of the remaining necessary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals, we expect that the Merger will be completed in the second half of calendar year 2025. Upon consummation of the Merger, our common stock will be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and deregistered under Section 12(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).Additional information about the Merger is set forth in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 4, 2025, and our definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on July 24, 2025 (the "Definitive Proxy Statement").THE INDUSTRYWe offer a variety of solutions for self-service commerce, which enable the acceptance of digital payments and allow our customers to simplify inventory, analytics, warehouse, logistics, and back-office management. We believe the following industry trends are driving growth in demand for digital payment systems and advanced logistics management both in general and within the specific markets we serve:•Increased adoption of cashier-less models via vending machines, self-service kiosks, automated stores, and mobile ordering to meet demand for and more use of fast, simple and seamless digital purchase and payment experiences;•Rising consumer demand for transaction convenience, safety, and security, as evidenced by the growth in digital payment adoption, especially contactless payments; and•Ongoing labor challenges and inflation drive increased utility of actionable operational business intelligence from new technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence ("AI") to drive operational efficiencies and operational transparency through modern, cloud-based logistics and inventory management solutions.Cashier-less stores that minimize or remove human intervention have shifted consumer expectations on retail shopping experiences. Retailers are also finding that self-service helps them respond to the ongoing labor challenges and inflation costs they are facing while also appealing to changing consumer habits who are eager to use self-checkout solutions. 6OUR SOLUTIONWe aim to transform self-service commerce by offering one integrated solution for payments processing, logistics, and back-office management.

The markets for our products and services are characterized by evolving industry standards, aggressive pricing, continuous innovation, and changing consumer trends. Many of our competitors are challenging our industry position as an industry leader, particularly when it comes to pricing, emulating products, services, and marketing, as well as addressing consumer trends. However, we believe we have competitive strengths that position us for continued success. Consumers are expecting more from their shopping experience, with access to buy what they want, when they want, with the ability to pay with any shape or form of digital currency. This has led to a multitude of new devices on the market that enable a more engaging experience at the POS. In addition, micro markets are becoming larger growth sectors in the convenience services industry, with many competitors. While we believe we have a strong competitive offering that positions us favorably in software services for self-service industry, competitors are entering the market with modernized back-end systems that are focused on the user interface along with real-life product planogram possibilities. MARKETS WE SERVEWhile the below key verticals represent only a fraction of our total market potential, these are the areas where we have seen the most traction to date.10OUR GROWTH OPPORTUNITYOur primary objective is to continue enhancing our position as a leading provider of technology powering self-service commerce. Our vertically integrated solutions are designed to fuel growth by offering payment processing, enterprise cloud software, IoT technology, as well as kiosk and POS innovations that serve a variety of locations such as vending, micro markets and smart retail, entertainment venues and festivals, EV charging stations, laundromats, metered parking terminals, amusement and entertainment venues, IoT services and more. Key elements of our strategy are to:Maximize Growth in Existing Customers/Partners. Having experienced the benefits of our products and services, we believe our current customers represent the largest opportunity to scale recurring revenue and connections, through the addition of new products and services, as well as expanding our footprint of current product offerings. We are continuously seeking to enhance our solutions and services with additional features and functionality that create add-on service offerings to existing customers such as RPC, Seed Markets, Seed Analytics, Seed Pick Easy, and Cantaloupe Go POS solutions. We believe our continued innovation will lead to further adoption of Cantaloupe’s solutions and services in the self-service market.Capitalize on the Emerging Cashless, Contactless, EMV, NFC, and Growing Mobile Payments Trends Globally. With growing consumer adoption of cashless and digital wallet payments, we believe this trend will continue to drive significant opportunity for us to further penetrate cashless transactions in both existing and new markets in the United States and abroad.Expand into Micro Markets and Smart Stores. With our Cantaloupe Go platform, we are expanding the growing vertical of micro markets and smart stores both in near-vending channels as well as adjacent verticals. We differentiate ourselves by providing a single platform to manage consumer and operational aspects of micro markets and smart stores, while also integrating multiple service providers for flexibility and ultimate ease to our customers.Capitalize on Opportunities in International Markets. With the acquisitions of Three Square Market in December 2022 and SB Software in September 2024, as well setting up operations in Mexico, we believe we are well positioned to expand across Mexico and Europe, while focusing on increasing market share in the United States. We are focused on continuing to grow our self-checkout micro market kiosks in these regions while also leveraging our Seed platform to optimize a customer’s vending and micro market business. Along with POS terminals, Smart Markets, Cantaloupe Go platform and Seed platform, we’ll establish a presence in cashless payment devices to give a one-stop-shop for our customers. In order to do so, we have dedicated sales resources to spearhead international opportunities, support implementation, and customer success.Deliver an Exceptional Guest Experience at Stadiums, Venues and Festivals. With our acquisition of Cheq in February 2024, we believe we are also well positioned to disrupt the POS market that supports both large and small entertainment venues, stadiums, festivals, state fairs and more. As a mobile-first built POS, the platform is focused on ensuring guests never miss a moment with in-seat mobile ordering, handhelds to take payments anywhere in venue, and both attended or self-checkout stations for fast-tracking lines. With our existing penetration across more than a dozen venues, we plan to continue delivering a POS platform that meets the consumer needs of today and into the future.Further Penetrate Attractive Adjacent Markets. We will continue to introduce our turn-key solutions and services to various adjacent markets and verticals where there is a strong need for convenience, safety and security. Key growth verticals we will focus on include amusement and arcades, residential buildings, hotels and hospitality, college campuses and universities and retailers seeking new ways to create grab-and-go experiences both in-store and off-premise concepts. We plan to leverage solutions like our Cantaloupe Go line of products for micro markets, smart coolers and cashless payment acceptance to meet the needs of these industries seeking to deliver self-service solutions for today's consumer. Extend IoT Services into New Verticals. Leveraging Seed’s ability to know where to go, when to go, and what to take, we can extend our telemetry services into other verticals that currently run on static scheduling models. We believe these verticals provide tremendous greenfield to move static routes to dynamic, servicing locations at the right time and driving greater efficiencies into business operators who provide these services on a daily basis. Comprehensive Service and Support. In addition to its industry-leading hardware and software, we seek to provide our customers with a comprehensive platform designed to encourage optimal return on investment through business planning and performance optimization; a loyalty and rewards program for consumer engagement; sales data and machine alerts; DEX data transmission; and the ability to extend digital payments capabilities and the full suite of services across multiple aspects of an operator’s business.11SALES AND MARKETINGOur go-to-market strategy includes both direct sales and indirect channels, depending on the particular dynamics of each of our markets.

The Merger Agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the Merger and prohibits us, without 365 Retail Markets’ consent, from taking certain specified actions until the Merger has been consummated. These prohibitions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Further, in connection with the Merger, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the Merger, which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us following the Merger, and may depart prior to the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain key employees to the same extent that we have been able to in the past.The Merger could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties.The Merger may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. It may also divert management’s time and attention from the day-to-day operation of our businesses and the execution of our other strategic initiatives. This could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur other significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable regardless of whether or not such transaction is consummated.Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, our financial condition and our results of operations and prospects.The Merger may not be consummated within the intended timeframe, or at all, and the failure to consummate the Merger will adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the Merger will be consummated within the intended timeframe, or at all. The Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the Merger, including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino ("HSR") Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”).
Subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by law, waiver of requisite closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the requisite statutory waiting period under the HSR Act described below, the Company currently expects the Merger to be completed in the second half of calendar year 2025. However, there can be no assurance that the remaining closing conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and if all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance that the Merger will be consummated promptly or at all. There may be a significant or longer than expected time period between the approval of the Merger by our shareholders on September 4, 2025 and the closing of the Merger, due to the timing of required regulatory approvals, satisfaction of other closing conditions, or other factors, including those described herein.15For instance, at any time before the effective time of the Merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any state could take action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest with respect to the Merger, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, to rescind the Merger, or to conditionally approve the Merger upon the divestiture of assets, or to impose restrictions on the our operations or the operations of 365 Retail Markets following the completion of the Merger. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. There can be no assurance that the Merger will not be challenged on antitrust grounds or, if such a challenge is made, that the challenge will not be successful. The Merger is complex in nature, and unanticipated developments, including among other things, changes in law, the macroeconomic environment, market conditions, regulatory or geopolitical conditions, may affect our, or 365 Retail Market’s ability to close the Merger as currently expected and within the anticipated timeframe. If the Merger is not consummated within the intended timeframe or at all, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the Merger or may realize them on a different timeline than expected. The price of our common stock could significantly decline if the Merger is not consummated within the intended timeframe or at all. In addition, some costs related to the Merger must be paid whether or not the Merger is consummated, as we have already incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger. If the Merger is not consummated within the intended timeframe or at all, we may also experience negative reactions from our investors, customers, partners, suppliers, and employees. Along with transaction costs and fees, the Merger has required and will continue to require the attention and resources of our management team. If the Merger is not consummated within the intended timeframe or at all, our management team’s attention and resources will have been diverted from other uses with little to no additional benefit to the Company.We have in the past, and may again in future, become subject to lawsuits relating to the Merger, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We and/or our respective directors and officers have in the past, and may again in the future, become subject to lawsuits relating to the Merger. Such litigation is very common in connection with acquisitions of public companies, regardless of the merits of the underlying acquisition. For instance, as previously disclosed, following the filing of our Preliminary Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC on July 11, 2025 and the Definitive Proxy Statement (the “Proxy Statements”) in connection with the Merger, we received certain complaints and demand letters on behalf of purported Cantaloupe shareholders alleging deficiencies regarding the disclosures contained in the Proxy Statements.
These complaints (the “Complaints”) asserted individual claims against the Company and the members of our board of directors for negligent misrepresentation and concealment and negligence, based upon information included in or omitted from the Proxy Statements. The Complaints sought, among other relief, an injunction enjoining the defendants from consummating the Merger unless we disclose the material information allegedly omitted from the Proxy Statement, rescission of the Merger in the event it is consummated without our disclosure of the material information allegedly omitted from the Proxy Statement and an award of costs, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses. In addition, we have received certain demand letters (the “Demand Letters”) alleging deficiencies regarding the disclosures contained in the Proxy Statements.While we believe that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statements fully comply with all applicable law and deny the allegations set forth in the Complaints and Demand Letters, in order to moot the purported shareholders’ disclosure claims, to avoid nuisance and possible expense and disruption to the Merger and to provide additional information to our shareholders, on August 22, 2025, we filed additional supplemental proxy materials with the SEC, containing supplemental disclosures.While we will evaluate and defend against the foregoing any similar actions vigorously, the costs of the defense of such lawsuits and other effects of such litigation, including potential delays to the Merger, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.16Risks related to our businessGeneral economic, market or business conditions unrelated to our operating performance, including global supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures and tariffs could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The global payments technology industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer, business and government spending. We are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence, spending, and discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits. A sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical conflicts, political uncertainty, inflationary pressure, tariffs, elevated interest rates or interest rate fluctuations such as those that occurred recently, may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or active devices, active customers and total number of transactions using our payment solutions. A downturn in the economy and other adverse economic trends may accelerate the timing, or increase the impact of, risks to our financial performance. These trends could include the following:•low levels of consumer and business confidence typically associated with recessionary environments may result in decreased spending by consumers;•higher consumer debt levels or high unemployment may result in decreased spending by consumers;•budgetary concerns in the United States and other countries could affect sovereign credit ratings, and impact consumer confidence and spending; •supply chain disruptions may result in decreased spending by consumers whose ability to provide goods and services is materially impacted;•supply chain disruptions could also impact our ability to purchase devices for existing or prospective customers; •current and potential future inflationary pressures, which may adversely impact spending by consumers; and•deterioration of emerging market economies, which tend to be more sensitive to adverse economic trends than the more established markets we serve.In addition, climate-related events, including extreme weather events and natural disasters and their effect on critical infrastructure in the U.S. or internationally, could have similar adverse effects on our customers and our operations.Impacts of widespread inflation and tariffs could negatively affect our industry. Our own costs, including labor, hardware, services, technology providers, and other variable expenses could be impacted by severe, widespread or continuing inflation and the levying of tariffs. Our customer base includes many small businesses, some of which operate on tight margins. Our customers may not successfully navigate a rising cost environment, causing collection issues or bankruptcies. Inflation could seriously erode the discretionary buying decisions of consumers, impacting size of purchases or volumes at our unattended points of sale. We only recently began to be profitable and if we incur losses in the future, the price of our shares can be expected to fall.We experienced losses from inception through June 30, 2012, and from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2022. For fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, we recognized net income of $64.5 million, $12.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Despite recent profitability, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be profitable in the future. Accordingly, we may be required to use our cash and cash equivalents on hand and may raise capital to meet cash flow requirements including the issuance of common stock or debt financing. Additionally, if we incur losses in the future, the price of our common stock can be expected to fall. 17If we are not able to implement successful enhancements and new features for our products and services, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our success depends on our ability to develop new products and services to address the rapidly evolving market for cashless payments and cloud and mobile solutions for the self-service retail markets. Rapid and significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate, including developments in proximity payment devices. These new services and technologies may be superior to, impair, or render obsolete the products and services we currently offer or the technologies we currently use to provide them. Incorporating new and acquired technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and we may not be successful in realizing a return on these development efforts in a timely manner or at all. There can be no assurance that any new products or services we develop and offer to our customers will achieve significant commercial acceptance. Our ability to develop new products and services may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payment card networks, existing and future laws and regulations, resistance to change from our customers, challenges of integration with a wide variety of legacy end-point machines, or third parties’ intellectual property rights. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our products and services or to develop new products and services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments and evolving industry standards, our business would be materially and adversely affected.In addition, because our products and services are designed to operate with a variety of systems, infrastructures, and devices, we need to continuously modify and enhance our products and services to keep pace with changes in mobile, software, communication, and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. Any failure of our products and services to continue to operate effectively with third-party infrastructures and technologies could reduce the demand for our products and services, result in dissatisfaction of our customers, and materially and adversely affect our business.Substantially all of the service contracts with our customers are terminable for any or no reason upon thirty days advance notice. Substantially all of our customers may terminate their services with us for any or no reason by providing us with thirty days' advance notice, subject to early termination fees. Accordingly, consistent demand for and satisfaction with our products by our customers is critical to our financial condition and future success. Problems, outages, defects, or other issues with our products or services or competition in the marketplace could cause us to lose a substantial number of our customers with minimal notice. If a substantial number of our customers were to exercise their termination rights, it would result in a material adverse effect to our business, operating results, and financial condition.We may not successfully implement our go-to-market strategy which may adversely affect growth and profitability. Our current core business is highly concentrated among several large customers in the vending industry. We have made inroads into other adjacent markets including micro-markets, laundry, gaming, entertainment, vehicle services, and other commercial payments applications and continued expansion into these markets is a substantial piece of our potential future growth prospects. Changing technology, customer preferences, and competitor actions may limit our ability to successfully grow and expand beyond our core business.We engage in the outsourcing of engineering work, including outsourcing of software work overseas.We may, from time-to-time, outsource engineering work related to the design, development, and operations of our products and services, typically to save money and gain access to additional engineering resources. We have worked, and expect to work in the future, with companies located in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including, but not limited to Sweden, Romania, Columbia, Russia, Ukraine, India and Bangladesh. If we are unable to properly manage and oversee the outsourcing of engineering and other work to third parties located internationally that operate under different laws and regulations than those in the U.S., we could suffer the loss of valuable intellectual property, or the loss of the ability to claim such intellectual property, including patents and trade names. Additionally, instead of saving money, we could in fact incur significant additional costs because of inefficient engineering services and poor work product, which could harm our business, financial results, reputation, and brand.18The loss of one or more of our key customers could significantly reduce our revenues, results of operations, and reduce net income.We have derived, and believe we will continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from one large customer or a limited number of large customers. Customer concentrations for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: For the year ended June 30,Single customer202520242023Total revenue10 %9%12%The loss of such customers could materially adversely affect our revenues. Additionally, a major customer in one year may not purchase any of our products or services in another year, which may negatively affect our financial performance. We have offered, and may in the future offer, discounts to our large customers to incentivize them to continue to utilize our products and services. If we are required to sell products to any of our large customers at reduced prices or unfavorable terms, our revenue and earnings could be materially adversely affected. Further, there is no assurance that our customers will continue to utilize our transaction processing and related services as our customer agreements are generally cancellable by the customer on thirty days notice. Increases in card association and debit network interchange fees could increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. We are obligated to pay interchange fees and other network fees set by the bankcard networks to the card issuing bank and the bankcard networks for each transaction we process through our network. From time to time, card associations and debit networks increase the organization and/or processing fees, known as interchange fees that they charge. Under our processing agreements with our customers, we are permitted to pass along these fee increases to our customers through corresponding increases in our processing fees. Passing along such increases could result in some of our customers canceling their contracts with us. Consequently, it is possible that competitive pressures will result in us absorbing some or all of the increases in the future, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our gross profit and adversely affect our business.Our efforts to expand into international markets may not be successful; our products and services may not gain traction in new markets; and managing international operations may be challenging or may fail.
As we seek to expand into international markets, we may not be successful, or our plans may be delayed. Our products will need to be localized in some cases and if our localization efforts fail or are delayed or our products and services do not gain traction in new markets, our business could be adversely affected. Geopolitical conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflicts between Israel and Hamas and Israel and Iran, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.While we do not currently have employees, customers or corporate offices in impacted areas, we have worked, and expect to work in the future, with companies located in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including, but not limited to Ukraine. In addition, we are focused on international expansion. As a result, our operations and international expansion efforts could be impacted by economic, political and other conditions resulting from the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflicts between Israel and Hamas and Israel and Iran, which could, among other things, lead to a reduction in consumer, government or corporate spending, international sanctions, embargoes, heightened inflation, volatility in global financial markets, increased cyber disruptions or attacks, higher supply chain costs and increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate, which could result in charges related to the recoverability of assets, including financial assets, long-lived assets and goodwill and other losses, and could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. To the extent the Russia-Ukraine conflict or the Israel-Hamas and Israel-Iran conflicts adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in this Annual Report, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 19Increased scrutiny from shareholders, customers and other stakeholders regarding our environmental, social, and governance, or sustainability responsibilities, could adversely impact our liquidity, results of operations, reputation, and stock price.Shareholders, customers and other stakeholders have begun to consider how corporations are addressing environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues. Government regulators, investors, customers and the general public are increasingly focused on ESG practices and disclosures, and views about ESG are diverse and rapidly changing. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of our common stock if investors determine that the Company has not made sufficient progress on ESG matters. We could also face potential negative ESG-related publicity in traditional media or social media if shareholders or other stakeholders determine that we have not adequately considered or addressed ESG matters.Operational and liquidityDisruptions to our systems, breaches in the security of transactions involving our products or services, or failure of our processing systems could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations. We rely on information technology and other systems to transmit financial information of consumers making cashless transactions and to provide accounting and inventory management services to our customers. As such, the information we transmit and/or maintain is exposed to the ever-evolving threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, cyber-attack or unauthorized or fraudulent use by consumers, customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. While we have implemented various cybersecurity defense mechanisms and risk management initiatives, there can be no assurance that such mechanisms and initiatives will be effective, and may experience a cybersecurity breach. A cybersecurity breach of our informational technology systems, or those of third parties upon whom we rely, could result in disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property, or cause operational disruptions and compromised data. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems because they change frequently and often are not detected until after an incident has occurred. Further, cybersecurity attacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated, including through emerging AI technologies, which may intensify or exacerbate cybersecurity risks or introduce new risks.In addition, our processing systems may experience errors, interruptions, delays or damage from a number of causes, including, but not limited to, power outages, hardware, software and network failures, internal design, manual or usage errors, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing, catastrophic events, climate-related events such as natural disasters and severe weather conditions. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks, including annual validation of our compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact the marketplace acceptance of our products and services, and could result in significant remedial expenses to not only assess and repair any damage to our systems, but also to reimburse customers for losses that occur from service interruptions or the fraudulent use of confidential data. Additionally, we could become subject to significant fines, litigation, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results.Furthermore, the technology systems of businesses that we have acquired, or may acquire, as well as their practices related to the collection, use, maintenance, and disclosure of data, could present issues that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition or other issues that continue to pose risk to use, such as cybersecurity vulnerabilities or past cybersecurity or privacy incidents. Following an acquisition, we take steps to ensure our data and system security protection measures cover the acquired business as part of our integration process. As such, there may be a period of increased cybersecurity risk during the period between closing an acquisition and the completion of our data and system security integration. Furthermore, despite these efforts, especially in light of increasingly sophisticated techniques used in cybersecurity attacks, our information technology systems and those of third parties with who we do business or communicate may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, computer viruses, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events and in these circumstances where we cannot fully anticipate, detect, repel, or implement fully effective preventative measures, our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate.We depend on our key personnel and, if they leave us, or if we are unable to attract highly skilled personnel, our business could be adversely affected.While we have maintained business continuity and operational success despite recent management changes over the past several years, our success and future growth also depends, to a significant degree, on the skills and continued services of our management team. Further, due to the complexity of the work required to make needed improvements within the Company, it may be difficult for us to retain existing senior management and new hires, sales personnel, and development and engineering personnel critical to our ability to execute our business plan, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. 20We may experience a loss of productivity due to the departure of key personnel and the associated loss of institutional knowledge, or while new personnel integrate into our business and transition into their respective roles. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, marketing and customer service personnel, including members of our management team.The termination of our relationships with certain third-party suppliers upon whom we rely for services that are critical to our products could adversely affect our business and delay achievement of our business plan. The operation of our networked devices depends upon the capacity, reliability and security of services provided to us by our wireless telecommunication services providers, equipment manufacturers and other suppliers. In addition, if we terminate relationships with our current telecommunications service providers and other third-party suppliers, we may have to replace hardware that is part of our existing ePort, Seed, or other products that are already installed in the marketplace. This could significantly harm our reputation and could cause us to lose customers and revenue.We rely on other card payment processors, and if they fail or no longer agree to provide their services or we fail to operate in compliance with the requirements of those relationships, our customer relationships could be adversely affected, and we could lose business. We rely on agreements with other large payment processing organizations to enable us to provide card authorization, data capture and transmission, settlement and merchant accounting services for the customers we serve. The termination by our card processing providers of their arrangements with us or their failure to perform their services efficiently and effectively would adversely affect our relationships with the customers whose accounts we serve and may cause those customers to terminate their processing agreements with us.Further, substantially all of the cashless payment transactions handled by our network involve the three largest credit card associations. If we fail to comply with the applicable standards or requirements of these card associations relating to security, they could suspend or terminate our registration with them. The termination of our registration with them or any changes in the respective rules that would impair our registration with them could require us to stop providing cashless payment services through our network. In such event, our business plan and/or competitive advantages in the market place would be materially adversely affected.Disruptions at other participants in the financial system could prevent us from delivering our cashless payment services. The operations and systems of many participants in the financial system are interconnected. Many of the transactions that involve our cashless payment services rely on multiple participants in the financial system to accurately move funds and communicate information to the next participant in the transaction chain. A disruption for any reason at one of the participants in the financial system could impact our ability to cause funds to be moved in a manner to successfully deliver our services. Although we work with other participants to avoid any disruptions, there is no assurance that such efforts will be effective. Such a disruption could lead to the inability for us to deliver services, reputational damage, lost customers and lost revenue, loss of customers’ confidence, as well as additional costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability, financial condition, and future growth.Any increase in chargebacks not paid by our customers may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In the event a dispute between a cardholder and a customer is not resolved in favor of the customer, the transaction is normally charged back to the customer and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. If we are unable to collect such amounts from the customer's account, or if the customer refuses or is unable, due to closure, bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us for a chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. We may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future. Any increase in chargebacks not paid by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have policies to manage customer-related credit risk and attempt to mitigate such risk by monitoring transaction activity. Notwithstanding our programs and policies for managing credit risk, it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.21We may not fully realize the benefits of acquisitions, it may take longer than we anticipate for us to achieve those benefits, they may be difficult to integrate, may disrupt our business, or divert management attention and may adversely affect our financial condition.We could acquire additional products, technologies, or businesses to complement or expand our existing business. We may be unable to negotiate favorable terms in a timely manner or at all. Negotiation and integration of these types of potential business combinations could divert management’s time and resources. In addition, we may encounter unanticipated costs, operational challenges, or potential disruption of our business and diversion of management’s attention from our core business. We may not realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions. We could reduce the cash that would otherwise be available to fund operations or other purposes, or we could incur debt, potentially on unfavorable terms. Additionally, for any future acquisition, we need to determine the appropriate level of integration of products, services, associates, and information technology, financial, human resources, compliance, and other systems and processes, and then successfully manage that integration into our corporate structure. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. In addition, the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems, internal controls, technology and cybersecurity systems, and operations and may make them more difficult to manage. Even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional risks and liabilities.Our dependence on proprietary technology and limited ability to protect our intellectual property may adversely affect our ability to compete.Challenge to our ownership of our intellectual property could materially damage our business prospects. Our technology may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others. Our ability to execute our business plan is dependent, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our proprietary products, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.As of June 30, 2025, the United States Government and other countries have granted us 143 patents, of which 49 are still in force. Our patents expire between 2024 and 2038. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renew any of these patents following their expiration. We also have a number of pending patent applications, and will consider filing applications for additional patents covering aspects of our future developments, although there can be no assurance that we will do so. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will maintain or prosecute these applications. There can be no assurance that:•any of the remaining patent applications will be granted to us;•we will develop additional products that are patentable or that do not infringe the patents of others;•any patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantages or adequate protection for our products;•any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others; or•any of our products would not infringe the patents of others.If any of our products or services is found to have infringed any patent, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to continue to manufacture, use, sell, and license such product or service or that we will not have to pay damages and/or be enjoined as a result of such infringement.If we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology or fail to enforce or prosecute our patents against others, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us, which could result in the loss of customers and our business being adversely affected. Patent and proprietary rights litigation entails substantial legal and other costs and diverts Company resources as well as the attention of our management. There can be no assurance we will have the necessary financial resources to appropriately defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights in connection with any such litigation.22We may require additional financing or find it necessary to raise capital to sustain our operations and without it we may not be able to achieve our business plan.At June 30, 2025, we had a net working capital surplus of $70.5 million and cash and cash equivalents of $51.1 million. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $20.3 million, $27.7 million, and $14.2 million for fiscal years ended 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. We may need additional funds to continue these operations. We may also need additional capital to respond to unusual or unanticipated non-operational events. Should the financing that we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and future prospects.Failure to comply with any of the financial covenants under the Company’s debt facilities could result in an event of default which may accelerate our outstanding indebtedness or other obligations and have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity position and financial position.We are party to an amended and restated credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Capital One, N.A. which provides for a $30 million secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the “2025 Revolving Facility”) and a $40 million secured term facility (as amended, the “2025 Secured Term Facility”) and a $30 million secured delayed draw term loan facility (the "Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility", and together with the 2025 Revolving Facility and 2025 Secured Term Facility, the “2025 Credit Facility”).The 2025 Credit Facility has a five-year maturity and includes customary representations, warranties and covenants, and acceleration, indemnity and events of default provisions, including, among other things, two financial covenants. The first financial covenant requires the Company to maintain a total leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00 on the last day of any fiscal quarter. However, if a material acquisition occurs, the Company is required to maintain a total leverage ratio not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 on the last day of the fiscal quarter for the next four fiscal quarters following the material acquisition. The second financial covenant does not permit the Company to have a fixed charge coverage ratio of less than 1.15 to 1.00 for four consecutive fiscal quarters.We were in compliance with its financial covenants as of June 30, 2025. Failure to comply with the foregoing financial covenants, if not cured or waived, will result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owed under the 2025 Credit Facility and could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity position and financial position.We cannot be certain that our future operating results will be sufficient to ensure compliance with the financial covenants in the 2025 Credit Facility or to remedy any defaults. In addition, in the event of any event of default and related acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make the accelerated payments required under the 2025 Credit Facility.Upon the consummation of the Merger, our 2025 Credit Facility will be paid off in full. However, there can be no assurance that the Merger will be consummated within the anticipated timeline or at all. For additional discussion regarding our risks related to the Merger, see the risks described under the caption “Risks related to the Merger” in this Annual Report. In the event our indebtedness under the 2025 Credit Facility is not repaid in connection with the consummation of the Merger, our indebtedness exposes us to certain risks, including those risks set forth above.Legal, regulatory, and compliance risksWe are subject to laws and regulations that affect the products, services and markets in which we operate. Failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We are, among other things, subject to certain banking regulations and credit card association regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in the suspension of our business, the limitation, suspension or termination of service, and/or the imposition of fines that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Additionally, changes to legal rules and regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a negative financial effect on us or our product offerings. To the extent this occurs, we could be subject to additional technical, contractual or other requirements as a condition of our continuing to conduct our payment processing business. These requirements could cause us to incur additional costs, which could be significant, or to lose revenues to the extent we do not comply with these requirements.23We are subject to additional risks with respect to our current and potential international operations.We are subject to laws, regulations and business practices of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws, regulations and business practices expose us to risks that are different than or in addition to those commonly found in the United States. Risks relating to our international operations and properties include: •changing governmental rules and policies; •enactment of laws restricting the ability to remove profits earned from activities within a particular country to a person’s or company’s country of origin; •changes in laws or policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers, and any negative sentiments towards multinational companies as a result of any such changes to laws, regulations or policies or due to trends such as political populism and economic nationalism; •variations in currency exchange rates and the imposition of currency controls; •adverse market conditions caused by terrorism, civil unrest, natural disasters, infectious disease and changes in international, national or local governmental or economic conditions; •business disruptions arising from public health crises and outbreaks of communicable diseases; •the willingness of U.S. or international lenders to make loans in certain countries and changes in the availability, cost and terms of secured and unsecured debt resulting from varying governmental economic policies; •the imposition of unique tax structures and changes in other tax rates and other operating expenses in particular countries, including the potential imposition of adverse or confiscatory taxes; •the potential imposition of restrictions on currency conversions or the transfer of funds; •general political and economic instability; and •our limited experience and expertise in foreign countries, particularly European countries, relative to our experience and expertise in the United States. If any of the foregoing risks were to materialize, they could materially and adversely affect us.We could be subject to claims and lawsuits, which could require significant additional management time and attention, result in significant additional legal expenses or result in government enforcement actions.Litigation, investigation or other actions that may be filed or initiated against us may be time consuming and expensive. We cannot predict what losses we may incur in these matters, and contingencies related to our obligations under the federal and state securities laws, or in other legal proceedings or governmental investigations or proceedings related to these matters.Any legal proceedings, if decided adversely to us, could result in significant monetary damages, penalties and reputational harm, and will likely involve significant defense and other costs. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims that have been or may be brought against us, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. As a result, we may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, including pursuant to our indemnification obligations, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.Failure to maintain effective systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could cause a loss of confidence in our financial reporting and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide accurate financial information. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.24We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls in the past, including as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023. We have also previously restated certain of our consolidated financial statements (most recently in February 2020 for the fiscal period ended September 20, 2019). We may identify additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future. If any such control deficiencies occur in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements could be materially misstated. As a result, we may be forced to restate our financial statements and take other actions which will take significant financial and managerial resources, as well as be subject to fines and other government enforcement actions. A restatement of our financial results could, among other potential adverse effects, impact our ability to timely file our periodic reports until the restatement is completed. In addition, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock, perhaps significantly. In addition, we could become subject to investigations, litigation or disputes with stockholders, which could have an adverse impact on our business.Risks related to our common stockDirector and officer liability is limited and shareholders may have limited rights to recover against directors for breach of fiduciary duty.As permitted by Pennsylvania law, our by-laws limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of a director’s fiduciary duty except for liability in certain instances. As a result of our by-law provisions and Pennsylvania law, shareholders may have limited rights to recover against directors for breach of fiduciary duty. In addition, our by-laws and indemnification agreements entered into by the Company with each of the officers and directors provide that we shall indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law.An active trading market for our common stock may not be maintained. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain an active trading market for our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or any other exchange in the future. If an active market for our common stock is not maintained, or if we fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of Nasdaq for any reason and our securities are delisted, it may be difficult for our security holders to sell their securities without depressing the market price for the securities or at all. An inactive trading market may also impair our ability to both raise capital by selling shares of common stock and complete other acquisitions by using our shares of common stock as consideration.If securities and/or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly for any reason, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, it is likely that, in some future period, our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.Exclusion from the Russell 2000® Index could result in a decline in the price of our stock. Although we are currently included in the Russell 2000® Index, if our market capitalization were to fall below the minimum necessary, we could be dropped from inclusion. If we were no longer included in the Russell 2000® Index, it could result in a decline in demand for our common stock and, accordingly, the trading price of our common stock following such events. Upon certain fundamental transactions involving the Company, such as a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets, we may be required to distribute the liquidation preference then due to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock which would reduce the amount of the distributions otherwise to be made to the holders of our common stock in connection with such transactions.25Our articles of incorporation provide that upon a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets or upon the disposition of more than 50% of our voting power, the transaction will be treated as a liquidation if approved by the holders at least 50% of the preferred stock. Upon our liquidation, the holders of our preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidation preference prior to any distribution to the holders of common stock which, as of June 30, 2025 was approximately $23.3 million, inclusive of accrued dividends. No dividend may be paid on our common stock until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on our preferred stock have been paid.In addition, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company expects to redeem, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, all shares of our Series A Preferred Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the closing of the Merger. Following such redemption, the shares of our Series A Preferred Stock will be canceled for no consideration at the effective time of the Merger. However, there can be no assurance that the Merger, and therefore the redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock, will be consummated within the anticipated timeline or at all.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.None.Item 1C. CybersecurityRisk Management & StrategyOur cybersecurity program is designed to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets by monitoring the cyber threat landscape, internal threats and technological changes and through the development of controls to mitigate risk to the organization and our customers. While cybersecurity is a dynamic and constantly evolving field, we strive to minimize the occurrence and impact of unauthorized access, disruption to our information systems and are committed to staying informed about emerging threats, adopting industry best practices, and integrating feedback from our assessment and incidents. We deploy and manage both preventive and detective controls and processes to mitigate cybersecurity threats, including monitoring our network for known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized attempts to access our data and systems. We also deploy and manage preventive and detective controls and processes related to the mitigation of risks from our use of third-party service providers.Our organization undergoes annual reviews by third-party consultants to help assess the implementation and operational effectiveness of the security controls implemented in our service environment which is in scope for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS") and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") System and Organization Controls ("SOC").Our program is designed to guide our practices which are based on relevant industry frameworks and laws. This program consists of policies and procedures designed to manage material risks from cybersecurity threats, including training requirements, threat monitoring and detection and threat containment and risk assessments. Additionally, we leverage third-party firms to conduct routine external and internal penetration testing to emulate the common tactics and techniques of cyber threat actors and have processes to address identified vulnerabilities, although it may take time to mitigate or manage such vulnerabilities. The results of this testing are included in the Company's SOC report. Further, we also carry cyber security insurance, which is renewed annually and covers cyber events and business interruption. We closely monitor costs of breaches within the industry in an effort to ensure that our coverage is sufficient to address all reasonably foreseeable threats and levels of risk.We have an Incident Management Policy ("IMP") and Incident Response Plan ("IRP") which helps enable us to quickly detect, respond to, and recover from third-party malicious attacks and potential security incidents. This plan includes formal steps to review incidents and implement improvements, including steps to involve the CISO and CTO as appropriate.OversightOur Information Security Program is overseen by our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), who reports to our Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”). Our CISO oversees the third-party consultants who help assess our security controls and penetration testing previously described. The CTO provides oversight, leadership and direction for data risks, technology risks and information security risks. Our CISO leads the Cybersecurity organization and has the overall responsibility of implementing its strategy and objectives to build a strong cyber engineering function. 26Our CISO has over 20 years of information technology experience with specialization in information security and risk management.

The Merger is expected to close in the second half of calendar year 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.One Big Beautiful Bill ActOn July 4, 2025, new U.S. tax legislation was signed into law (known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” or “OBBBA”) which makes permanent many of the tax provisions enacted in 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that were set to expire at the end of 2025. In addition, the OBBBA makes changes to certain U.S. corporate tax provisions, but many are generally not effective until 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new legislation but does not expect it to have a material impact on the results of operations.30HighlightsHighlights of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 are below:•Revenues of $303 million, an increase of 13% year over year, led by higher transaction and subscription fees revenue.•$3.4 billion in dollar volume of transactions for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to $3.0 billion for the year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 13%.•1.28 million Active Devices as of June 30, 2025 compared to 1.22 million as of June 30, 2024, an increase of approximately 57 thousand Active Devices, or 5%.•34,896 Active Customers to our service as of June 30, 2025 compared to 31,466 as of June 30, 2024, an increase of 3,430 Active Customers, or 11%.•We acquired SB Software, which is in the business of vending and coffee management in the U.K. The acquisition enhances Cantaloupe's operational capabilities and market reach in Europe.•In August 2024, we launched Suites, a premium suite management system designed to streamline and enhance the hospitality suite experience at stadiums and venues.

The markets for our products and services are characterized by evolving industry standards, aggressive pricing, continuous innovation, and changing consumer trends. We believe the following macroeconomic conditions and specific industry trends and uncertainties are most likely to impact our financial results: •Our ability to meet rising demand from the increased adoption of cashier-less models via vending machines, self-service kiosks, and mobile ordering as consumer preferences for use of faster, simpler and more seamless digital purchase and payment experiences continues to grow;•Our ability to implement successful enhancements and new features for our products and services and to successfully target, acquire and integrate new businesses;•The broader implications of the macroeconomic environment, including a potentially sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, including as a result of supply chain disruptions, geopolitical conflicts (including the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas, and Israel and Iran), political uncertainty, inflationary pressure, tariffs, elevated interest rates or interest rate fluctuations such as those that occurred recently; and•Ongoing labor challenges and inflation drive increased utility of actionable operational business intelligence from new technologies like machine learning and AI to drive operational efficiencies and operational transparency through modern, cloud-based logistics and inventory management solutions.For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our business performance and our financial and operating results, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.KEY METRICSThe following table shows certain financial and non-financial data that management believes give readers insight into certain trends and relationships about the Company’s financial performance. We believe the metrics (Active Devices, Active Customers, Total Number of Transactions and Total Dollar Volume of Transactions) are useful in allowing management and readers to evaluate our strategy of driving growth in devices and transactions.Active Devices Active Devices are devices that have communicated with us or have had a transaction in the last twelve months. Included in the number of Active Devices are devices that communicate through other devices that communicate or transact with us. For example, a self-service retail location that utilizes an ePort cashless payment device as well as Seed management services constitutes only one device.Active CustomersThe Company defines Active Customers as all customers with at least one Active Device. 32Total Number of Transactions and Total Dollar Volume of TransactionsTransactions are defined as electronic payment transactions that are processed by our technology-enabled solutions. Management uses Total Number of Transactions and Total Dollar Volume of Transactions to evaluate the effectiveness of our new customer strategy and ability to leverage existing customers and partners.

The increase was attributable to a $23.4 million increase in transaction fees, an $8.3 million increase in subscription fees, and a $2.3 million increase in equipment sales. The increase in transaction fees was primarily driven by increased average ticket items sold, increased average ticket price, increased processing volumes, and the acquisition Cheq, with an approximately 13% increase in total dollar volumes for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the prior fiscal year. There was also an increase in the total number of active devices relative to the prior fiscal year.Our subscription fees increased approximately $8.3 million, or 11% for the year ended June 30, 2025 which is attributed to a continued focus of management to grow our recurring subscription services to our customer base and an increase in our active devices compared to last year as well as the acquisition of SB Software and Cheq.Equipment revenue increased by $2.3 million primarily due to the increased sales of our Smart Stores product, which we launched in December 2024.Costs of sales Costs of sales increased $12.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. The increase was attributed to a $11.3 million increase in cost of transaction fees, a $1.1 million increase in equipment costs, and a $0.4 million increase in cost of subscription fees. Cost of transaction fees increased primarily due to corresponding increases in transaction processing fee revenue and transaction processing volumes. Cost of equipment sales increased $1.1 million primarily due to increased equipment sales, in particular our new Smart Stores product.AmortizationAmortization of internal-use software assets and developed technology assets increased $4.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of certain capitalized internal-use software which is no longer expected to provide future economic benefits as a result of changes in business strategy and evolving technology initiatives and amortization of intangibles from the acquisitions of Cheq and SB Software.Operating ExpensesYear ended June 30,ChangePercent Change($ in thousands)202520242025 v. 2024Sales and marketing$23,075 $20,310 $2,765 13.6%Technology and product development17,449 16,532 917 5.5%General and administrative44,075 41,395 2,680 6.5%Investigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses, net of insurance recoveries— (1,522)1,522 (100.0%)Integration, acquisition, due diligence, and license application expenses1,018 1,197 (179)(15.0%)Depreciation and amortization15,877 10,570 5,307 50.2%Total operating expenses$101,494 $88,482 $13,012 14.7%Total operating expenses. Operating expenses increased by $13.0 million, or 14.7%, for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the prior fiscal year. The change was primarily attributed to an increase of $2.7 million in general and administrative expenses, a $2.8 million increase in sales and marketing costs, a $5.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization, a $1.5 million increase in investigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses, and a $0.9 million increase in technology and product development expenses. This increase was partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in Integration, acquisition, due diligence, and license application expenses. See further details within individual categories below.34Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $2.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. The change was primarily due to an increased $1.4 million due to advertising and trade show expenses and higher sales and marketing employee personnel costs in the current year with a $1.1 million increase due to employee compensation and benefits. The increased personnel costs are to support our expanding business and service offerings in the United States and international markets. Sales and marketing increased by $0.3 million due to various other marketing expenses.Technology and product development. Technology and product development expenses increased approximately $0.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. The increase in the current year was driven by a $1.0 million increase in subscriptions and cloud hosting fees, a $0.1 million increase in compensation and benefits, offset by a $0.1 decrease in contractor expenses and a $0.1 decrease in various other technology and product development expenses.General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $2.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. This is due to a $3.2 million increase in compensation and benefits, $1.3 million smaller release in sales and use taxes reserves compared to the same period last year, a $0.9 increase in bad debt expense and $0.1 million in other general and administrative expenses. This is offset by a $2.7 million decrease in contractor expenses.Investigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses, net of insurance recoveries. In April 2024, we agreed to a net settlement of approximately $1.5 million with a third-party insurance carrier related to the reimbursement of expenses associated with the 2019 Investigation. The settlement was recognized as a gain in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2024. There were no investigation, proxy solicitation, restatement expenses or insurance recoveries for the year ended June 30, 2025.Integration, acquisition, due diligence, and license application expenses. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Company integration, acquisition, due diligence and license application expenses were $1.6 million from accounting, legal, investing banking advisors and consulting services for the successful completion of the SB acquisition and seller due diligence fees associated with the sale of the Company as described in Note 21 - Subsequent Events. This is offset by a $0.6 million decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company incurred professional service fees of $1.2 million from accounting, legal, investing banking advisors and consulting services for the successful completion of the Cheq acquisition, as well as post-acquisition costs associated with the integration process.Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $5.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the prior fiscal year as a result of certain capitalized internal-use software which is no longer expected to provide future economic benefits as a result of changes in business strategy and evolving technology initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expenses also increased due to the amortization of intangibles from the acquisitions of Cheq and SB Software.Other (expense) income, Net Year ended June 30,ChangePercent Change($ in thousands)202520242025 v. 2024Other (expense) income:Interest income $1,561 $1,969 $(408)(20.7%)Interest expense(2,769)(2,934)165 (5.6%)Other income (expense), net1,059 (226)1,285 (568.6%)Total other (expense) income, net$(149)$(1,191)$1,042 (87.5%)Other (expense) income, netTotal other expense, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was $0.1 million, compared to an income of $1.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2024.Interest income decreased $0.4 million primarily due to a decrease in the finance receivables balance associated with our equipment financing program. Our interest expense decreased $0.2 million primarily due to the modification of our long-term debt as described in Note 7 - Debt and Other Financing Arrangements.35Other income (expense), net increased primarily due to realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe use non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision making. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP, and are not a substitute for or a measure of our profitability or net earnings.Adjusted Gross Profit and MarginWe define Adjusted Gross Profit as revenue less cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation of internally-developed software and amortization of intangible assets related to technologies obtained through acquisitions. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to view the resulting figures excluding the aforementioned non-cash charges because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and such amounts vary substantially from company to company depending on their financing and capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by revenue.We have provided below a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP gross profit to Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024:Year Ended June 30,ChangePercent Change($ in thousands)202520242025 v. 2024Gross profit, transaction (GAAP)$44,919 $32,871 $12,048 36.7 %Gross margin, transaction (GAAP)25.0 %21.0 %4.0 %Gross profit, subscription (GAAP)63,445 60,459 2,986 4.9 %Amortization(1)11,683 6,767 4,916 72.6 %Adjusted Gross Profit, subscription fees (non-GAAP)$75,128 $67,226 $7,902 11.8 %Adjusted Gross Margin, subscription fees (non-GAAP)89.9 %89.2 %Gross profit, equipment (GAAP)$3,777 $2,554 $1,223 47.9 %Gross margin, equipment (GAAP)9.6 %6.9 %2.7 %Total Adjusted Gross Profit (non-GAAP)$123,824 $102,651 $21,173 20.6 %Total Adjusted Gross Margin (non-GAAP)40.9 %38.2 %(1) Amortization of internal-use software assets and developed technology assets. For the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company recognized additional charges of $3.0 million, due to certain capitalized internal-use software is no longer expected to provide future economic benefits as a result of changes in business strategy and evolving technology initiatives.Total Adjusted Gross Margin (non-GAAP) was 40.9% for the year ended June 30, 2025, from 38.2% for the year ended June 30, 2024. The increase in Adjusted Gross Margin was primarily driven by an increase in our subscription fees revenue which is inherently a higher margin revenue stream. Additionally, our equipment sales gross margins improved from the prior fiscal year primarily driven by the diversification of our equipment sales and higher margins on certain micro market equipment.Adjusted EBITDAWe define Adjusted EBITDA as U.S. GAAP net income before (i) interest income, (ii) interest expense, (iii) income tax provision, (iv) depreciation, (v) amortization, (vi) stock-based compensation expense, and (vii) certain other significant infrequent or unusual losses and gains that are not indicative of our core operations such as (a) investigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses, net of insurance recoveries, (b) integration, acquisition, due diligence, and license application expenses, (c)
costs as a result of auditor transitions, (d) severance, and (e) remediation expenses. 36We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors in comparing our financial performance to other companies and from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and interest income, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on their financing and capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the impact of certain items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. Additionally, we utilize Adjusted EBITDA as a metric in our executive officer and management incentive compensation plans.Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, although depreciation expense is a non-cash charge, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new asset acquisitions. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. Adjusted EBITDA also does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces the cash available to us; or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. The expenses and other items which are excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items that other companies may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA when they report their financial results.Below is a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024:Year ended June 30,($ in thousands)20252024Net income$64,533 $11,993 Less: interest income(1,561)(1,969)Plus: interest expense2,769 2,934 Plus: income tax (benefit) provision(42,352)985 Plus: depreciation expense included in cost of sales for rentals1,923 1,634Plus: depreciation and amortization expense in operating expenses15,877 10,570 EBITDA41,189 26,147 Plus: stock-based compensation (a)4,008 5,109 Plus: investigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses, net of insurance recoveries (b) — (1,522)Plus: integration, acquisition, due diligence, and license application expenses (c)1,018 1,197 Plus: auditor transition costs525 — Plus: severance expenses (d)— 53 Plus: remediation expenses (e)— 2,976 Adjustments to EBITDA5,551 7,813 Adjusted EBITDA$46,740 $33,960 (a) We have excluded stock-based compensation, as it does not reflect our cash-based operations.(b) We have excluded the costs and corresponding reimbursements related to the 2019 Investigation, because we believe that they represent charges that are not related to our core operations. During the year ended June 30, 2024, we received $1.5 million in insurance reimbursement for legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the 2019 Investigation. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA contains a negative adjustment.(c) We have excluded expenses incurred in connection with business acquisitions as it does not represent recurring costs or charges related to our core operations. We have also excluded expenses incurred associated with the acquisition of the Company as described in Note 21 - Subsequent Events and one-time license applications fees.(d) Consists of expenses incurred in connection with non-recurring severance charges related to work force reduction.(e) Consists of expenses incurred in connection with fully remediating previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.37LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMerger with 365 Retail MarketsThe Merger Agreement with 365 Retail Markets imposes certain limitations on how we conduct our business during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger, including limitations on our ability to, among other things, engage in certain acquisitions, incur indebtedness or issue or sell new debt securities.Sources and Uses of CashHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operating activities, debt financings, and equity issuances. Our primary sources of capital available are cash and cash equivalents on hand of $51.1 million as of June 30, 2025 and the cash that we expect to be provided by operating activities.We believe that our current financial resources will be sufficient to fund its current twelve-month operating budget from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements. Our primary focus as part of our core operations to increase cash flow from operating activities is to prioritize collection efforts to reduce outstanding accounts receivable, utilize existing inventory to support equipment sales over the next year, focusing on various operational efficiencies to improve overall profitability of the business and continued to grow our business both domestically and internationally.Net cash provided by operating activitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $20.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to $27.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. We recognized $64.5 million in net income offset by $18.4 million in non-cash operating charges and $25.8 million cash utilized in working capital accounts. The change in working capital was primarily driven by a $25.0 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, a $4.6 million increase in prepaid and other current assets, and a $4.6 million increase in inventory, offset by a $4.7 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $4.8 million decrease in finance receivables and a $1.3 million increase in operating lease liabilities. The increase in inventory was a result of the Company expansion plans in Mexico and the U.K. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses as well as the decrease in accounts receivable is primarily due to the timing of merchant accounts in processing at year end compared to the prior fiscal year.Non-cash operating charges for the year ended June 30, 2025 primarily consisted of the release of our deferred income tax valuation allowance, depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of our intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and provisions for expected losses.Net cash used in investing activitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $28.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to $18.6 million in the prior fiscal year. We paid $11.1 million in cash for business acquisitions during the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to $3.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. We invested $17.0 million in capital expenditures as the Company focuses on investing in innovative technologies and products, and increasing rental devices enrolled in the Company's Cantaloupe One program compared to $14.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2024.Net cash provided by (used in) financing activitiesNet cash provided by financing activities was less than $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2025, which was the result of $0.7 million in deferred consideration associated with the Cheq acquisition offset by proceeds from the exercise of common stock options. In fiscal year 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 million which was primarily principal payments on the Company's long-term debt.38CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had certain contractual obligations due over a period of time as summarized in the following table:Payments Due by Fiscal Year($ in thousands)TotalLess than 1 year1-3 years3-5 yearsMore than 5 yearsDebt and financing obligations (a)$47,802 $2,296 $6,765 $38,741 $— Operating lease obligations (b)13,560 2,442 3,903 2,471 4,744 Total contractual obligations$61,362 $4,738 $10,668 $41,212 $4,744 (a)    Our debt and financing obligations include both principal and interest obligations.

See Note 7 - Debt and Other Financing Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements for further information.(b)    Operating lease obligations represent our undiscounted operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2025. See Note 6 - Leases to the consolidated financial statements for further information.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”, "GAAP"), and they conform to general practices in our industry. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and strategic or economic assumptions may prove inaccurate or subject to variations and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. We apply critical accounting estimates consistently from period to period and intend that any change in methodology occur in an appropriate manner. Accounting estimates currently deemed critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations are listed below. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.Revenue Recognition. The Company derives revenue primarily from the sale or lease of equipment and services to the small ticket, unattended POS market.The Company’s application of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements may require significant judgment in contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. The Company assesses the goods and/or services promised in each customer contract and separately identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a distinct good or service. The Company then allocates the transaction price to those performance obligations in the contract using relative standalone selling prices where applicable. The Company determines standalone selling prices based on the price at which a good or service is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through historic data, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by considering all reasonably available information, including market data, trends, as well as other company- or customer-specific factors.Certain contracts require significant contract interpretation to determine appropriate accounting due to complex arrangements with nonstandard contract terms. In particular, the determination of whether the Company is principal (gross revenue) or agent (net revenue) in a transaction can require significant judgment. A change in this judgment could result in a significant reduction in the Company's revenues, but no impact to the Company's net income. Certain contracts also require significant judgment related to the relative standalone selling prices and the allocation to equipment and subscription services. A change in these judgments could result in a significant change in the timing of the Company's revenue recognition.39Capitalization of internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements. We have significant expenditures associated with the technological maintenance and improvement of our network and technology offerings. These expenditures include both the cost of internal employees, who spend portions of their time on various technological projects, and the use of external temporary labor and consultants. Capitalization of internal-use software occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. We are required to assess these expenditures and make a determination as to whether the costs should be expensed as incurred or are subject to capitalization. In making these determinations, we consider the stage of the development project, the probability of successful development and if the development is resulting in increased features and functionality. In addition, if we determine that a project qualifies for capitalization, the amount of capitalization is subject to various estimates, including the amount of time spent on the development work and the cost of internal employees and external consultants. Internal-use software is included within Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is typically 3 to 7 years.We capitalize certain costs related to hosting arrangements that are service contracts (cloud computing arrangements) following the internal-use software capitalization criteria described above. Our cloud computing arrangements involve services we use to support internal corporate functions, our platforms and technology offerings. Capitalized costs relating to cloud computing arrangements are included within Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is typically 3 to 5 years.Significant judgments include whether a project qualifies for capitalization, whether costs incurred directly relate to a project, and the stage of the project's development. There have been no changes in the Company's capitalization judgments.Business Combinations. The Company allocates the acquisition purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. The excess of total consideration over the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. We engage a third-party valuation firm to assist in establishing the fair value of the acquired intangible assets. We may adjust certain fair value estimates deemed provisional as of the acquisition date during the measurement period upon which we may obtain additional information needed to identify and more accurately measure the consideration transferred, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed.Income Taxes. The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies in accordance with applicable accounting standards and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income, as well as management’s judgment regarding the interpretation of the provisions of applicable accounting standards. The carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on management’s interpretations of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the use of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. We evaluate the recoverability of these deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short and long-term business forecasts to provide insight. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.As the Company has recently been profitable, significant judgment is involved in determining if and when the Company's valuation allowance could be released as well as the amount of the release (full or partial). Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards were reserved with a full valuation allowance for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 because, based on the available evidence, the Company believed it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the future. During the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company determined that sufficient evidence existed to release our valuation allowance against federal and most state deferred tax assets. See Note 13 - Income Taxes. If the actual amounts of taxable income differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Sales tax reserve. The Company has recorded estimated liabilities for current and historical sales taxes, which are included in accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On a quarterly basis, the Company accrues interest on the unpaid balance. The estimated liability is adjusted upon the payment of sales tax related to the accrual, the changes in state tax laws that may impact the accrual and the expiration of the statute of limitations for open years under review.Significant judgment is inherent in the methodology utilized to determine the historical sales tax reserve. The liability includes significant judgments and estimates that may change in the future, and the actual liability may be different from our current estimate. 40Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.As of June 30, 2025 we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our outstanding borrowings. Our 2025 Credit Facility matures on January 31, 2030. Interest on the 2025 Credit Facility will be based, at the Company’s option, on a base rate or SOFR plus an applicable margin tied to the Company’s total leverage ratio and having ranges of between 1.75% and 2.50% for base rate loans and between 2.75% and 3.50% for SOFR loans. As of June 30, 2025, we have $39.0 million total outstanding borrowings under the 2025 Credit Facility, an increase of 100 basis points in SOFR Rate would result in a change in interest expense of $0.4 million on our consolidated financial statements. We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our cash investments and foreign currency exchange rate risks on our cash investments, inventory, accounts payable and accounts receivable. We invest our excess cash in money market funds that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term. These investments earn a floating rate of interest and are not held for trading or other speculative purposes. Consequently, our exposure to market risks for interest rate changes related to our money market funds is not material. We have no freestanding derivative instruments as of June 30, 2025.41Item 8.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Revenue Recognition – Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company provides an end-to-end cashless payment solution which integrates hardware, software, and payment processing in self-service commerce. The Company has determined that the sale or sales-type lease of hardware represents a separate performance obligation, the majority of which is satisfied at a point in time as equipment is delivered to the customer. Software and other services represent a separate performance obligation which is generally satisfied over time as the services are delivered to the customer. Payment processing services (or “cashless services”) represent a single performance obligation, which is a combination of services provided to the customer for the ability to accept cashless payments. The single performance obligation is determined to be a stand-ready obligation to process payments on behalf of customers, which is satisfied over time in daily increments. The Company’s customers are generally contracting for integrated cashless services in connection with purchasing or leasing unattended point of sale devices.We identified the determination of performance obligations within revenue contracts as a critical audit matter given the judgment required to determine whether any unusual and/or complex terms within contracts impact the identification of performance obligations and are evaluated appropriately. A high degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company's identification of performance obligations in revenue contracts.43How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition included the following, among others:•We selected a sample of revenue contracts, and obtained and evaluated underlying source documents relevant to the identification of performance obligations. •We evaluated whether the performance obligations were appropriately identified in each of the selected revenue contracts./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPAtlanta, GeorgiaSeptember 8, 2025We have served as the Company's auditor since 2023.44Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmShareholders and Board of Directors Cantaloupe, Inc.Malvern, Pennsylvania Opinion on the Consolidated Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of operations, convertible preferred stock and shareholders’ equity, and cash flows of Cantaloupe, Inc.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPAtlanta, GeorgiaSeptember 8, 202546Cantaloupe, Inc.Consolidated Balance SheetsAs of June 30,($ in thousands, except share

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATIONThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") on a going concern basis. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, have been included. The Company's operations constitute a single operating and reporting segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.The Company has operations in the United States, Mexico and the U.K. The functional currencies of our foreign wholly-owned subsidiaries are the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries into U.S. dollars each reporting period for purposes of consolidation. Assets and liabilities are translated at the period-end currency exchange rates, certain equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates and income and expense amounts are translated at average currency exchange rates in effect for the period. The effect of these translation adjustments are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Convertible Preferred Stock and Shareholders' Equity.Gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in Other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023.Consolidated Statements of Operations: Cost of Sales Below is a brief description of the various categories within cost of sales:•Cost of subscription and transaction fees: Cost of subscription and transaction fees consist of third-party transaction processing fees, interchange fees, and network service fees. Cost of subscription and transaction fees also includes depreciation expense associated with our Cantaloupe One rental equipment program.•Cost of equipment sales: Cost of equipment sales consist primarily of direct costs to acquire finished goods, or for certain products material to fabricate our equipment, as well as freight, taxes, and other inventory acquisition costs.52Consolidated Statements of Operations: Operating expensesBelow is a brief description of the various categories within operating expenses:•Sales and marketing: Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of our sales and marketing team personnel costs. In addition, this category includes fees paid for advertising, trade shows and external consultants who assist in outreach initiatives designed to build brand awareness and showcase the value of our products and services to our opportunity markets. •Technology and product development: Technology and product development expenses consist primarily of our technology and product team personnel costs and fees paid to external consultants relating to innovating and maintaining our portfolio of products and services and strengthening our network environment and platform. These costs include but are not limited to engineering, platform and software development, fees for software licenses, contract labor and other technology and product related items that are not eligible for capitalization. •General, and administrative: General and administrative expenses consist primarily of our customer support, business operations, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative personnel costs and fees paid to external consultants for these respective departments. In addition, this category includes rent and occupancy costs and other miscellaneous costs incurred in the course of operating the business.•Investigation, proxy solicitation, and restatement expenses, net of insurance recoveries: In fiscal year 2019, the Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent legal and forensic accounting advisors, conducted an internal investigation of then-current and prior period matters relating to certain of the Company’s contractual arrangements, including the accounting treatment, financial reporting and internal controls related to such arrangements (the “2019 Investigation”). The Company and former officers incurred additional legal expenses for these periods offset by certain recoveries from insurance policy claims.•Integration, acquisition, due diligence and license application: Integration, acquisition, due diligence, and license application expenses consist primarily of professional services fees including accounting, legal and investing banking advisory fees incurred in connection with acquisitions and post-acquisition integrations. See Note 10 - Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for further information.•Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation expense on our property and equipment, amortization of capitalized internal-use software development costs, and amortization expense on our intangible assets are included within the Depreciation and amortization caption in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Depreciation on property and equipment used for rentals is included in Cost of subscription and transaction fees as described above.USE OF ESTIMATESThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates, judgments, and assumptions in these consolidated financial statement include, but are not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, capitalization of internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements, fair value of acquired assets and liabilities including goodwill through purchase accounting, evaluation of goodwill and long-lived assets impairment, allowances for accounts and finance receivables, inventory reserves, loss contingencies, income taxes, and sales tax reserves. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTSCash equivalents represent all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from time of purchase. Cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts where accounts may exceed federally insured limits at times. The Company deems this credit risk not to be significant as cash is held at well-capitalized financial institutions.53ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLEAccounts receivable include amounts due to the Company for sales of equipment, other amounts due from customers, merchant service receivables which are receivables due from credit card processors, and unbilled amounts due from customers, net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. See "Allowance for Accounts and Finance Receivables" section below for details.FINANCE RECEIVABLESThe Company offers extended payment terms to certain customers for equipment sales primarily under its Quick Start Program. Agreements under the Quick Start Program are accounted for as sales-type leases. Accordingly, the discounted future minimum lease payments are classified as finance receivables current and non-current in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets based on whether the balances due within the next 12 months. Finance receivables or Quick Start leases are generally for a sixty-month term. The Company recognizes a portion of the lease payments as Interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the effective interest rate method. ALLOWANCE FOR ACCOUNTS AND FINANCE RECEIVABLESThe Company maintains lifetime expected loss allowances for accounts and finance receivables based on historical experience of payment performance, current conditions of the customer, which is generally less than one year for accounts receivable and five years for finance receivables. We estimate our allowance using an aging analysis (days past due status) of the receivables balances that is primarily based on historical loss experience. Additionally, current conditions are analyzed to determine if the allowance calculation needs to be adjusted further for any qualitative factors impacting a customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations that is not already reflected through the historical loss analysis. The Company writes off finance receivable balances against the allowance for credit losses when management determines the balance is uncollectible and the Company ceases collection efforts. The provision for expected credit losses relating to accounts receivable and finance receivable balances is recorded within General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.The Company writes off accounts and finance receivables balances when management determines the balance is uncollectible and the Company ceases collection efforts. INVENTORYInventory consists primarily of finished goods. The company's inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using a weighted-average cost method.The Company establishes reserves for slow-moving inventory based upon quality considerations including potential changes in technological standards, historical usage and assumptions about future demand based on market conditions. The reserve is recorded within Cost of equipment sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The inventory reserve was $2.4 million and $2.2 million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NETProperty and equipment, which primarily consists of computer equipment and software and leased equipment, are recorded at either cost or, in the instance of an acquisition, the estimated fair value on the date of the acquisition, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Capitalized internal-use software is amortized on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software. Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the respective lease term. Depreciation expense on our property and equipment, excluding property and equipment used for rentals, is included in Depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Depreciation expense on our property and equipment used for rentals is included in Cost of subscription and transaction fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additions and improvements that extend the estimated lives of the assets are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.54GOODWILLThe Company’s goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of the net assets purchased in acquisitions. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. When we perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. When we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then goodwill is not considered impaired. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which, if any, the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. However, the loss recognized cannot exceed the reporting unit’s goodwill balance. The Company performs an annual goodwill impairment test on April 1 and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company has determined there is a single reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The Company has concluded there has been no impairment of goodwill during the year ended June 30, 2025 based on its qualitative assessment. There has been no impairment of goodwill for fiscal year 2024 or 2023. Subsequent to our annual impairment test, no indicators of impairment were identified.INTANGIBLES, NETThe Company's intangible assets include trademarks, non-compete agreements, brand names, customer relationships, acquired trade names, acquired developed technology and acquired customer relationships in a business combination. The Company carries these intangibles at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which span between three and eighteen years, and are included in Depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.There were no indefinite-lived intangible assets at June 30, 2025 or 2024.The Company assesses its finite-lived intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Fair value of finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment is based on various valuation techniques. If the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets exceeds its net realizable value, the asset will be written down to its fair value. The Company has concluded there has been no impairment of intangible and long-lived assets during the years ended June 30, 2025 or 2024. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSFair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value as follows: Level 1‑ Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.Level 2‑ Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).Level 3‑ Inputs are unobservable and reflect the Company’s assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company develops these inputs based on the best information available.55SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERSConcentration of revenue with customers subject the Company to operating risks. Approximately $28.8 million, $24.6 million, and $28.7 million of the Company’s revenue for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were concentrated with one customer, which represented 10%, 9% and 12% of the Company's revenues for each of the years. The majority of the Company’s customers are located in the United States.REVENUE RECOGNITIONThe revenue recognition guidance provides a single model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue using a five-step model resulting in revenue being recognized as performance obligations within a contract have been satisfied. The steps within that model include: (i) identifying the existence of a contract with a customer; (ii) identifying the performance obligations within the contract; (iii) determining the contract’s transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to the contract’s performance obligations; and, (v) recognizing revenue as the contract’s performance obligations are satisfied. Judgment is required to apply the principles-based, five-step model for revenue recognition. Management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions about the Company’s contracts with its customers, including, among others, the nature and extent of its performance obligations, its transaction price amounts and any allocations thereof, and the events which constitute satisfaction of its performance obligations. The standard also requires certain incremental costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract to be deferred and amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to the customer.The Company provides an end-to-end payment solution which integrates hardware, software, and payment processing in the self-service commerce industry. The Company has contractual agreements with customers that set forth the general terms and conditions of the relationship, including pricing of goods and services, payment terms and contract duration. Revenue is recognized when the obligation under the terms of the Company’s contract with its customer is satisfied and is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.We provide cashless services in exchange for monthly service fees, in addition to collecting usage-based consideration for completed transactions. Certain contracts we enter into with third-party suppliers where we consider ourselves the principal provide us with the right to access and direct their services when processing a transaction. The Company combines the services provided by third-party suppliers to enable customers to accept cashless payment transactions, indicating that it controls all inputs in directing their use to create the combined service. Additionally, the Company sells cashless payment devices, which are either directly sold or leased through the Company's QuickStart, or Cantaloupe ONE programs. The Company recognizes fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of completing a payment transaction. As a principal to the transaction, we control the service of completing payments for our customers through the payment ecosystem. The fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expenses in Cost of subscription and transaction fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For certain transactions in which we act in the capacity as an agent, these transactions are recorded on a net basis. These are transactions in which the customer is entering into a separate arrangement with a third-party payment processor for the fulfillment of the payment service.Cashless services represent a single performance obligation as the combination of the services provided gives the customer the ability to accept cashless payments. The Company’s customers are contracting for integrated cashless services in connection with purchasing or leasing unattended POS devices. The integrated cashless services when combined together are so integral to the customer’s ability to derive benefit from the service, that the activities are effectively inputs to a single promise to the customer. Certain services are distinct, but are not accounted for separately as the rights are coterminous, they are transferred concurrently and the outcome is the same as accounting for the services as individual performance obligations. The single performance obligation is determined to be a stand-ready obligation to process payments whenever a consumer intends to make a purchase at a POS device. As the Company is unable to predict the timing and quantity of transactions to be processed, the assessment of the nature of the performance obligation is focused on each time increment rather than the underlying activity. Therefore, cashless payment processing services are viewed to comprise a series of distinct days of service that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. As a result, the promise to stand ready is accounted for as a single performance obligation.56Revenue related to cashless services is recognized over the period in which services are provided, with usage-based revenue recognized as transactions occur. Consideration for this service includes fixed fees for standing ready to process transactions, and generally also includes usage-based fees, priced as a percentage of transaction value and/or a specified fee per transaction processed. The total transaction price of usage-based services is determined to be variable consideration as it is based on unknown quantities of services to be performed over the contract term. The underlying variability is satisfied each day the service is performed and provided to the customer. Clients are billed for cashless payment processing services on a monthly basis and for transaction processing as transactions occur. Payment is due based on the Company’s standard payment terms which is typically within 30 to 60 days of invoice issuance.Software represents a separate performance obligation, which is satisfied when each distinct day, or for practical reasons, each distinct month of service is transferred to the customers. Customers are billed for software services on a monthly basis. Payment is due based on the Company’s standard payment terms which is typically within 30 to 60 days of invoice issuance. Revenues related to Cantaloupe ONE equipment are recognized over time as the customer obtains the right to use the equipment through an operating lease. Clients are billed for equipment sales on a monthly basis, with payment due based on the Company’s standard payment terms which is typically within 30 to 60 days of invoice issuance. Equipment sales represent a separate performance obligation, the majority of which is satisfied at a point in time through outright sales, or sales-type leases in accordance with ASC 842, “Leases”, when the equipment is delivered to the customer. QuickStart equipment leases are recognized as sales-type leases when equipment is shipped to the customer. Transaction processing revenue is recognized upon the usage of the Company’s cashless payment and control network. Subscription fees for access to the Company’s devices and network services are recognized on a monthly basis when the performance obligation is satisfied.Hardware is available to customers under the QuickStart program pursuant to which the customer would enter into a five-year non-cancelable lease with either the Company or a third-party leasing company for the devices. The Company then allocates the transaction price to equipment and software subscription performance obligations in the contract using relative standalone selling prices. The Company determines standalone selling prices based on the price at which a good or service is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through historic data, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by considering all reasonably available information, including market data, trends, as well as other company- or customer-specific factors. The QuickStart contracts qualify for sales type lease accounting. At lease inception, the Company recognizes revenue and creates a finance receivable in an amount that represents the present value of minimum lease payments. Accordingly, a portion of the lease payments are recognized as interest income. At the end of the lease period, the customer would have the option to purchase the device at its residual value. Any customer payments received in advance and prior to the Company satisfying any performance obligations are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized as revenue is recognized. The Company will occasionally offer volume discounts, rebates or credits on certain contracts, which is considered variable consideration. The Company uses either the most-likely or estimated value method to estimate the amount of the consideration, based on what the Company expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled to on a contract-by-contract basis. The Company will qualitatively assess if the variable consideration should be limited to prevent possible significant reversals of revenue in future reporting periods.The Company assesses the goods and/or services promised in each customer contract and separately identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a distinct good or service. The Company then allocates the transaction price to equipment and software subscription performance obligations in the contract using relative standalone selling prices. The Company determines standalone selling prices based on the price at which a good or service is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through historic data, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by considering all reasonably available information, including market data, trends, as well as other company- or customer-specific factors. The Company’s standard payment terms are payment is due within 30 to 60 days of invoice issuance. The Company uses the practical expedient and does not recognize a significant financing component for payment considerations of less than one year. 57WarrantiesThe Company offers standard warranties that provide the customer with assurance that its equipment will function in accordance with contract specifications. The Company's standard warranties are not sold separately, but are included with each customer purchase. Warranties are not considered separate performance obligations and the related liability is estimated and recorded at the time of sale. Accounts Receivable and Contract LiabilitiesA contract with a customer creates legal rights and obligations. As the Company satisfies performance obligations under customer contracts, a right to unconditional consideration is recorded as an account receivable. Contract liabilities represent consideration received from customers in excess of revenues recognized (i.e., deferred revenue). Contract liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on the nature of the underlying contractual rights and obligations. Contract CostsThe Company incurs costs to obtain contracts with customers, primarily in the form of commissions to sales employees. The Company recognizes as a contract asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if it expects to recover these costs. The Company currently does not incur material costs to fulfill its obligations under a contract once it is obtained but before transferring goods or services to the customer. Contract costs are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. A straight-line or proportional amortization method is used depending upon which method best depicts the pattern of transfer of the goods or services to the customer. The Company’s contracts frequently contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time and overtime. In these instances, the Company amortizes the contract costs proportionally with the timing and pattern of revenue recognition. In addition, these contract costs are evaluated for impairment by comparing, on a pooled basis, the expected future net cash flows from underlying customer relationships to the carrying amount of the capitalized contract costs.In order to determine the appropriate amortization period for contract costs, the Company considers a number of factors, including expected early terminations, estimated terms of customer relationships, the useful lives of technology Cantaloupe uses to provide goods and services to its customers, whether future contract renewals are expected and if there is any incremental commission to be paid on a contract renewal. The Company amortizes these assets over the expected period of benefit. Costs to obtain a contract with an expected period of benefit of one year or less are expensed when incurred.LEASESLessee AccountingThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company has operating and finance leases for office space, warehouses and office equipment. Cantaloupe’s leases have lease terms of one year to eight years and some include options to extend and/or terminate the lease. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. When deemed reasonably certain of exercise, the renewal options are included in the determination of the lease term. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material variable lease payments, material residual value guarantees or any material restrictive covenants.Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the operating lease. Operating lease Right-of-Use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is the collateralized rate of interest that we would pay to borrow over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments, to determine the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Cantaloupe has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. The Company uses the practical expedient related to treating lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases as well as electing a policy exclusion permitting leases with an original lease term of less than one year to be excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 58Variable lease payments that are not based on an index or that result from changes to an index subsequent to the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability are not included in the measurement of lease ROU assets or liabilities and instead are recognized in earnings in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.The Company reviews its ROU assets for events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying amount of an ROU exceeds its net realizable value, the asset will be written down to its fair value. The Company did not recognize an impairment charge related to the right-of-use assets for the years ended June 30, 2025 or 2024. Lessor AccountingThe Company offers its customers financing for the lease of our POS electronic payment devices primarily through our QuickStart program. We account for these transactions as sales-type leases under ASC 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers". Our sales-type leases generally have a non-cancellable term of 60 months. Certain leases contain an end-of-term purchase option that is generally insignificant and is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee. Leases that do not meet the criteria for sales-type lease accounting are accounted for as operating leases, and typically relate to our Cantaloupe ONE rental program. Cantaloupe ONE agreements are 36-month rental agreements that transition to month-to-month agreements after the initial subscription commitment period.The Company also uses the practical expedient related to treating lease and non-lease components as a single component for those leases where the timing and pattern of transfer for the non-lease component and associated lease component are the same and the stand-alone lease component would be classified as an operating lease if accounted for separately. The combined component is then accounted for under Topic 606 or Topic 842 depending on the predominant characteristic of the combined component, which was Topic 606 for the Company's operating leases. All QuickStart leases are sales-type and do not qualify for the election. Lessor consideration is allocated between lease components and the non-lease components using the requirements under Topic 842. Revenue from sales-type leases is recognized upon shipment to the customer and the interest portion is deferred and recognized as earned. The revenues related to the sales-type leases are included in Equipment sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and a portion of the lease payments as Interest income. Revenue from operating leases is recognized ratably over the applicable service period in Subscription and transaction fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Equipment RentalThe Company offers its customers a rental program for its hardware devices, Cantaloupe ONE platform. In accordance with ASC 842, the Company classifies the rental agreements as operating leases, with service fee revenue related to the leases included in subscription and transaction fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Costs for the Cantaloupe ONE revenue, which consist of depreciation expense on the Cantaloupe ONE equipment, are included in Cost of subscription and transaction fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Equipment utilized by the Cantaloupe ONE program is included in Property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.SHIPPING AND HANDLINGShipping and handling fees billed to our customers in connection with sales are recorded as revenue. The costs incurred for shipping and handling of our product are recorded as cost of equipment.ADVERTISING COSTSAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included within the Sales and marketing expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we incurred advertising costs of approximately $3.2 million, $1.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively. 59RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSESResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred and primarily consist of personnel, contractors and product development costs. Research and development expenses, which are included within the technology and product development expenses and general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, were approximately $2.9 million, $3.0 million and $3.5 million, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Our research and development initiatives focus on adding features and functionality to our system solutions through the development and utilization of our processing and reporting network and new technology.CAPITALIZATION OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE AND CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENTSWe have expenditures associated with the technological maintenance and improvement of our network and technology offerings. These expenditures include both the cost of internal employees, who spend portions of their time on various technological projects, and the use of external temporary labor and consultants. Capitalization of internal-use software occurs in the application development stage after the completion of the preliminary project stage, and management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed, and the project will be used to perform the function intended, and it ends at the implementation stage. We are required to assess these expenditures and make a determination as to whether the costs should be expensed as incurred or are subject to capitalization. In making these determinations, we consider the stage of the development project, the probability of successful development and if the development is resulting in increased features and functionality. In addition, if we determine that a project qualifies for capitalization, the amount of capitalization is subject to various estimates, including the amount of time spent on the development work and the cost of internal employees and external consultants. Internal-use software is included within Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is typically 3 to 7 years.We capitalize certain costs related to hosting arrangements that are service contracts (cloud computing arrangements) following the internal-use software capitalization criteria described above. Our cloud computing arrangements involve services we use to support internal corporate functions, our platforms and technology offerings. Capitalized costs relating to cloud computing arrangements are included within Prepaid expenses and other current assets, or Other assets for costs that will be recognized in more than 12 months, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is typically 3 to 5 years.STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONThe cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments related to employees and non-employees is based on the grant-date fair value of the award and allocated over the requisite service period of the award. When the requisite service period precedes the grant date, the Company begins recognizing compensation cost before a grant date is established, and the awards are marked to market until grant date occurs. These costs are recorded within operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.LOSS CONTINGENCIESFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation, claims, contingencies and other legal matters. The Company’s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company's management team evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates a loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed. Expected legal costs associated with assessing or potentially settling a contingent liability are expensed as incurred. 60SALES TAX RESERVE The Company has recorded a contingent liability for sales tax, included in Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On a quarterly basis, the Company accrues interest and penalties on the unpaid balance. The estimated liability is adjusted upon the payment of sales tax related to the accrual, the changes in state tax laws that may impact the accrual and the expiration of the statute of limitations for open years under review. The liability includes significant judgments and estimates that may change in the future, and the actual liability may be different from our current estimate. Changes to the sales tax reserve amount are recorded within General and administrative expenses and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.INCOME TAXESIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method of accounting. Under the asset and liability method, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. The measurement of deferred income tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize future tax benefits only to the extent, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not such benefits will be realized. Tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if applicable, within Interest expense and General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions incurred during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023 were immaterial. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHAREBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income applicable to common shares by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income applicable to common shares by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period plus the dilutive effects of common stock equivalents unless the effects of such common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAccounting pronouncements adoptedIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures which expands reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in the ASU require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to an entity's chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), a description of other segment items by reportable segment, and permits disclosure of additional measures of a segment's profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources. It also requires certain disclosures for companies who have determined only one segment exists. Annual disclosures are required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, which is the Company's fiscal year 2025 annual reporting period. Interim disclosures are required for periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, which is the Company's fiscal year 2026 interim reporting periods. See Note 20 - Segment Information for the Company's adoption of this standard.Accounting pronouncements to be adoptedThe Company is evaluating whether the effects of the following recent accounting pronouncements, or any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This standard was issued to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures to provide information to better assess how an entity’s operations and related tax risks and tax planning and operational opportunities affect its tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. The amendments in this ASU address transparency about income tax information through disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The ASU should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the new accounting guidance will have on our income tax disclosures.61In July 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses for Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets. The ASU introduces a practical expedient to calculating current expected credit loss by assuming that the current conditions as of the balance sheet date will not change for the remaining life of the asset. This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2025 and interim periods within those annual periods, and this update is applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted in both interim and annual periods in which financials have not been issued. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.3. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLEAccounts receivable primarily include amounts due to the Company for sales of equipment and subscription fees to customers, settlement receivables for amounts due from third-party payment processors, receivables from contract manufacturers and unbilled amounts due from customers, net of the allowance for credit losses.

The 2025 Credit Facility provides for a $40 million secured term loan facility (the "2025 Term Loan Facility"), a $30 million secured revolving credit facility (the "2025 Revolving Facility") and a $30 million secured delayed draw term loan facility (the "Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility"). Proceeds from the 2025 Term Loan Facility were used to repay borrowings under the Company's 2022 Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility (described below), which had total remaining net borrowings of $37.3 million, inclusive of accrued interest on these facilities. The remaining proceeds from the 2025 Credit Facility were used to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes including permitted acquisitions and investments. The 2025 Delayed Draw Facility is available for a period of up to 24 months following the Closing Date. The Company has not borrowed against the 2025 Revolving Facility or the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. In accordance with ASC 470, the Company evaluated the 2025 Credit Facility on a lender-by-lender basis. The Company accounted for the 2025 Term Loan Facility and 2025 Revolving Facility as debt modifications. As such, previously unamortized debt issuance costs will be amortized over the term of the new credit agreement. The Company paid $1.0 million in lender fees and legal expenses in connection with the execution of the 2025 Credit Facility. Interest on the 2025 Credit Facility is based, at the Company’s option, on a base rate or SOFR plus an applicable margin tied to the Company’s total net leverage ratio and having ranges between 1.75% and 2.50% for base rate loans and between 2.75% to 3.50% for SOFR loans. The 2025 Revolving Facility also carries an unused commitment fee tied to the Company's total net leverage ratio between 0.25% to 0.40% per annum. In an event of default, the interest rate may be increased by 2.00%. As of June 30, 2025, the weighted average interest rate for the 2025 Credit Facility is approximately 7.24%. The 2025 Term Loan Facility, the 2025 Revolving Facility and the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility all mature on January 31, 2030. Principal in respect of the 2025 Term Loan Facility is payable quarterly with 5.0% due in year one and year two, 7.5% due in year three and year 4, 10% due in year 5, and the remainder payable upon maturity. To the extent funded, principal in respect of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility will be payable on the same terms as the 2025 Term Loan Facility. Principal on 2025 Revolving Facility is due at maturity.67The Company’s obligations under the 2025 Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Company’s material direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”). All obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the 2025 Credit Facility are secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors. The 2025 Credit Facility includes customary representations, warranties and covenants, and acceleration, indemnity and events of default provisions, including, among other things, two financial covenants. The first financial covenant requires the Company to maintain a total leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00 on the last day of any fiscal quarter. However, if a material acquisition occurs, the Company is required to maintain a total leverage ratio not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 on the last day of the fiscal quarter for the next four fiscal quarters following the material acquisition. The second financial covenant does not permit the Company to have a fixed charge coverage ratio of less than 1.15 to 1.00 for four consecutive fiscal quarters. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants for the 2025 Credit Facility as of June 30, 2025.2022 Amended JPMorgan Credit FacilityOn March 17, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which provides for a $15 million secured revolving credit facility (the “2022 Amended Revolving Facility”) and a $15 million secured term facility (the “2022 Amended Secured Term Facility” and together with the 2022 Amended Revolving Facility, the “2022 Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility”), and a $10 million delayed draw term facility, and fully replaced our previous 2021 credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.On December 1, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2022 Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility, dated as of March 17, 2022, which, among other things, amended the definition of the Company’s EBITDA under the Credit Agreement. On December 1, 2022, the Company borrowed an additional $25 million under the 2022 Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility, including $15 million from the revolving credit facility and exercised the delayed draw term facility of $10 million increasing the 2022 Amended Secured Term Facility to $25 million.As described above, proceeds from the 2025 Term Loan Facility were used to repay borrowings under the 2022 Amended Credit JPMorgan Facility, which had total remaining net borrowings of $37.3 million, inclusive of accrued interest on the facility.Interest on the 2022 Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility was based, at the Company’s option, on a base rate or SOFR plus an applicable margin tied to the Company’s total leverage ratio and having ranges of between 2.50% and 3.00% for base rate loans and between 3.50% and 4.00% for SOFR loans. Subject to the occurrence of a material acquisition and the Company’s total leverage ratio exceeding 3.00 to 1.00, the interest rate on the loans may increase by 0.25%. In an event of default, the interest rate may be increased by 2.00%. The 2022 Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility also carried a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on the unused portion.The 2022 Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility included customary representations, warranties and covenants, and acceleration, indemnity and events of default provisions, including, among other things, two financial covenants. One financial covenant requires the Company to maintain, at all times, a total leverage ratio of not more than 3.00 to 1.00 on the last day of any fiscal quarter. The other financial covenant is conditional on a material acquisition occurring: if a material acquisition occurs, the Company is required to maintain a total leverage ratio not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 for the next four fiscal quarters following the material acquisition. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants for the 2022 Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility until the 2025 Credit Facility modification. See above for the new financial covenants.68Expected MaturitiesThe expected maturities associated with the Company’s outstanding debt and other financing arrangements as of June 30, 2025, were as follows:($ in thousands)Amount2026$2,000 20272,500 20283,000 20293,500 Thereafter28,000 Principal amounts payable39,000 Unamortized issuance costs(337)Total outstanding debt$38,663 8.

ACQUISITIONSSB Software On September 5, 2024, the Company acquired all of the equity interests of SB Software Limited ("SB Software"), a United Kingdom private limited company. SB Software is in the business of vending and coffee machine management in the United Kingdom. The acquisition enhances Cantaloupe’s operational capabilities and market reach in Europe. For SB Software, the Company paid a purchase price of approximately $11.4 million which includes cash paid of $10.0 million and the estimated fair value of contingent consideration of $1.4 million. The acquisition was funded by the Company's cash on hand.The $1.4 million fair value of the contingent consideration represented the present value of up to $3.3 million in contingent consideration based on a Monte Carlo Simulation should SB Software achieve certain revenue growth targets as defined in the share purchase agreement. Should these targets be achieved, approximately $1.3 million, $1.0 million and $1.0 million, denominated in British Pounds, will be payable in September 2025, September 2026 and September 2027, respectively. Should the targets be achieved, the Company may choose to pay this contingent consideration in either cash or common stock valued based on the average stock price for the 10 trading days preceding the release of these shares. The Company recognized a $0.6 million gain due to the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration which was included in Integration, acquisition, due diligence, license application expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of June 30, 2025 the fair value current and noncurrent portions of the fair value of the contingent consideration of $0.1 million and $0.7 million are included in Accrued expenses and Other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively.70The following table summarizes the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed:($ in thousands)AmountCash and cash equivalents$284 Accounts receivable94 Inventory42 Prepaid expenses14 Property and equipment67 Operating lease right-of-use assets244 Intangible assets3,303 Total identifiable assets acquired4,048 Accounts payable(71)Accrued expenses(152)Operating lease liability(244)Total liabilities assumed(467)Total identifiable net assets3,581 Goodwill7,793 Fair value of total considerations transferred$11,374 The Company determined the estimated fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired with the assistance of third-party valuation consultants. Amounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets included $3.0 million related to developed technology, $0.2 million related to customer relationships, and $0.1 million related to trade names. The estimated fair value of the acquired developed technology was determined using a multi-period excess earnings method. The estimated fair value of the acquired customer relationships was determined using the distributor method which estimates the value using the cash flow impact in a scenario where the customer relationships are not in place. The estimated fair value of the acquired trade names was determined using the relief from royalty method which estimates the value using the discounted value of the royalties that a company would pay to license the trade name. The recognized intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The estimated useful lives for developed technology, customer relationships and trade names were 5, 3 and 3 years, respectively. Goodwill of $7.8 million arising from the acquisition includes the expected synergies between SB Software and the Company. Goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes, was assigned to the Company’s only reporting unit.The Company recognized $0.3 million of integration, acquisition, due diligence and license application expenses related costs that were expensed during the twelve months ended June 30, 2025, which is offset with the previously described $0.6 million gain related to the adjusted fair value of contingent consideration. These net impact of these items are recorded within Integration, acquisition, due diligence, and license application expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The above table represents the final allocation of the purchase price. Certain immaterial adjustments were made to the allocation of the purchase price. Pro forma financial information of the acquisition and revenue and net income since acquisition are not presented due to the immaterial impact of the financial results of SB Software in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.CheqOn February 1, 2024, the Company acquired all of the equity interests of Cheq. This investment positioned the Company for expansion into the sports, entertainment, and restaurant sectors with a comprehensive suite of self-service solutions. Cheq was acquired for $4.5 million, including $1.1 million in accounts payable paid concurrently with the acquisition. The acquisition was funded by the Company's cash on hand. The original terms included $0.9 million in deferred cash consideration for net working capital and other post-closing adjustments. During the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company paid $0.7 million in deferred cash consideration, which was net of $0.2 million in other liabilities recognized as a measurement period adjustment.71The following table summarizes the adjusted fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of June 30, 2025.

The fair value of the acquired developed technology was determined using a multi-period excess earnings method. The fair value of the acquired customer relationships was determined using the distributor method which estimates the value using the cash flow impact in a scenario where the customer relationships are not in place. The fair value of the acquired trade names was determined using the relief from royalty method which estimates the value using the discounted value of the royalty that a company would pay to license the trade name. The recognized intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The estimated useful lives for developed technology, customer relationship, trade names were 5, 3, and 3 years, respectively. Goodwill of $2.0 million arising from the acquisition includes the expected synergies between Cheq and the Company. The goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes, was assigned to the Company’s only reporting unit.The above table represents the final allocation of the purchase price. For the year ended June 30, 2025, there were no measurement period adjustments other than other liabilities described above. Pro forma financial information of the acquisition and revenue and net income since acquisition are not presented due to the immaterial impact of the financial results of Cheq in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.Three Square MarketOn December 1, 2022, the Company acquired all of the equity interests of Three Square Market, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation, and Three Square Market Limited, a U.K. private limited company (collectively "32M") pursuant to an Equity Purchase Agreement. 32M is a leading provider of software and self-service kiosk-based POS and payment solutions to the micro market industry and the acquisition expanded the Company's presence in that industry. In addition to new technology and services, due to 32M’s existing customer base, the acquisition expanded the Company’s footprint into new global markets. The Company paid an aggregate purchase price consideration of $41.1 million, which consisted of $36.6 million in cash and 1,240,920 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Stock Consideration") with an aggregate fair value of $4.5 million for the acquisition of 32M. The aggregate cash consideration includes $0.5 million of cash paid into an escrow account for net working capital and other post-closing adjustments. The Stock Consideration of 1,240,920 shares ("Escrowed Shares") referred to above were placed into an escrow account to resolve indemnification claims for breach of certain representations and warranties. 50% of the Escrowed Shares were released as of the first anniversary of the acquisition date and the remaining 50% were released on the second anniversary of the acquisition date. The Escrowed Shares were considered to be issued and outstanding shares of the Company as of the acquisition date. The Company funded the cash consideration of the acquisition by borrowing $25 million of debt from the JPMorgan Credit Facility and the remaining consideration utilized existing cash on hand. 72The estimated fair value of the purchase price consideration consisted of the following: ($ in thousands)AmountClosing cash consideration$36,605 Stock Consideration4,506 Fair value of total consideration transferred$41,111 The following table summarizes the final fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of June 30, 2025.

Amounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets included $7.5 million related to developed technology, $7.5 million related to customer relationships, and $0.5 million related to trade names. The fair value of the acquired developed technology was determined using a multi-period excess earnings method. The fair value of the acquired customer relationships was determined using the with-and-without method which estimates the value using the cash flow impact in a scenario where the customer relationships are not in place. The significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of the customer relationship asset and acquired developed technology asset are the revenue growth rates used in the development of the projected financial information used as an input to calculate those values and the discount rate applied. The recognized intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The estimated useful lives for developed technology, customer relationship, trade names were 5, 5 and 3 years, respectively. Goodwill of $26.2 million arising from the acquisition includes the expected synergies between 32M and the Company. The goodwill, which is deductible for income tax purposes, was assigned to the Company’s only reporting unit.For the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized measurement period adjustments of a $0.6 million increase in intangible assets, a net decrease of $0.4 million in working capital, a $0.9 million increase in tax liabilities, and a $0.1 million increase in accounts payable. Recognized goodwill increased by $0.9 million as a result of these adjustments.The above table represents the final allocation of the purchase price.Unaudited supplemental disclosure of pro forma informationThe following table presents unaudited pro forma information as if the acquisition of 32M had occurred on July 1, 2022. The unaudited pro forma information presented combines the historical consolidated results of operations of the Company and 32M after giving effect to the preliminary purchase accounting impact of the 32M acquisition related costs (including, but not limited to, amortization associated with the acquired intangible assets, interest expense associated with the Credit Facility to finance a portion of the purchase price, acquisition related costs) and the alignment of accounting policies. This supplemental unaudited pro forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes and does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been made on July 1, 2021, nor are they indicative of any future results. Furthermore, cost savings and other business synergies related to the acquisition are not reflected in the pro forma amounts.73($ In thousands)2023Revenues$251,979 Net loss(75)The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information for the year ended June 30, 2023 was adjusted to exclude $3.1 million of acquisition related costs, the components of which were previously described.11.

Contract assets that will be billed within the next 12 months are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and all others are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract assets were $3.3 million, $2.6 million, and $0.6 million as of June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.Contract LiabilitiesThe change in the contract liability balances, presented as Deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, isprimarily the result of timing difference between the Company’s satisfaction of a performance obligation and payment from thecustomer.74The Company's contract liability (i.e., deferred revenue) balances are as follows:Year ended June 30,($ in thousands)20252024Deferred revenue, beginning of the period$1,726 $1,666 Revenue recognized in the period from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period(717)(617)Additions981 677 Deferred revenue, end of the period$1,990 $1,726 Future Performance ObligationsThe Company will recognize revenue in future periods related to remaining performance obligations for certain open contracts. Generally, these contracts have terms of one year or less. The amount of revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations in which the original duration of the contract is greater than one year is primarily associated with the Company's Cantaloupe ONE rental program which has a contractual term of 36 months.

Amortization of costs to obtain a contract are included within Sales and marketing expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION STOCK COMPENSATION PLANSThe Company has had three stock-based compensation plans as shown in the table below:Date ApprovedName of PlanType of PlanAuthorizedSharesJune 20142014 Stock Option Incentive PlanStock options750,000 June 20152015 Equity Incentive PlanStock & stock options1,250,000 April 20182018 Equity Incentive PlanStock & stock options10,000,000 12,000,000 As of June 30, 2025, the Company may no longer grant new awards under the 2014 and Stock Option Incentive Plan and the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. Stock options issued under these plans continue through their expiration date which is seven years from their respective grant date.75As of June 30, 2025, the Company had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance for the following:Common StockReserved SharesConversions of Preferred Stock and cumulative Preferred Stock dividends96,137 Issuance of shares to former executive upon the occurrence of a Cantaloupe transaction (1)140,000 Total shares reserved for future issuance236,137 (1)Represents 140,000 shares issuable to our former executive upon the occurrence of a "USA Transaction" as such term is defined in the stock agreement.As of June 30, 2025, the Company had the 3,854,289 shares available for issuance under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan.STOCK OPTIONSStock options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant. The options typically vest over a three-year period and each option, if not exercised or terminated, expires on the seventh anniversary of the grant date.The Company estimates the grant date fair value of the stock options with service conditions (i.e., a condition that requires an employee to render services to the Company for a stated period of time to vest) it grants using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The Company’s assumption for expected volatility is based on its historical volatility data related to market trading of its own common stock. The Company uses the simplified method to determine expected term, as the Company does not have adequate historical exercise and forfeiture behavior on which to base the expected life assumption. The dividend yield assumption is based on dividends expected to be paid over the expected life of the stock option. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined by using the U.S. Treasury rates of the same period as the expected option term of each stock option.The fair value of options granted during the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023 was determined using the following assumptions:For the year ended June 30,202520242023Expected volatility49.5 - 50.5%52.6 - 69.7%74.6 - 77.6%Expected life (years)4.54.2 - 4.54.4 - 4.6Expected dividends0.0%0.0%0.0%Risk-free interest rate3.4 - 3.5%4.0 - 4.4%2.7 - 4.1%The following tables provide information about outstanding options for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023:For the year ended June 30, 2025Number of OptionsWeighted AverageExercise PriceWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years)Aggregate Intrinsic Value(in thousands)Outstanding options, beginning of year3,971,834 $6.63 4.3$3,582 Granted30,000 $6.86 Exercised(111,000)$6.98 $285 Forfeited(13,333)$6.02 Expired(12,667)$7.31 Outstanding options, end of year3,864,834 $6.42 3.4$17,374 Exercisable options, end of year2,966,924 $6.86 3.1$12,317 76For the year ended June 30, 2024Number of OptionsWeighted AverageExercise PriceWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years)Aggregate Intrinsic Value(in thousands)Outstanding options, beginning of year3,873,632 $6.35 5.1$7,595 Granted175,000 $6.92 Exercised(18,334)$6.06 $— Forfeited(29,799)$6.90 Expired(28,665)$4.40 Outstanding options, end of year3,971,834 $6.63 4.3$3,582 Exercisable options, end of year2,602,259 $7.28 3.8$1,085 For the year ended June 30, 2023Number of OptionsWeighted AverageExercise PriceWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years)Aggregate Intrinsic Value(in thousands)Outstanding options, beginning of year3,529,833 $7.41 4.5$194 Granted1,720,000 $4.61 Exercised— $— $— Forfeited(1,376,201)$6.86 Expired— $— Outstanding options, end of year3,873,632 $6.35 5.1$7,595 Exercisable options, end of year1,341,466 $7.26 3.9$1,536 The weighted average grant date fair value per share for the Company's stock options granted during the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023 was $3.10, $4.02, and $2.89, respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested during the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023 was $3.2 million, $4.5 million, and $3.8 million, respectively.COMMON STOCK GRANTS The Company makes annual grants of restricted shares of common stock to executive officers pursuant to long-term stock incentive plans (“LTIPs”) which vest annually, typically over three years.The Company also grants restricted stock units ("RSU") to members of the board of directors as compensation for their service on the board as well as to employees as additional compensation.

INCOME TAXESThe Company has significant deferred tax assets, a substantial amount of which result from operating loss carryforwards. The Company routinely evaluates its ability to realize the benefits of these assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that such benefit will be realized. The Company assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence including forecasts of future taxable income. For the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not a portion of its deferred tax assets, primarily related to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, will be realized. The Company released $46.0 million of the valuation allowance for the year ended June 30, 2025. These U. S. federal and state deferred tax assets were created primarily as a result of net operating loss carryforwards from historical business operations. Key factors supporting the conclusion to release a portion of the valuation allowance in the for the year ended June 30, 2025 included current year profitability, sustained cumulative profitability over the last three years and reasonable expectations of future period profitability both in the near and long term. The Company maintains its valuation allowance associated with the Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards. The provision for income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 is comprised of the following:Year ended June 30,($ in thousands)202520242023Current:Federal$— $(65)$— State(1,368)(729)(92)Foreign— — — Total current(1,368)(794)(92)Deferred:Federal40,092 (248)(62)State3,628 57 (27)Foreign— — — Total deferred43,720 (191)(89)Total income tax benefit (provision)$42,352 $(985)$(181)The components of pre-tax income are as follows:Year ended June 30,($ in thousands)202520242023U.S. income$26,489 $16,217 $996 Foreign losses(4,308)(3,239)(182)Total pre-tax income$22,181 $12,978 $814 The Company considers the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis (including undistributed and previously taxed earnings) of investments in our foreign subsidiaries, as of June 30, 2025 to be indefinitely reinvested in the foreign jurisdictions on the basis of our specific plan for reinvestment and estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Therefore, the Company has not provided for deferred taxes related to such excess or the relevant portions thereof. The determination of any deferred taxes related to this excess is not practicable.79A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 to the indicated provision based on income before the provision for income taxes at the federal statutory rate of 21.0% for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023 is as follows:Year ended June 30,($ in thousands)202520242023Tax at U.S Federal statutory rate$(4,658)$(2,725)$(171)Effects of permanent differencesStock compensation$90 $24 $(688)Other permanent differences$56 $(81)$(497)State income taxes, net of federal benefit$(1,172)$(613)$(296)Changes related to prior fiscal years$(603)$— $51 Changes related to state tax rates$67 $— $(2,455)Changes in valuation allowances$48,221 $2,281 $3,942 Statutory Rates Different from U.S.$262 $183 $— Other$89 $(54)$(67)Total$42,352 $(985)$(181)As of June 30, 2025 the Company had federal, state, and international operating loss carryforwards of approximately $107.5 million, $80.6 million, and $7.8 million, respectively, to offset future taxable income. As of June 30, 2024 the Company had federal and state operating loss carryforwards of approximately $158.7 million and $90.6 million, respectively, to offset future taxable income. The timing and extent to which the Company can utilize operating loss carryforwards in any year may be limited because of provisions of the Internal Revenue Code regarding changes in ownership of corporations (i.e. IRS Code Section 382). Federal, state, and international net operating loss carryforwards of $71.8 million, $9.2 million and $5.0 million, respectively, have indefinite lives and will not expire. The remaining $35.7 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards, $71.4 million of state operating loss carryforwards, and $2.8 million of international net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2025. The net deferred tax assets arose primarily from net operating loss carryforwards, as well as the use of different accounting methods for financial statement and income tax reporting purposes as follows:80As of June 30,($ in thousands)20252024Deferred tax assets:Net operating loss carryforwards$32,435 $37,621 Receivable credit losses1,208 1,367 Inventory reserves614 541 Sales returns and allowances2,410 2,463 Sales tax reserves1,213 1,876 Deferred research and development7,997 5,750 Stock-based compensation4,564 4,327 Lease liabilities2,397 2,410 Other— 346 52,838 56,701 Deferred tax liabilities:Intangibles(3,154)(3,502)Property and equipment(17)(1,179)Right-of-use assets(1,847)(1,954)Other(52)— (5,070)(6,635)Deferred tax assets, net47,768 50,066 Valuation allowance(4,515)(50,532)Deferred income taxes$43,253 $(466)As of June 30, 2025, the Company had total unrecognized income tax benefits of $0.7 million related to its nexus in certain state tax jurisdictions. If recognized in future years, $0.7 million of these currently unrecognized income tax benefits would impact the income tax provision and effective tax rate. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized income tax benefits:Year ended June 30,($ in thousands)202520242023Balance at the beginning of the year$799 $689 $572 Gross increases and decreases related to current period tax positions— — — Gross increases and decreases related to prior period tax positions(112)110 117 Balance at the end of the year$687 $799 $689 The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various states, and international jurisdictions. The tax years ended June 30, 2022 through June 30, 2024 remain open to examination by taxing jurisdictions. While the statute of limitations has expired for years prior to the year ended June 30, 2022, changes in reported losses for those years are subject to examination by tax authorities to the extent that operating loss carryforwards from those prior fiscal years impact upon taxable income in current years. As of June 30, 2025, the Company did not have any income tax examinations in process.8114.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSThe carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, are carried at cost which approximates fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. We have not identified material factors that would significantly impact the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. The Company’s obligations under its long-term debt agreements are carried at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value as of June 30, 2025, as the debt facility was recently amended in January 2025 and the interest rates applicable are variable in nature. The fair value of the Company’s obligations under its long-term debt agreement with JPMorgan and Capital One was considered Level 2 liabilities of the fair value hierarchy because the instruments have interest rates that reset frequently. As described in Note 10 - Acquisitions, the purchase price of SB Software includes contingent consideration which is considered Level 3 liabilities of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs in its valuation.16. SHAREHOLDER'S EQUITY AND PREFERRED STOCKCommon StockThe Company is authorized to issue 640.0 million shares of common stock, with no par value. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote, including the election of directors. The Company had approximately 73.3 million and 72.9 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively, as of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024. Common Stock DividendsThe holders of the common stock are entitled to receive dividends as the Board of Directors of the Company may from time to time declare out of funds legally available for payment of dividends. Through the date hereof, no cash dividends have been declared on the Company’s common stock or preferred stock. No dividend may be paid on the common stock until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock have been paid. 82Convertible Preferred StockThe Company has 1.8 million of preferred stock authorized for issuance which may be issued from time to time in one or more series, each series with such rights, preferences or restrictions as determined by the Board of Directors. As of June 30, 2025, 900,000 preferred shares have been designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The other 900,000 preferred shares have not been designated. Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 0.1988 of a share of common stock and each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to 0.1988 of a vote on all matters on which the holders of common stock are entitled to vote. Series A Convertible Preferred Stock provides for an annual cumulative dividend of $1.50 per share, payable when, and if declared by the Board of Directors, to the shareholders of record in equal parts on February 1 and August 1 of each year. Any and all accumulated and unpaid cash dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock must be declared and paid prior to the declaration and payment of any dividends on the common stock.During the fiscal year 2023, the Company retired 59,281 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock that it purchased for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.45 million. The repurchase transaction was primarily accounted for as an extinguishment of preferred stock and recorded as a decrease to the carrying value of the preferred stock in the amount of $0.42 million and common stock of $1.73 million for an aggregate amount of $2.15 million that was included within the Cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The remaining $0.3 million was deemed to be an amount in excess of the fair value of the preferred stock and was recorded within Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be called for redemption at the option of the Board of Directors for a price of $11.00 per share plus payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends. No such redemption has occurred as of June 30, 2025. In the event of any liquidation as defined in the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, the holders of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued shall be entitled to receive $10.00 for each outstanding share plus all cumulative unpaid dividends. If funds are insufficient for this distribution, the assets available will be distributed ratably among the preferred shareholders. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock liquidation preference as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 is as follows:Year ended June 30,($ in thousands)20252024For shares outstanding at $10.00 per share$3,858 $3,858 Cumulative undeclared and unpaid dividends19,443 18,864 $23,301 $22,722 The Company has determined that its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is contingently redeemable due to the existence of deemed liquidation provisions contained in its certificate of incorporation, and therefore classifies its convertible preferred stock outside of permanent equity. The Company has not made any adjustments to the carrying value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to reflect the liquidation value of the shares inclusive of the cumulative undeclared and unpaid dividends because the Company has determined that a deemed liquidation event is not probable of occurring. Cumulative undeclared and unpaid dividends are convertible into common shares at $1,000 per common share at the option of the shareholder. During the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, no shares of Preferred Stock nor cumulative preferred dividends were converted into shares of common stock.17. RETIREMENT PLANThe Company’s 401(k) Plan (the “Retirement Plan”) allows employees to make voluntary contributions, beginning on their first day of active employment, up to a maximum of 100% of their annual compensation, as defined in the Retirement Plan. The Company may, in its discretion, make a matching contribution, a profit-sharing contribution, a qualified non-elective contribution, and/or a safe harbor 401(k) contribution to the Retirement Plan. The Company must make an annual election, at the beginning of the plan year, as to whether it will make a safe harbor contribution to the plan. In fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company elected and made safe harbor matching contributions of 100% of the participant’s first 3% and 50% of the next 2% of compensation deferred into the Retirement Plan. The Company’s safe harbor contributions for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 approximated $1.1 million, $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and are included within General and administrative expenses within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 8318. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESLitigationWe are a party to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. In accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies, we reserve for litigation claims and assessments asserted or threatened against us when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty.SEC Inquiries and SettlementsBeginning in the fiscal year 2019, the Company received inquiries from the SEC into the facts and circumstances arising from accounting practices in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 ("2019 Investigation"). The Company fully cooperated with these inquiries.

Additionally, in fiscal year 2024,
the Company agreed to an additional net settlement of approximately $1.5 million with a third party insurance carrier related to the reimbursement of expenses associated with the closed SEC investigation.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.On October 10, 2023, the Audit Committee (the “Audit Committee”) of the board of directors (the “Board”) of Cantaloupe, Inc. (the “Company”) approved, and the Board ratified, the dismissal of BDO USA P.C. (“BDO”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and the subsequent interim period through October 10, 2023, there were no “disagreements” (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and related instructions) with BDO on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of BDO would have caused BDO to make reference thereto in its reports on the consolidated financial statements for such years.BDO’s reports on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and the subsequent interim period through October 10, 2023, there were no “reportable events” (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K), except for the material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting described in Part II, Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures,” in the Company’s annual reports on Form 10‑K for the years ended June 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on September 25, 2023, and in Part I, Item 4, “Controls and Procedures,” in the Company’s quarterly reports on Form 10‑Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2022, December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on November 9, 2022, February 9, 2023 and May 9, 2023, respectively. The Audit Committee has discussed the material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting with BDO and authorized BDO to respond fully to the inquiries of Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”), the Company’s new independent registered public accountants, concerning such material weaknesses.Also on October 10, 2023, the Audit Committee further approved, and the Board ratified, the appointment of Deloitte as the Company’s new independent registered public accounting firm to perform independent audit services for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and the subsequent interim period through October 10, 2023, neither the Company, nor anyone on its behalf, consulted Deloitte regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and no written report or oral advice was provided to the Company by Deloitte that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a “disagreement” (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a “reportable event” (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).Item 9A. Controls and Procedures a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)), have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2025.b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingManagement of the Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts based on our best judgments and estimates.87Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025.c) Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmOur independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, as auditor of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025.d) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.Item 9B. Other Information.Rule 10b5-1 Trading PlansDuring the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2025, none of the Company's director of executive officers adopted, modified or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.”Item 9C.

The corporate goals were based on the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA (40%), Revenue (25%), Monthly Recurring Revenue Growth (20%), as detailed in the tables below:MetricGoal WeightingMinimum ObjectivePayoutTarget ObjectivePayoutTarget ObjectivePayoutAdjusted EBITDA(1)40%43,000,00070%47,800,000100%53,000,000130%Total Revenue25%308,000,00070%315,000,000100%322,000,000130%Monthly Recurring Revenue(2)20%10%70%15%100%20%130%Board Discretion15%Not applicable(1)We define Adjusted EBITDA as U.S. GAAP net income before (i) interest income, (ii) interest expense, (iii) income tax provision, (iv) depreciation, (v) amortization, (vi) stock-based compensation expense, and (vii) certain other significant infrequent or unusual losses and gains that are not indicative of our core operations such as (a) investigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses, net of insurance recoveries,

The Compensation Committee believes that these goals are best accomplished by tying a significant portion of compensation to the achievement of performance goals and equity incentives.Emphasis on Equity AwardsIn particular, the Compensation Committee believes that equity awards are an essential component of an effective compensation program because they provide a direct link between our shareholders’ interests and our employees, executive officers, directors, and advisors. The Compensation Committee - and the Board - believe that this link is key to the future success of the Company and have been working to implement changes in the Company’s compensation programs to emphasize equity compensation. A more prominent role for equity compensation in our programs also enhances equity ownership in the Company by our employees, executive officers, and directors, which our Compensation Committee and Board believe is essential to increasing shareholder alignment. The Compensation Committee firmly believes that the Company can best attract and retain key talent by providing attractive “upside” growth opportunity if our leadership succeeds in improving our Company’s past performance, which is directly aligned with our shareholder interests. For further information on our equity award program for our NEOs, please see the below discussion under “-Equity Awards.”Compensation ProcessRoles and ResponsibilitiesCompensation Committee: The Compensation Committee is responsible for annually reviewing and recommending to the Board for approval the corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the executive officers of the Company, evaluating the executive officers’ performance in light of those goals and objectives, and recommending for approval to the Board the executive officers’ compensation levels based on this evaluation.Chief Executive Officer: From time to time, the Compensation Committee may seek input and recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer regarding the compensation of other executive officers; however, the Chief Executive Officer is not present during voting or deliberations on his compensation.Compensation Consultant: Our Compensation Committee engaged Aon’s Human Capital Solutions practice, a division of Aon PLC (“Aon”), otherwise known as McLagan, as its executive compensation consultant beginning during fiscal year 2022. In this capacity, Aon advised the Compensation Committee on the structure and design of our executive compensation program, including the amount and mix of compensation for fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025, on the Company’s comparative peer group, and director compensation.Market AnalysisOur peer group was selected based on industry relevancy with revenue and market capitalization metrics utilized to ensure appropriate size comparisons. The peer group approved and used by the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2025 was made up of these 16 companies:•Atlanticus Holding Corporation•AvidXchange Holdings, Inc.•Bakkt Holdings, Inc.•Cardlytics, Inc.•Cass Information Systems, Inc.•CoreCard Corporation•CPI Card Group, Inc.•Flywire Corporation•i3 Verticals, Inc.•International Money Express, Inc.•PAR Technology Corporation•PaySign, Inc.•Priority Technology Holdings, Inc.97•Repay Holdings Corporation•Sezzle, Inc.•Usio, Inc.Aon provided the Compensation Committee with comparative analyses based on (1) proxy data from Cantaloupe’s identified peer group and (2) industry data from Aon’s proprietary surveys. Market data is used as a reference point and is only one factor in the Compensation Committee’s overall assessment process. Executive compensation levels at Cantaloupe are not directly tied to any specific “benchmark” or other comparative market level. While Aon reports to the Compensation Committee, it also works with the Company’s Human Resources department and senior management to facilitate Compensation Committee work. Representatives of Aon attended and presented its study results, by video conference, to a meeting of the Compensation Committee.The Compensation Committee considered factors relevant to Aon’s independence under SEC and Nasdaq rules and has determined that Aon is independent under these factors.Fiscal Year 2025 Executive CompensationThe summary below represents the Company’s 2025 executive compensation overview.Base SalaryNEOFiscal 2024Beginning-of-YearAnnual Base SalaryFiscal 2025 End-of-Year Annual Base Salary% IncreaseMr. Venkatesan$450,000$450,000—%Mr. Stewart$400,000$416,0004%Mr. Dumbrell$400,000$416,0004%Mr. Singal$362,250$373,1153%Ms. Novoseletsky$325,000$350,0008%Base salary is the fixed component of our NEOs’ annual cash compensation and is set with the goal of attracting and retaining talented executives and adequately compensating and rewarding them for services rendered during the fiscal year. The Compensation Committee reviews our NEOs’ base salaries on an annual basis. Base salaries are intended to reflect an individual’s level of responsibility and performance; however, the Compensation Committee also considers changes in duties and responsibilities, our business and financial results, and its knowledge of market practices in setting and adjusting base salaries.Annual BonusPerformance-based annual cash bonuses based on achievement of pre-established performance goals provide NEOs with an opportunity to receive additional cash compensation based on their performance and Company results, including the achievement of pre-determined Company and/or individual performance goals. Although the Compensation Committee intends that our annual bonus program should primarily rely on pre-established performance metrics and goals, the Compensation Committee also retains flexibility to include discretionary elements in our program so that the program may be adapted to adequately suit its retentive purpose and reflect performance that may not be adequately captured in pre-established, objective metrics.98Annual bonuses for fiscal year 2025 were awarded based on the achievement of predetermined corporate goals and the Board of Directors discretionary evaluation (discretion made up 15% of the predetermined corporate goals). The corporate goals were based on the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA (40%), Revenue (25%), and Monthly Recurring Revenue Growth (20%), as detailed in the table below:ComponentWeightRationaleAdjusted EBITDA40%These metrics appropriately incentivized our NEOs to achieve sustainable growth in fiscal year 2025, while setting challenging goals that, if achieved, would deliver value to our shareholders.Revenue ($)25%Monthly Recurring Revenue Growth (%)20%Board Discretion (%)15%Achievement below the Minimum level as established in the below table would result in a “Percent Achieved” of 0% for the applicable metric. Achievement at the Target level would result in a “Percent Achieved” of 100% for the applicable metric. And achievement at the Maximum level would result in a “Percent Achieved” of 130% for the applicable metric. Each metric was capped at a “Percent Achieved” of 130%. Payouts are interpolated on a linear basis for achievement between the levels set forth in the table. The Compensation Committee selected the Adjusted EBITDA, Revenue, and Monthly Recurring Revenue Growth (the increase in revenue generated from subscription services during the fiscal year) metrics because it believed that these metrics appropriately incentivized our NEOs to achieve sustainable growth in fiscal year 2025, while setting challenging goals that, if achieved, would deliver value to our shareholders. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not required by or defined under GAAP. We use this non-GAAP financial measure for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, which we believe makes it appropriate to use for our incentive compensation plans.

The amounts reported below are based on various assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including assumptions described in the footnotes to the table and the below:•The effective time of the Merger is October 2, 2025, which is the assumed date of the closing of the Merger solely for the purposes of this disclosure;•The employment of each of our named executive officers is terminated other than for “cause” or by the named executive officer for “good reason”, in either case, immediately following the assumed effective time of the Merger;•No named executive officer enters into a rollover agreement;•Each named executive officer’s base salary remains unchanged from that in effect as of the date of this proxy statement;•For purposes of the annual bonus payments and Cantaloupe PSUs set forth in the table, achievement is at the target levels of performance;•No named executive officer has any payments or benefits that would be “excess parachute payments” pursuant Code Section 280G.Named Executive OfficerCash($) (1)Equity($) (2)Total($)Ravi Venkatesan1,350,0001,866,5383,216,538Scott Stewart1,032,000869,7811,901,781Jeffrey Dumbrell416,000869,7811,285,781Gaurav Singal373,118153,776526,894Anna Novoseletsky450,000340,090790,090(1)
Cash. Pursuant to each named executive officer’s applicable employment agreement, the named executive officer is entitled to the         following:•If Mr. Venkatesan is terminated by Cantaloupe without cause or resigns for good reason and within 24 months following a “change of control”, then, subject to his execution of a release of claims and continued compliance with the covenants in his employment agreement, Mr. Venkatesan will be provided a lump sum payment equal to his base salary (without giving effect to any reduction that is the basis for any resignation for “good reason”) plus an amount equal to the last annual bonus paid in the fiscal year completed prior to such termination.•If Mr. Stewart is terminated by Cantaloupe without cause or resigns for good reason within 24 months following a “change of control”, then, subject to his execution of a release of claims and continued compliance with the covenants in his employment agreement, Mr. Stewart will be provided a lump sum payment equal to his base salary (without giving effect to any reduction that is the basis for any resignation for “good reason”) plus an amount equal to the last annual bonus paid in the fiscal year completed prior to such termination.105•If Mr. Dumbrell, Mr. Singal or Ms. Novoseletsky are terminated by Cantaloupe without cause, and subject to execution of a general release of claims and separation agreement, a severance package consisting of six months of continued base salary.106Severance is “double trigger” for Mr. Venkatesan and Mr. Stewart, while the cash payments received by certain of our namedexecutive officers in connection with the Merger, which are repayable to the Company if the Merger does not occur (the "Transaction Bonuses"), and the annual bonus payments are “single-trigger”. Severance for Mr. Dumbrell, Mr. Singal and Ms. Novoseletsky is not single or double trigger as severance is paid for these named executive officers based on a termination by Cantaloupe without cause and without respect to a change in control.The following table quantifies each separate form of cash payment included in the aggregate total reported in the “Cash” column.Named Executive OfficerSeverance($)Transaction Bonus2026 Annual Bonuses ($)Ravi Venkatesan900,000—450,000Scott Stewart624,000200,000208,000Jeffrey Dumbrell208,000—208,000Gaurav Singal186,559—186,559Anna Novoseletsky175,000100,000175,000(2)

Each of these directors also have 19157 RSUs that will vest on May 12, 2025.CEO Pay Ratio DisclosureAs required by SEC rules, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annualized total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, Ravi Venkatesan, to that of our median employee. The pay ratio and annual total compensation amount disclosed in this section are reasonable estimates that have been calculated using methodologies and assumptions permitted by SEC rules.107Median Employee DeterminationWe identified our median employee in fiscal 2025 by calculating the fiscal 2025 cash compensation for all of our employees, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on June 30, 2025. Cash compensation included all cash salaries, wages, and bonuses paid to each employee during the fiscal year.Annual Compensation of Median Employee Using Summary Compensation Table MethodologyAfter identifying the median employee as described above, we calculated annual total compensation for this employee using the same methodology we use in the Summary Compensation Table. The fiscal 2025 compensation for our median employee was $80,000, and our Chief Executive Officer was $957,707.2025 Pay RatioBased on the above information, the estimated ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median employee is 12:1. The pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, due to variances in business mix, proportion of seasonal and part-time employees, distribution of employees across geographies, and the wide range of methodologies that the SEC rules allow companies to adopt in calculating this pay ratio.Pay Versus PerformanceAs required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and certain financial performance of the Company. The following table sets forth information regarding compensation for Mr. Venkatesan, our principal executive officer (PEO), Mr. Feeney, our former principal executive officer, and average compensation related to our other named executive officers versus our Company performance for the past four years.Average Summary Compensation Table Total for Non-PEO NEOs ($)(3)Average Compensation Actually Paid to Non-PEO NEOs ($)(2)(3)Value of Initial Fixed $100Investment based on:YearSummary CompensationTable Totalfor PEO ($)(1)Compensation Actually Paid to PEO ($)(2)Total Shareholder Return ($)(4)Peer Group Total Shareholder Return ($)(5)Net Income ($)(6)AdjustedEBITDA* ($)(7)2025957,707 1,725,357 975,073 1,480,839 56 89 64,533,000$46,740,00020241,046,238 2,137,587 643,599 1,046,244 56 89 11,993,000 33,960,000 20232,802,535 3,627,663 1,131,882 1,422,254 114 131 633,000 17,794,000 2022990,474 (1,989,647)1,086,222 1,326,797 80 119 (1,703,000)9,892,000 *

The measurement date is established by the market close on the last trading day before the beginning of the Company’s third preceding fiscal year.5.The peer group reflects the US Small-Cap Russell 2000® Index, which was used in the Stock Performance Graph included in our Annual Report.6.Dollar amounts reported represent the amount of net income reflected in the Company’s audited financial statements for the applicable year7.The Company has determined that Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is the financial performance measure that, in the Company’s assessment, represents the most important performance measure (that is not otherwise required to be disclosed in the table) used by the Company to link compensation actually paid to the Company’s named executive officers for the most recently completed fiscal year.108 2025202420232022PEO($)Average of Non-PEO NEOs($)PEO($)Average of Non-PEO NEOs($)PEO($)Average of Non-PEO NEOs($)PEO($)Average of Non-PEO NEOs($)Total Compensation as reported on Summary Compensation Table957,707 975,073 1,046,238 643,599 2,802,535 1,131,882 990,474 1,086,222 Fair value of stock awards reported in Summary Compensation Table(172,238)(355,011)(244,148)(117,824)(1,936,233)(669,484)(225,000)(708,513)Fair value of equity compensation granted in current year — value at year-end293,660 557,331 217,166 104,803 1,951,608 676,690 120,691 364,374 Change in fair value from end of prior fiscal to end of current fiscal year for awards made in prior fiscal years that were unvested at end of current fiscal year445,041 219,894 590,771 174,033 644,231 94,484 (2,633,750)502,510 Change in fair value from end of prior fiscal year to vesting date for awards made in prior fiscal years that vested during current fiscal year201,187 83,552 527,560 241,633 165,523 188,682 (242,063)296,817 Fair value as of prior fiscal year-end of awards granted in prior fiscal years that failed to meet applicable vesting conditions during fiscal year— — — — — — — (214,613)Compensation Actually Paid1,725,357 1,480,839 2,137,587 1,046,244 3,627,663 1,422,254 (1,989,647)1,326,797 Relationship between “Compensation Actually Paid” and Performance Below are the graphs showing the relationship of “compensation actually paid” to our CEO and our non-CEO NEOs in fiscal 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 to (1) TSR, (2) the Company’s net income and (3) the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA.

The Compensation Committee’s general practice is to complete its annual executive compensation review and determine performance goals and target compensation for our NEOs, following which they make a recommendation to the Board, which in turn reviews the recommendation and approves equity awards for our NEOs. Accordingly, annual equity awards are typically determined at the first Compensation Committee meeting of the fiscal year and reviewed and approved at the first Board meeting of the fiscal year. These grants are then made effective shortly during a scheduled open trading window. On occasion, the Board may, at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, grant equity awards outside of our annual grant cycle for new hires, promotions, recognition, retention or other purposes. While the Board has discretionary authority to grant equity awards to our NEOs outside of the cycle described above, neither the Board nor the Compensation Committee take into account material non-public information when determining the timing or terms of equity awards, nor do we time disclosure of material non-public information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.During fiscal 2025, the Company did not grant stock options (or similar awards) to any NEO during any period beginning four business days before and ending one business day after the filing of any Company periodic report on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, or the filing or furnishing of any Company Form 8-K that disclosed any material non-public information.Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider ParticipationNo member of the Compensation Committee was, during fiscal 2025, an officer or employee of the Company or any of our subsidiaries, or was formerly an officer of the Company or any of our subsidiaries, or, except as described herein, had any relationships requiring disclosure by us under Item 404 of Regulation S-K of the General Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Item 404”).During fiscal 2025, none of our executive officers served as: (i) a member of the compensation committee (or other committee of the Board of Directors performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire Board of Directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on our Compensation Committee; (ii) a director of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on our Compensation Committee; or (iii) a member of the compensation committee (or other committee of the Board of Directors performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire Board of Directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director on our Board of Directors.Item 12.

Executive officers, directors, holders of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, and any member of the immediate family of, and any entity affiliated with, any of the foregoing persons, are not permitted to enter into a related person transaction with us without the prior consent of our Audit and Risk Committee. Any request for us to enter 112into a transaction with an executive officer, director, principal shareholder, or any of their immediate family members or affiliates, in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 is considered a “related party transaction” and must first be presented to our Audit and Risk Committee for review, consideration and approval. In approving or rejecting any such proposal, our Audit and Risk Committee is to consider the relevant facts and circumstances available and deemed relevant to the Audit and Risk Committee, including, but not limited to, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person’s interest in the transaction.In addition, under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our executive officers and directors have a responsibility to disclose any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to interfere with their exercise of independent judgment or materially impair the performance of their responsibilities to our Board, which shall be responsible for reviewing such transaction or relationship and determining whether any action needs to be taken.Director IndependenceIn determining director independence, our Board reviews other transactions with related persons.
