LOOKING STATEMENTS
When
used in this report, the words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “continue,”
“estimate,” “project,” “intend,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regarding
events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect the Company’s future plans of operations, business strategy, operating
results, and financial position. Persons reviewing this report are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of
future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those included within
the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.
Statements
made in this Form 10-K that are not historical, or current facts are “forward-looking statements” made pursuant to the safe
harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
made. Any forward-looking statements represent our best judgment as to what may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements
include our plans and objectives for our future growth, including plans and goals related to the consummation of acquisitions and future
private and public issuances of our equity and debt securities. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations
that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things,
future economic, competitive, and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict
accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements
are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements
included in this Form 10-K will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements
included herein, you should not regard the inclusion of such information as our representation or the representation of any other person

Our
Company
Hong
Yuan Holding Group (“We”, “the Company”, “Hong Yuan”, Us” or “Our”) was incorporated
on September 29, 2001, in the State of Nevada under the name of Biocorp North America Inc. On March 18, 2005, we filed an amendment to
our certificate of incorporation to change our name to Cereplast, The Company is a development-stage enterprise devoting substantial
efforts to establishing a new business, financial planning, raising capital, and researching products that may become part of the Company’s
product portfolio. The Company has not realized significant sales since inception. A development stage company is defined as one in which
all efforts are devoted substantially to establishing a new business and, even if planned principal operations have commenced, revenues
are insignificant.
History
On
February 10, 2014, the Company filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code
in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana (the “Bankruptcy Court “). On February 14, 2014,
the Company filed a motion in the Bankruptcy Court seeking to convert the Company’s Chapter 11 Case to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case.
On March 27, 2014, the court granted the Company’s motion, and on that date, the Company’s Chapter 11 Case was converted
to a Chapter 7 case. As a result, the Company adopted a liquidation basis of accounting for its discontinued operations, in accordance
with ASC 205-30, “Presentation of Financial Statements – Liquidation Basis of Accounting.” Consequently, the accumulated
deficit generated prior to the bankruptcy proceedings remained unadjusted.
On
January 31, 2014, the Board of Directors of Cereplast, Inc. (the “Company”) approved a 1-for-50 reverse split (the “Reverse
Split) which the shareholders previously approved on April 5, 2013, and previously disclosed on Current Report Form 8-K filed on April
5, 2013.
On
February 3, 2014, Cereplast, Inc. (the “Company”) filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to effect
the reverse split (the “Reverse Split”), effective as of February 21, 2014.
On
March 22, 2019, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada appointed Custodian Ventures, LLC, as custodian for Cereplast, Inc., after
proper notice had been given to the officers and directors of Cereplast, Inc. There was no opposition.
On
June 04, 2019, the Company filed a certificate of revival with the state of Nevada, appointing David Lazar as President, Secretary, Treasurer,
and Director.
On
October 4, 2019, the Company issued 50,000,000 shares of common stock to Custodian Ventures, LLC at par for shares valued at $50,000
in exchange for settlement of a portion of a related party loan for amounts advanced to the Company for $20,100, and a note receivable
due to the Company for $29,900. The note bears an interest of 3% and matures in 180 days following written demand by the holder.
On
April 14, 2020, Custodian Ventures elected to convert the total amount of the 510 shares of Series A preferred stock into 510 shares
of common stock.
On
April 15, 2020, the Board of directors of the Company approved the withdrawal of the certificate of designation of 5,000,000 shares of
Series A Preferred stock filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on August 24, 2012, as amended by the Amendment to Certificate of Designation
after issuance of Class or Series filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on April 13, 2020.
On
May 1, 2020, the Company created 5,000,000 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.001. On May 4, 2020, the Company
issued 5,000,000 shares of the Series A-1 Preferred stock, valued at $5,000, to Custodian Ventures LLC as repayment for funds loaned
to the Company.
A
change of control of the Company was completed on November 3, 2020, when control was acquired through the sale of 50,000,000 common shares
and 5,000,000 in Series A-1 Preferred Shares from Custodian Ventures, LLC to Xudong Li. After November 3, 2020, the Company’s operations
were determined and structured by the new major shareholder.
On
November 18, 2020, the Company filed an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to change its name to Hong Yuan Holding Group.
On
October 1, 2024, The Company entered into an agreement to acquire from Xudong Li (the majority shareholder of the Company) 100% equity
interest of Hongyuan International Holding Group Co., Ltd. (“Hongyuan HK”) in exchange for HK $500,000 (approximately $64,103)
or issuing the equivalent value of the Company’s common stocks, payable upon the completion of changing registered owner with the
Administration for Industrial and Commerce. Hongyuan HK was established in Hong Kong on July 28, 2021.
4
Also
on October 1, 2024, Hongyuan HK entered into a series of agreements including a Shareholders’ Voting Rights Entrustment Agreement,
an Exclusive Management Consulting and Service Agreement and a Share Pledge Agreement (collectively the “Agreements”) with
Fengcuiyuan Chang Technology Development Co., Ltd (“Fengcuiyuan”) and its registered owners (the “Transaction”).
Fengcuiyuan is a corporation formed under the laws of the PRC on September 3, 2021, in which Xudong Li (the majority shareholder of the
Company) controls 95% of its equity interest. Fengcuiyuan owns 98% of Rongcheng (Sichuan) Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd (“Rongcheng”),
a corporation formed under the laws of the PRC located in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, incorporated on April 17, 2024. On November 12, 2024,
Chongqing Xuchang Qingrong Trading Co., Ltd. (“Xuchang”) located in Chongqing, Sichuan, China, was formed as a 55% subsidiary
of Rongcheng.
According
to the Agreements, Hongyuan HK assumed financial and operating control of Fengcuiyuan. As a result, Hongyuan HK has been determined to
have a controlling financial interest in Fengcuiyuan, requiring Hongyuan HK to consolidate the financial statements of Fengcuiyuan and
its subsidiaries, and ultimately consolidate with its parent company, Hong Yuan. The Transaction was accounted for as a reorganization
of entities under common control. As the combining entities have been under common control since September 2021, the consolidated financial
statements of the Company recognized the assets and liabilities received in the reorganization at their historical carrying amounts,
as reflected in the historical financial statements of each entity.
Business
The
Company, through its subsidiary and the Agreements with Fengcuiyuan, focuses on supply chain management services, primarily engaged in
the wholesale and internet sales of fast-moving consumer goods, including food, daily necessities, and electronic products, across various
fields such as pre-packaged food, agricultural by-products, and household goods.
Supply
chain companies help optimize all the activities involved in procuring raw materials and transforming them into products, as well as
managing logistics, storage, sales, and shipping those products to consumers, all of which is done using technology such as artificial
intelligence, IoT, blockchain, and robots.
What
is the supply chain?
The
supply chain is a series of interconnected steps and processes that a product undergoes to reach a consumer, from its creation to its
delivery. It often entails a network of companies and people that are involved in obtaining the raw materials of the product, making
and storing the product and then selling and distributing the product.
What
is a supply chain company?
A
supply chain company specializes in helping other companies manage and optimize their supply chain operations, providing a range of services
to improve their efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and productivity. These include inventory management, freight transportation, warehousing,
and more.

is supply chain management?

chain management is the handling of the production and distribution process of goods and services.
We
develop and operate offline brand-authorized stores, primarily selling a range of Baijiu products at various price points, along with
classic red wine brands, renowned cigarettes and teas, local specialties, beverages, and mid-to-high-end gifts. At the same time, goods

own brand in March 2025, we have established contract manufacturing cooperation with well-known liquor manufacturers and are currently
in production.
As
of December 31, 2024, the store in Chongqing had already opened.
Currently,
the stores in Chongqing and Jiangyou are operational, while the Leshan store is in the process of selecting a site and undergoing decoration.
（Before December 31, 2024, the store will be invested in and hold a 55% stake by Rongcheng (Sichuan) Supply Chain Management Co.,
LTD. In June 2025, we changed our business model. We still fund the opening of stores, but we no longer hold shares in the stores. The
investment funds for the stores will be recovered as loans in the future from the stores’ profits.
Customer
acquisition is a part of our business model. We provide funds to invest in the establishment of stores and are responsible for their
operation. Regional service partners are responsible for finding store partners and store members. During the operation of the store,
we help service partners attract consumers and develop them into loyal members by sharing stock growth dividends, quality commitments,
price commitments, and after-sales commitments, among other benefits. This enables us to gather the basic purchasing needs of members
within the store.

Analysis
of the Current Alcoholic Market and Competition
Channel
Transformation and Price System Impact
1.The
low-price dumping by e-commerce and new retail has squeezed the profits of distribution channels.
First
- and second- tier brands are facing price shocks through online channels. The main reason is that e-commerce platforms (such as Tmall
and JD.com) and chain systems, leveraging their advantages in establishing a comprehensive supply chain system on a large scale, offer
low-price promotions to famous first- and second-tier wines.
2.
Data from 2025 shows that the online sales of alcoholic beverages have exceeded 30-billion-yuan, accounting for 29% of the total industry
scale. The annual growth rate of GMV in live-streaming sales has reached 137%, putting pressure on the prices of traditional distribution
systems and compressing the profit margins of traditional distribution levels.
3.
Third - and fourth-tier brands rely on non-standard channels, resulting in price chaos.
Small
and medium-sized brands generally rely too heavily on live-stream sales (accounting for over 30%) and private domain sales, with fragmented
pricing strategies. This has led to a loss of pricing power in terminal stores, making it difficult to maintain consumer loyalty. For
instance, the online sales growth rate of regional liquor enterprises has reached 2.3 times that of national brands, but they lack a
unified price control mechanism, making it difficult for terminal stores to stabilize their customer base.
Consumption
Upgrade and Evolution of Brand Landscape
1.
The increase in brand concentration squeezes the survival of non-branded products.
The
upgrading of consumption has highlighted the Matthew effect in the industry: In 2024, the profit share of CR6 liquor enterprises (such
as Moutai and Wuliangye) reached 86%, a 31% increase compared to ten years ago. The market share of small and medium-sized brands has
shrunk to less than 15%.
2.
Consumers’ demand for brand endorsement has intensified. Leading brands build barriers through quality and cultural ips (for instance,
the premium of Moutai’s zodiac wine exceeds 50%). At the same time, small and medium-sized liquor enterprises compete in a differentiated
way by relying on the differentiation of aroma types and cost performance (the market size of plain bottle liquor has exceeded 150 billion
yuan).

Terminal
Ecosystem: Survival Pressure and Transformation Challenges
1.
The continuous increase in costs and the lack of specialization have accelerated the bankruptcy and closure of stores. Individual brick-and-mortar
stores are facing dual pressures:
Labor
costs are on the rise: By 2025, the average annual increase in labor costs in the service sector is projected to be 12%. Coupled with
the rent increase, the gross profit margin of individual stores is compressed to 15%-20%.
2.
Backward business model: Over 70% of individual stores are family-run, lacking digital tools and professional product selection capabilities,
and their survival space is continuously narrowing. By 2025, approximately 50.9% of alcohol retailers experienced a decline in sales,
forcing them to transform their channels towards a chain operation and O2O model.
Industry
Volume-Price Paradox: The Truth of Structural Growth
The
alcohol industry has entered a stage of structural growth, presenting a new normal of “volume reduction and price increase”:
high-end positioning and price increase strategies have driven sales growth, with annual sales increasing at a rate of 20% to 30% year
by year. In comparison, sales volume has decreased at a rate of 10% to 15% annually.

Overview
The
Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada on September 14, 2001 under the name Biocorp North America, Inc. On March 18, 2005, it
changed its name to Cereplast, Inc. In the summer of 2014, the Company ceased all operations.
A
change of control of the Company was completed on November 3, 2020, control was obtained by the sale of 50,000,000 common shares and
$5,000,000 Series A-1 Preferred Shares from Custodian Ventures, LLC to Xudong Li. After November 3, 2020, the Company’s operations
are determined and structured by the new major shareholder.
8
On
November 18, 2020, the Company filed an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to change its name to Hong Yuan Holding Group.
On
October 1, 2024, The Company entered into an agreement to acquire from Xudong Li (the majority shareholder of the Company) 100% equity
interest of Hongyuan International Holding Group Co., Ltd. (“Hongyuan HK”) in exchange for HK $500,000 (approximately $64,103)
or issuing the equivalent value of the Company’s common stocks, payable upon the completion of changing registered owner with the
Administration for Industrial and Commerce. Hongyuan HK was established in Hong Kong on July 28, 2021.
Also
on October 1, 2024, Hongyuan HK entered into a series of agreements including a Shareholders’ Voting Rights Entrustment Agreement,
an Exclusive Management Consulting and Service Agreement and a Share Pledge Agreement (collectively the “Agreements”) with
Fengcuiyuan Chang Technology Development Co., Ltd (“Fengcuiyuan”) and its registered owners (the “Transaction”).
Fengcuiyuan is a corporation formed under the laws of the PRC on September 3, 2021, in which Xudong Li (the majority shareholder of the
Company) controls 95% of its equity interest. Fengcuiyuan owns 98% of Rongcheng (Sichuan) Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd (“Rongcheng”),
a corporation formed under the laws of the PRC located in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, incorporated on April 17, 2024. On November 12, 2024,
Chongqing Xuchang Qingrong Trading Co., Ltd. (“Xuchang”) located in Chongqing, Sichuan, China, was formed as a 55% subsidiary
of Rongcheng.
According
to the Agreements, Hongyuan HK assumed financial and operating control of Fengcuiyuan. As a result, Hongyuan HK has been determined to
have a controlling financial interest in Fengcuiyuan, requiring Hongyuan HK to consolidate the financial statements of Fengcuiyuan and
its subsidiaries, and ultimately consolidate with its parent company, Hong Yuan. The Transaction was accounted for as a reorganization
of entities under common control. As the combining entities have been under common control since September 2021, the consolidated financial
statements of the Company recognized the assets and liabilities received in the reorganization at their historical carrying amounts,
as reflected in the historical financial statements of each entity.
The
Company, through its subsidiary and the Agreements with Fengcuiyuan, focuses on supply chain management services, is mainly engaged in
the wholesale and internet sales of fast-moving consumer goods such as food, daily necessities, and electronic products, covering diversified
fields such as pre-packaged food, agricultural and by-products, and household goods.
We
have not yet generated sustained profits from our prior operations. Our independent accountants have expressed a “going concern”
opinion. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $97,784,280 and a net working capital deficit of $243,326.
While
our current burn rate is nominal, it is expected that our costs of operations will continue to exceed revenues, primarily due to the
costs associated with being a public reporting company. Based upon our current business plan, we may continue to incur losses in the
foreseeable future and there can be no assurances that we will ever establish profitable operations. These and other factors raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Critical
Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates
Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.
An
accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that
are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in
the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe
that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements.
Revenue
Recognition
ASU
No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”), became effective for the Company on January
1, 2018 and were adopted using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of the new revenue standards as of January 1, 2018 did
not change the Company’s revenue recognition as there were no revenues during the period.
Under
the new revenue standards, the Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount
that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the
five step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations
in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;
and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.
9
Accounts
receivable
The
Company reviews accounts receivable periodically for collectability and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts and records bad
debt expense when deemed necessary. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers’
inability to make required payments. If there is deterioration of our customers’ credit worthiness and/or there is an increase
in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used, additional allowances may be required.
The Company has no allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Income
Taxes
The
Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for future income taxes. Under this method, future income tax assets and
liabilities are recorded based on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their corresponding
tax basis. In addition, the future benefits of income tax assets including unused tax losses, are recognized, subject to a valuation
allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that such future benefits will ultimately be realized. Future income tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply when the tax liabilities or assets are to be either settled
or realized. The Company’s effective tax rate approximates the Federal statutory rates.
Results
of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2024 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2023
Revenue
was $245,572 in 2024 compared to Nil in 2023. The increase in revenue was mainly due to the consolidation of the Chinese VIEs under common
control which started generating revenue in the second quarter of 2024.
Cost
of goods sold was $152,675 in 2024 compared to Nil in 2023 due to no revenue in the same period last year as explained above.
Operating
expenses were $189,198 and $154,476 for 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $34,722 or 22.5%. The increase was mainly due to
the increase in general and administrative expenses, partly offset by the slight decrease in professional fees. The increase in general
and administrative expenses in 2024 was mainly due to the increase in rent expense, personnel expense, and office expense.
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of $96,437, compared to a net loss of $154,464 during the year ended
December 31, 2023, a decrease of $58,027 or 37.6%. The decrease in net loss in 2024 was primarily due to the increase in gross profit
as a result of the Chinese VIEs starting to generate revenue, partly offset by the increase in operating expenses.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had a cash balance of $46,291 and $5,983 respectively. During 2023 and 2024, the company’s operations
are primarily funded by the Company’s CEO and major shareholder and the minority owners of the Chinese VIEs.
To
the extent that the Company’s capital resources are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements, the Company
will seek additional funds through equity or debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners, licensees or
others, and from other sources, which may have the effect of diluting the holdings of existing shareholders. The Company has no current
arrangements with respect to, or sources of, such additional financing and the Company does not anticipate that existing shareholders
will provide any portion of the Company’s future financing requirements. Mr. Xudong, the CEO and principal shareholder of the Company,
would favorably entertain funding, through loans, corporate expenses for approximately 24 months. Any loans by Mr. Xudong would be on
an interest-free basis, documented by a promissory note and payable only upon consummation of a business combination transaction. Upon
consummation of a business combination, we or the target may reimburse Mr. Xudong for any such loans from funds furnished by the target.
We have no written agreement with Mr. Xudong to advance any further funds for future operating expense, therefore there is no assurance
that such funds from Mr. Xudong will be forth coming, if required.
No
assurance can be given that additional financing will be available when needed or that such financing will be available on terms acceptable
to the Company. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay or terminate expenditures for certain of its
programs that it would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize. This would have a material adverse effect on the Company. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
Operating
Activities
For
the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was $89,582. This was primarily due to the net loss of $96,437,
adjusted by non-cash related expenses including depreciation of $1,356, and then increased by favorable changes in working capital of
$5,499. The favorable changes in working capital mainly resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $36,418,
an increase in tax payable of $4,281, and an increase in due to related party of $37,609, offset by an increase in accounts receivable
of $11,540, an increase in inventory of $44,378, and an increase in prepaid expense and other receivables of $16,891..
For
the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was $111,866. This was primarily due to the net loss of $154,464,
adjusted by non-cash related expenses including depreciation of $1,378, and then increase by favorable changes in working capital of
$41,220. The favorable changes in working capital mainly resulted from an increase in due to related party of $40,484.
Investing
Activities
We
neither generated nor used cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
10
Financing
Activities
For
the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by financing activities were proceeds from capital contribution received
by Chinese VIEs of $130,634 and $106,314 respectively.
Going
Concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying
financial statements, we have incurred net losses of $96,437 and $154,464 for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
and have a working capital deficit of $243,326 as of December 31, 2024, in addition to a stockholders’ deficit of $168,802 which
raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management
believes the Company will continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future and will
need additional equity or debt financing to sustain its operations until it can achieve profitability and positive cash flows, if ever.
Management plans to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for the Company but cannot assure that such financing will be available
on acceptable terms.
The
Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to ultimately attain profitable operations, generate sufficient
cash flow to meet its obligations, and obtain additional financing as may be required. Our auditors have included a “going concern”
qualification in their Report of Independent Certified Public Accountants accompanying our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere
herein which cites substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Such a “going concern” qualification
may make it more difficult for us to raise funds when needed. The outcome of this uncertainty cannot be assured.
The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be
no assurance that management will be successful in implementing its business plan or that the successful implementation of such business
plan will actually improve our operating results.
Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements
We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources and would be considered material to investors.
Inflation
We
do not believe that inflation has had in the past or will have in the future any significant negative impact on our operations.

Changes In
And Disagreements With Accountants On Accounting And Financial Disclosure.
On
May 5, 2024, the Company terminated its relationship with its independent registered public accounting firm, BF Borgers CPA PC (“BF
BORGERS”). On May 9, 2024, the Company engaged Olayinka Oyebola & C0, Chartered Accountants (“Olayinka”), as BF
Borgers’ replacement. The decision to change independent registered public accounting firms was made with the recommendation and
approval of the Company’s Board of Directors.
On
February 26, 2025, the board of directors of the Company terminated its relationship with its independent registered public accounting
firm, Olayinka, and approved the engagement of Aloba, Awomolo & Partners, Chartered Accountants (“Aloba”) to serve as
the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.
There
has never been any disagreement with any independent registered public accounting firm that has worked for the Company regarding accounting
and financial disclosure.
Item 9A
Controls
And Procedures.
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
Based
upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures performed by our Chief Executive Officer as of the
end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have not
been effective as a result of a weakness in the design of internal control over financial reporting identified below.
11
As
used herein, “disclosure controls and procedures” mean controls and other procedures of our company that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”), as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Accounting Officer
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our ICFR based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO 2013”). Based on management’s evaluation under
the framework, management has concluded that our ICFR was not effective as of December 31, 2023.
We
identified material weaknesses in our ICFR primarily attributable to (i) lack of segregation of incompatible duties, and (ii) insufficient
Board of Directors representation. These weaknesses are attributed to our inadequate staffing during the period covered by this report
and our limited working capital, which hindered our ability to hire additional staff. Management has retained an outside, independent
financial consultant to record and review all economic data, as well as prepare our financial reports, to mitigate this weakness. Although
management will periodically re-evaluate this situation, at this point, it considers that the risk associated with such a lack of segregation
of duties and the potential benefits of adding employees to segregate such duties are not cost justified. We intend to hire additional
accounting personnel to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow.
This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding ICFR. Management’s report
was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this annual report.

Item 13
Certain
Relationships And Related Transactions, And Director Independence.
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s current majority shareholder advanced $37,609 to the Company as working capital.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company owed its current majority shareholder of $251,889 including $64,103 for acquisition of
Hongyuan HK, and $150,175, respectively. The advances are non-interest bearing and are due on demand.
Director
Independence
The
Board currently consists of two members, one of whom, Zhang Haosong, meets the independence requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market as
presently in effect.
To
date, we have not adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. The Company
does not believe that a formal written code of ethics is necessary at this time. We expect that the Company will adopt a code of ethics
if and when the board of directors deems it is required.
Our
directors will serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors are duly elected and have qualified. Officers
hold their positions at the pleasure of the board of directors, absent any employment agreement, of which none currently exists or is
contemplated. There is no arrangement or understanding between any person pursuant to which any director or officer was or is to be selected
as a director or officer, and there is no arrangement, plan or understanding as to whether non-management shareholders will exercise
their voting rights to continue to elect directors to our board. There are also no arrangements, agreements or understandings between
non-management shareholders that may directly or indirectly participate in or influence the management of our affairs. Our Board of Directors
does not have any committees at this time.
14
Potential
Conflicts of Interest
Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors or any independent directors on our board, the functions
that such committees would have performed are performed by our directors. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest, as our directors
and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit matters that may impact management decisions.
We have disclosed throughout this Annual Report all potential Conflicts of interest involving the Company’s executive officers
as disclosed in Notes to Financial Statements. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors.
Item 14
Principal
Accountant Fees And Services.
On
February 26, 2025, the board of directors of Hong Yuan Holding Group (the “Company”) terminated its relationship with its
independent registered public accounting firm, Olayinka Oyebola & Co (“Olayinka”). Olayinka was only retained by the
Company for less than a year, and no reports were filed with the SEC. During the period that Olayinka was the Company’s auditor
through February 26, 2025, there were no disagreements with Olayinka on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Olayinka, would have caused Olayinka to refer
to the matter in its reports on the Company’s financial statements for such periods.
On
February 26, 2025, the Company, based on the decision of its board of directors, approved the engagement of Aloba, Awomolo & Partners,
Chartered Accountants (“Aloba”) to serve as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, commencing
February 26, 2025. Aloba is a member of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) in the United States.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Hong Yuan Holding Group
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Hong Yuan Holding Group (the Group) as of December 31, 2024, and the related statements
of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements). The financial statements of Hong Yuan Holding Group (the Group) as of December 31, 2023 were audited
by other auditors whose report, dated April 8, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
In
our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as of December 31,
2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Substantial
Doubt about the Group’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Group will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Group incurred a net loss of $98,844 and has an accumulated deficit of $97,784,280. In addition,
the Group had negative working capital and total stockholders’ deficit of $168,802. These matters raise substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Group’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated
Group’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Group in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Group
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required
to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements
and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.

NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note
1 – Organization
Hong
Yuan Holding Group (“We”, “the Company”, “Hong Yuan”) was incorporated on September 29, 2001 in the
State of Nevada under the name of Biocorp North America Inc. On March 18, 2005, we filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation
to change our name to Cereplast, Inc.
On
February 10, 2014, the Company, filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code
in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana (the “Bankruptcy Court “). On February 14, 2014,
the Company filed a motion in the Bankruptcy Court seeking to convert the Company’s Chapter 11 Case to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case.
On March 27, 2014, the court granted the Company’s motion and on that date the Company’s Chapter 11 Case was converted to
a Chapter 7 case. As a result, the Company adopted liquidation basis of accounting on the discontinued operations according to ASC 205-30
“Presentation of Financial Statements – Liquidation Basis of Accounting”, accordingly the accumulated deficit generated
prior to bankruptcy proceedings remained unadjusted.
On
January 31, 2014, the Board of Directors of Cereplast, Inc. (the “Company”) approved a 1-for-50 reverse split (the “Reverse
Split) which was previously approved by the shareholders on April 5, 2013 and previously disclosed on Current Report Form 8-K filed on
April 5, 2013.
On
February 3, 2014, Cereplast, Inc. (the “Company”) filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to effect
the reverse split (the “Reverse Split”), effective as of February 21, 2014.
On
March 22, 2019, the eight judicial District Court of Nevada appointed Custodian Ventures, LLC as custodian for Cereplast, Inc., proper
notice having been given to the officers and directors of Cereplast, Inc. There was no opposition.
On
June 04, 2019, the Company filed a certificate of revival with the state of Nevada, appointing David Lazar as, President, Secretary,
Treasurer and Director.
On
October 4, 2019, the Company issued 50,000,000 shares of common stock to Custodian Ventures, LLC at par for shares valued at $50,000
in exchange for settlement of a portion of a related party loan for amounts advanced to the Company in the amount of $20,100, and a note
receivable due to the Company in the amount of $29,900. The note bears an interest of 3% and matures in 180 days following written demand
by the holder.
On
April 14, 2020, Custodian Ventures elected to convert the total amount of the 510 shares of Series A preferred stock into 510 shares
of common stock.
On
April 15, 2020, the Board of directors of the Company approved the withdrawal of the certificate of designation of 5,000,000 shares of
Series A Preferred stock filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on August 24, 2012, as amended by the Amendment to Certificate of Designation
after issuance of Class or Series filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on April 13, 2020.
On
May 1, 2020, the Company created 5,000,000 shares of series A-1 preferred stock with par value $0.001. On May 4, 2020, the Company issued
5,000,00 shares of the Series A-1 Preferred stock valued at $5,000 to Custodian Ventures LLC as repayment funds loaned to the Company.
A
change of control of the Company was completed on November 3, 2020, control was obtained by the sale of 50,000,000 common shares and
$5,000,000 Series A-1 Preferred Shares from Custodian Ventures, LLC to Xudong Li. After November 3, 2020, the Company’s operations
are determined and structured by the new major shareholder.
On
November 18, 2020, the Company filed an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to change its name to Hong Yuan Holding Group.
The
Company is a development stage enterprise devoting substantial efforts to establishing a new business, financial planning, raising capital,
and research into products which may become part of the Company’s product portfolio. The Company has not realized significant sales
since inception. A development stage company is defined as one in which all efforts are devoted substantially to establishing a new business
and, even if planned principal operations have commenced, revenues are insignificant.
On
October 1, 2024, The Company entered into an agreement to acquire from Xudong Li (the majority shareholder of the Company) 100% equity
interest of Hongyuan International Holding Group Co., Ltd. (“Hongyuan HK”) in exchange for HK $500,000 (approximately $64,103)
or issuing the equivalent value of the Company’s common stocks, payable upon the completion of changing registered owner with the
Administration for Industrial and Commerce. Hongyuan HK was established in Hong Kong on July 28, 2021.

Also
on October 1, 2024, Hongyuan HK entered into a series of agreements including a Shareholders’ Voting Rights Entrustment Agreement,
an Exclusive Management Consulting and Service Agreement and a Share Pledge Agreement (collectively the “Agreements”) with
Fengcuiyuan Chang Technology Development Co., Ltd (“Fengcuiyuan”) and its registered owners (the “Transaction”).
Fengcuiyuan is a corporation formed under the laws of the PRC on September 3, 2021, in which Xudong Li (the majority shareholder of the
Company) controls 95% of its equity interest. Fengcuiyuan owns 98% of Rongcheng (Sichuan) Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd (“Rongcheng”),
a corporation formed under the laws of the PRC located in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, incorporated on April 17, 2024. On November 12, 2024,
Chongqing Xuchang Qingrong Trading Co., Ltd. (“Xuchang”) located in Chongqing, Sichuan, China, was formed as a 55% subsidiary
of Rongcheng.
According
to the Agreements, Hongyuan HK assumed financial and operating control of Fengcuiyuan. As a result, Hongyuan HK has been determined to
have a controlling financial interest in Fengcuiyuan, requiring Hongyuan HK to consolidate the financial statements of Fengcuiyuan and
its subsidiaries, and ultimately consolidate with its parent company, Hong Yuan. The Transaction was accounted for as a reorganization
of entities under common control. As the combining entities have been under common control since September 2021, the consolidated financial
statements of the Company recognized the assets and liabilities received in the reorganization at their historical carrying amounts,
as reflected in the historical financial statements of each entity.
The
Company, through its subsidiary and the Agreements with Fengcuiyuan, focuses on supply chain management services, is mainly engaged in
the wholesale and internet sales of fast-moving consumer goods such as food, daily necessities, and electronic products, covering diversified
fields such as pre-packaged food, agricultural and by-products, and household goods.
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has not
yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and is dependent on debt and equity financing to
fund its operations. Management of the Company is making efforts to raise additional funding until a registration statement relating
to an equity funding facility is in effect. While management of the Company believes that it will be successful in its capital formation
and planned operating activities, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional equity capital, or be successful
in the development and commercialization of the products it develops or initiates collaboration agreements thereon. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going
concern.

2 – Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis
of Presentation
This
summary of significant accounting policies of the Company (a development stage company) is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s
financial statements. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. The Company has realized insignificant revenues
from its planned principal business purpose and, accordingly, is considered to be in its development stage in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic No. 915 (SFAS No. 7). The
Company has elected a fiscal year end of December 31.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary and variable interest entity (“VIE”)
for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
In
determining Fengcuiyuan is a VIE of Hongyuan HK, the Company considered the following indicators, among others:
1.
Hongyuan
HK enjoys exclusive and non-competitive rights to intellectual property rights and licensing arising from the performance of the
Agreements, and controls and administers the financial affairs and daily operation of Fengcuiyuan. The registered owners of Fengcuiyuan
as a group have no right to make any decision about Fengcuiyuan’s activities without the consent of Hongyuan HK.
2.
Hongyuan
HK is assigned all voting rights of Fengcuiyuan and has the right to appoint all directors and senior management personnel of Fengcuiyuan.
The registered owners of Fengcuiyuan possess no substantive voting rights.
3.
The
registered owners of Fengcuiyuan have pledged their shares in Fengcuiyuan as collateral to secure these Agreements.
4.
The
Agreements are valid for 10 years. Termination is prohibited by Fengcuiyuan and its registered owners, making termination within
the control of the Company.
5.
Hongyuan
HK is entitled to a management consulting and service fee based on the workload and commercial value of the technical services provided
at a price agreed upon by both parties, has the right to adjust the consulting service fee standards at any time based on the quantity
and content of the services provided to Fengcuiyuan. Therefore, Hongyuan HK is the primary beneficiary of Fengcuiyuan.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
significantly from those estimates.
F-7
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
For
purposes of reporting within the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all cash on hand, cash accounts not subject to withdrawal
restrictions or penalties, and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash
equivalents.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major repairs and betterments that significantly extend original useful
lives or improve productivity are capitalized and depreciated over the period benefited. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line
method for substantially all assets with estimated lives as follows:

Lease
ASC
Topic 842, “Leases” requires recognition of leases on the balance sheets as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets
and lease liabilities. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use underlying assets for the lease terms and lease liabilities
represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease
liabilities are recognized based on the present value and future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The
Company’s future minimum lease payments used to determine the Company’s lease liabilities mainly include minimum lease rent
payments. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded on the Company’s balance sheet and are expensed
on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the Company’s statement of operations. As most of the Company’s leases do
not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement
date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based
on its understanding of what its credit rating would be.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). ASC
718 addresses all forms of share-based payment (“SBP”) awards including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans
and stock incentive shares. Under ASC 718 awards result in a cost that is measured at fair value on the awards’ grant date, based
on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest and will result in a charge to operations.
Loss
per Share
Basic
earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased
to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and
if the additional common shares were dilutive. The Company’s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for
the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, as there are no potential shares outstanding that would have a dilutive effect.
Income
Taxes
Income
tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences
of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The Company recorded a valuation allowance against
its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The
Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The
first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more
likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The
Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment (or receipt)
of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes.

9 – Income Taxes
The
Company is subject to taxation in the United States (USA) and its subsidiaries were incorporated in China and are governed by the Income
Tax Law of China.
Deferred
taxes represent the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes. Temporary differences result primarily from the recording of tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards.
As
of December 31, 2024, the Company has an insufficient history to support the likelihood of ultimate realization of the benefit associated
with the deferred tax asset. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset.
The
provision for income taxes consists of the following:
