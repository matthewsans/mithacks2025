BusinessAviat Networks, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a global supplier of microwave networking and wireless access networking solutions, backed by an extensive suite of professional services and support. Aviat Networks, Inc. may be referred to as “the Company,” “AVNW,” “Aviat Networks,” “Aviat,” “we,” “us” and “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Aviat was incorporated in Delaware in 2006 to combine the businesses of Harris Corporation’s Microwave Communications Division (“MCD”) and Stratex Networks, Inc. (“Stratex”). On January 28, 2010, we changed our corporate name from Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. to Aviat Networks, Inc.Aviat’s principal executive offices are located at 200 Parker Dr., Suite C100A, Austin, Texas 78728, and its telephone number is (408) 941-7100. Aviat’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol AVNW. As of June 27, 2025, the Company had 923 employees.Overview and Description of the BusinessWe design, manufacture and sell a range of wireless transport and access networking products, solutions and services to two principal customer types. 1.Communications Service Providers (“CSPs”): These include mobile and fixed telecommunications network operators, broadband and internet service providers and network operators which generate revenues from the communications services that they provide.2.Private network operators: These are customers which do not resell communications services but build networks for reasons of economics, autonomy, and/or security to support a wide variety of mission critical performance applications. Examples include federal, state and local government agencies, transportation agencies, energy and utility companies, public safety agencies and broadcast network operators around the world. We sell products and services directly to our customers, and, to a lesser extent, agents and resellers.Our products utilize microwave and millimeter wave technologies to create point to point and point to multi-point wireless links for short, medium and long-distance interconnections. In addition to our wireless products, we also provide routers and a range of premise and hosted private cloud-based software tools and applications to enable deployment, monitoring, network management, and optimization and operational assurance of our systems as well as to automate network design and procurement. We also source, qualify, supply, integrate, test and support third party equipment such as antennas, power supplies, optical transmission equipment and other equipment necessary to build and deploy a complete telecommunications transmission network. We provide a full suite of professional services for planning, deployment, operations, optimization and maintenance of our customers’ networks.Our wireless systems deliver urban, suburban, regional and country-wide communications links as the primary alternative to fiber optic, low earth orbit satellite and copper connections. Fiber optic connections are the primary connectivity alternative to wireless systems. In dense urban and suburban areas, wireless solutions can be faster to deploy and lower cost per mile than new fiber deployments. In developing nations, fiber infrastructure is often scarce and as a result wireless systems are used for both long and short distance connections. Wireless systems also have advantages over optical fiber in areas with rugged terrain, and to provide connections over bodies of water such as between islands or to offshore oil and gas production platforms. Through the air wireless transmission is also inherently lower in latency than transmission through optical cables and can be leveraged in time sensitive networking applications, such as high frequency trading. Our wireless access solutions provide cost-effective alternatives to provide connectivity to private network infrastructure, including smart cities, smart grid, distribution automation, metering and renewables, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and telemetry, as well as vehicle and fleet connectivity.5Revenue from our North America and international regions represented approximately 48% and 52% of our revenue in fiscal 2025, 50% and 50% of our revenue in fiscal 2024, and 58% and 42% of our revenue in fiscal 2023, respectively. Information about our revenue attributable to our geographic regions is set forth in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in “Note 10. Segment and Geographic Information” of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Market OverviewWe believe that future demand for microwave and millimeter wave transmission systems will be influenced by a number of factors across several market segments. Mobile/5G NetworksAs mobile networks evolve, expand, densify, add subscribers, and increase the number of wirelessly connected devices, sensors and machines, investment in backhaul infrastructure is required. Whether mobile network operators choose to self-build this backhaul infrastructure, or lease backhaul services from other network providers, we expect that the evolution of mobile networks will continue to drive demand for microwave and millimeter wave wireless backhaul transmission technologies. Within this overall scope, there are multiple individual drivers for investment in backhaul infrastructure.•5G Deployments. Mobile Radio Access Network (“RAN”) technologies are evolving. With the evolution from 4G (HSPA+ and LTE) to 5G, and now with 6G on the horizon, technology is rapidly advancing and providing subscribers with higher speed access to the Internet, social media, and video streaming services. The dramatic increase in data to be transported through the RAN and across the backhaul infrastructure drives requirements for higher data transport links necessitating upgrades to or replacement of the existing backhaul infrastructure.•Subscriber Growth. Traffic on the backhaul infrastructure increases as the number of unique subscribers grows.•Connected Devices. The number of devices such as smart phones and tablets connected to the mobile network is far greater than the number of unique subscribers and is continuing to grow as consumers adopt multiple mobile device types. There is also rapid growth in the number and type of wireless enabled sensors and machines being connected to the mobile network creating new revenue streams for network operators in healthcare, agriculture, transportation and education. As a result, the data traffic crossing the backhaul infrastructure continues to grow.•IoT. The Internet of Things (“IoT”) brings the potential of massive deployment of wireless end points for sensing and reporting data and remotely controlling machines and devices. The increase of data volume drives investment in network infrastructure.•Network Densification. RAN frequency spectrum is a limited resource and shared between the devices and users within the coverage area of each base station. Meeting the combined demand of increasing subscribers and devices will require the deployment of much higher densities of base stations with reduced coverage (small cells) each requiring interconnection and proportionally driving increased demand for wireless backhaul and or fronthaul solutions as the primary alternative to optical fiber connectivity.•Geographic Coverage. Expanding the geographic area covered by a mobile network to areas that are unserved or underserved by broadband services requires the deployment of additional cellular base station sites. Each additional base station site also needs to be connected to the core of the mobile network through expansion of the backhaul system.•License Mandates. Mobile Operators are licensed telecommunications service providers. Licenses will typically mandate a minimum geographic footprint within a specific period of time and/or a minimum proportion of a national or regional population served. This can outpace backhaul infrastructure investment and cause periodic spikes in demand.Rural Broadband•Middle Mile. Aviat transport equipment is used to deliver broadband connectivity to rural and suburban communities as an alternative to costly fiber. There are significant investments being made to improve rural household and enterprise connectivity and many of these investments target middle mile infrastructure builds. •Expansion of Offered Services. Internet service providers, especially those in emerging markets, now own and operate the most modern communications networks within their respective regions. These network assets can be further leveraged to provide high speed broadband services to fixed locations such as small, medium and large business enterprises, airports, hotels, hospitals, and educational institutions. Microwave and millimeter wave backhaul is ideally suited to providing high speed broadband connections to these end points due to the lack of fiber infrastructure.6Private NetworksIn addition to mobile backhaul, we see demand for microwave technology in other vertical markets, including utility, public safety, energy and mining, government, financial institutions and broadcast.•Many utility companies around the world are actively investing in “Smart Grid” solutions and energy demand management, which drive the need for network modernization and increased capacity of networks.•The investments in network modernization in the public safety market can significantly enhance the capabilities of security agencies. Improving border patrol effectiveness, enabling inter-operable emergency communications services for local or state police, providing access to timely information from centralized databases, or utilizing video and imaging devices at the scene of an incident requires a high bandwidth and reliable network. The mission critical nature of public safety and national security networks can require that these networks are built, operated and maintained independently of other network infrastructure. Microwave is well suited to this environment because it is a cost-effective alternative to fiber.•Microwave technology can be used to engineer long distance and more direct connections than optical cable. Microwave signals also travel through the air much faster than light through glass and the combined effect of shorter distance and higher speed reduces latency, which is valued for trading applications in the financial industry. Our products have already been used to create low latency connections between major centers in the United States (“U.S.”), Europe and Asia and we see long-term interest in the creation of further low latency routes in various geographies around the world.•Evolution to IP (internet protocol). Network Infrastructure capacity, efficiency and flexibility is greatly enhanced by transitioning from legacy SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) / SONET (synchronous optical network) / TDM (time division multiplexing) to IP infrastructure. Our products offer integrated IP transport and routing functionality, increasing the value they bring in the backhaul network. •The enhancement of border security and surveillance networks to counter terrorism and insurgency is aided by the use of wireless technologies including microwave backhaul.•The expected growth of remote and industrial access applications to support the evolution of smart networks for cities, oilfields, mines and remote rural broadband connectivity using fixed, nomadic and mobile wireless technologies, particularly where a high degree of environmental resilience and ruggedness is required.These factors are combining to create a range of opportunities for continued investment in backhaul, transport and access networks that favor microwave and millimeter wave technologies. As we focus on executing future generations of our technology, our goal is to make wireless technology a viable choice for an ever-broadening range of network types.StrategyWe are engaging with customers on the evolution of use cases and applications as 5G mobile and broadband networks edge closer to implementation and begin to factor more strongly in the vendor selection process. We are confident in our ability to address current and future 5G market needs.We are focused on building a sustainable and profitable business with growth potential. We have invested in our people and processes to create a platform for operational excellence across sales, services, product development and supply chain areas while continuing to make investments in strengthening our product and services portfolio and expanding our reach into targeted market areas.Our strategy has three main elements aligned to deliver a compelling Total Cost of Ownership (“TCO”) value proposition. The first is our portfolio of wireless transport and access products allowing our customers to increase capacity and flexibility with a much better total cost solution. We are expanding the data-carrying capacity of our wireless products to address the increasing data demand in networks of all types, while reducing overall energy consumption. Our research and development is focused on innovations that increase capacity, reduce energy consumption and lower overall TCO.Second, to address the operational complexity of planning, deploying, owning and operating wireless networks, we are investing in a combination of software applications, tools and services where simplification, process automation, optimization and performance assurance, combined with our unique expertise in wireless technology can make a significant difference for our customers and partners. 7Finally, Aviat is investing in e-commerce through our online platform, the “Aviat Store” and supporting supply chain capabilities. Aviat can better service customers buying through the Aviat Store with lower costs, faster lead times and a simpler purchasing experience. The Aviat Store, together with our supply chain, enables customers (including ISP, Tier 2 and mobile 5G operators) to purchase products as needed, thus avoiding lengthy and variable lead times that come with other vendor solutions and allowing those customers to lower warehousing costs, reduce obsolete equipment, and lower the cost of capital by paying only when equipment is needed.We continue to develop our professional services portfolio as key to our long-term strategy and differentiation. We offer a portfolio of hosted expert services, and we continue to offer training and accreditation programs for microwave and IP network design, deployment and maintenance.We expect to continue to serve and expand our existing customer base and develop business with new customers. We intend to leverage our customer base, longstanding presence in many countries, distribution channels, comprehensive product line, superior customer service and our turnkey solution capability to continue to sell existing and new products and services to current and future customers.Products and SolutionsOur product and solutions portfolio is key to building and maintaining our base of customers.

Our services cover the entire evaluation, purchase, deployment and operational cycle and enable us to be one of the few complete, turnkey solution providers in the industry.Business OperationsSales and ServiceOur primary route to market is through our own direct sales, service and support organization. This provides us with the best opportunity to leverage our role as a technology specialist and differentiate ourselves from competitors. Our focus on key customers and geographies allows us to consistently achieve a high level of customer retention and repeat business. Our highest concentrations of sales and service resources are in the United States, Western and Southern Africa, the Philippines, and the European Union. We maintain a presence in a number of other countries, some of which are based in customer locations and include, but not limited to, Canada, Mexico, Kenya, India, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.In addition to our direct channel to market, we have relationships with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and system integrators especially focused towards large and complex projects in national security and government-related applications. Our role in these relationships ranges from equipment supply only to being a sub-contractor for a portion of the project scope where we will supply equipment and a variety of design, deployment and maintenance services.We also use indirect sales channels, including dealers, resellers and sales representatives, in the marketing and sale of some lines of products and equipment on a global basis. These independent representatives may buy for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or governmental customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or established by the independent representative and may be above or below our list prices. These independent representatives generally receive a discount on our list prices and are free to set the final sales prices paid by the customer.We have a direct online sales option through our online “Aviat Store”. The Aviat Store targets customers with a traditional high cost to serve via traditional channels. We provide online design tools for radio link planning and online ordering tools, which we fulfill directly from our Aviat Store with multiple options of product available for next day shipment.We have repair and service centers in the Philippines and the United States. We have customer service and support personnel who provide customers with training, installation, technical support, maintenance and other services on systems under contract. We install and maintain customer equipment directly, in some cases, and contract with third-party service providers in other cases.The specific terms and conditions of our product warranties vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business. On direct sales, warranty periods generally start on the delivery date and continue for one to three years.9ManufacturingOur global manufacturing strategy follows an outsourced manufacturing model using contract manufacturing partners in Asia and the United States. Our strategy is based on balancing cost and supplier performance as well as taking into account qualification for localization requirements of certain market segments, such as the Buy American Act. All manufacturing operations have been certified to International Standards Organization 9001, a recognized international quality standard. We have also been certified to the TL 9000 standard, a telecommunication industry-specific quality system standard.BacklogOur backlog was approximately $323 million as of June 27, 2025, and $292 million as of June 28, 2024, consisting primarily of contracts or purchase orders for both product and service deliveries and extended service warranties. Services include management’s initial estimate of the value of a customer’s commitment under a services contract. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a customer’s commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind down costs. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as backlog only to the extent of the new incremental value. We regularly review our backlog to ensure that our customers continue to honor their purchase commitments and have the financial means to purchase and deploy our products and services in accordance with the terms of their purchase contracts. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidation, adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency.We expect to substantially deliver against the backlog as of June 27, 2025, during fiscal 2026, but we cannot be assured that this will occur. Product orders in our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the option of the purchaser without significant penalty as well as long-term projects that could take more than a year to complete. Accordingly, although useful for scheduling production, backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period because of the timing of orders, delivery intervals, customer and product mix and the possibility of changes in delivery schedules and additions or cancellations of orders. CustomersAlthough we have a large customer base, during any given fiscal year or quarter, a small number of customers may account for a significant portion of our revenue.During fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, no customers accounted for more than 10% of total revenue.CompetitionThe microwave and millimeter-wave wireless networking business is a competitive and specialized segment of the telecommunications industry that is sensitive to technological advancements. Our principal competitors include business units of large mobile and IP network infrastructure manufacturers such as Ericsson, Huawei, ZTE, Nokia Corporation and GE Vernova, as well as a number of smaller transport and access specialist companies such as Ceragon Networks Ltd., Cambium Networks Corporation, RACOM and Airspan Networks. We also compete with fiber optic cable and low earth orbit satellites for networking connections.Some of our larger competitors may have greater name recognition, broader product lines (some including non-wireless telecommunications equipment and managed services), a larger installed base of products and longer-standing customer relationships. They may from time to time leverage their extensive overall portfolios into completely outsourced and managed network offerings restricting opportunities for specialist suppliers. In addition, some competitors may offer seller financing, which can be a competitive advantage under certain economic climates.Some of our larger competitors may also act as systems integrators through which we sometimes distribute and sell products and services to end users.The smaller independent private and public specialist competitors typically leverage new technologies and low product costs but are generally less capable of offering a complete solution including professional services, especially in the North America and Africa regions which form the majority of our addressed market. 10We concentrate on market opportunities that we believe are compatible with our resources, overall technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive factors are unique differentiators, TCO, product quality and reliability, technological capabilities, service, ability to meet delivery schedules and the effectiveness of dealers in international areas. We believe that the combination of our network and systems engineering support and service, global reach, technological innovation, agility and close collaborative relationships with our customers are the key competitive strengths for us. However, customers may still make decisions based primarily on factors such as price, financing terms and/or past or existing relationships, where it may be difficult for us to compete effectively or profitably.Research and DevelopmentWe believe that our ability to enhance our current products, develop and introduce new products on a timely basis, maintain technological competitiveness and meet customer requirements is essential to our success. Accordingly, we allocate, and intend to continue to allocate, a significant portion of our resources to research and development efforts in key technology areas and innovation to differentiate our overall portfolio from our competition. The majority of such research and development resources will be focused on technologies in microwave and millimeter wave RF, digital signal processing, networking protocols and software applications.Our research and development expenditures totaled $35.8 million, or 8.2% of revenue, in fiscal 2025, $36.4 million, or 8.9% of revenue, in fiscal 2024, and $24.9 million, or 7.2% of revenue, in fiscal 2023.Research and development are primarily directed to the development of new products and to build technological capability. We are an industry innovator and intend to continue to focus significant resources on product development in an effort to maintain our competitiveness and support our entry into new markets. Our product development teams totaled 225 employees as of June 27, 2025, and were located primarily Slovenia and New Zealand.Raw Materials and SuppliesBecause of our range of products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use numerous sources of raw materials needed for our operations and for our products, such as electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and plastics. We are dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors for a large number of components and subsystems and upon the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to adhere to customers’ requirements or regulatory restrictions and to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules.Our strategy for procuring raw material and supplies includes dual sourcing (where possible) on strategic assemblies and components. In general, we believe this reduces our risk with regard to the potential financial difficulties in our supply base. In some instances, we are dependent upon one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature of a particular item or because of local content preference requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project. Examples of sole or limited source categories include metal fabrications and castings, for which we own the tooling and therefore limit our supplier relationships, and ASIC’s and MMICs (types of integrated circuit used in manufacturing microwave radios), which we procure at volume discount from a single source.Patents and Other Intellectual PropertyWe consider our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, in the aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We own a portfolio of patents, trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property. As of June 27, 2025, we (collectively with our subsidiaries) own approximately 244 U.S. patents and 159 international patents and had 8 U.S. patent applications pending and 8 international patent applications pending. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and international equivalent bodies have not yet concluded substantive examination of our pending patent applications. Therefore, it is unclear what scope of additional patent coverage, if any, will eventually be provided as a result of those pending applications. Failure to obtain comprehensive patent coverage could impair our ability to prevent competitors from replicating some portions or all of our products. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. The costs we pay or revenue we receive from such licenses may be dependent on certain factors, such as the market for such licenses and whether such licenses can be negotiated on commercially acceptable terms. However, we do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any single patent, license or other intellectual property right.11Further, changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property and may increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. In addition, Congress or other foreign legislative bodies may pass patent reform legislation that is unfavorable to us. For example, the United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained. Depending on decisions by the United States Congress, the United States federal courts, the USPTO, or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and the patents we might obtain or license in the future.Our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. There can be no assurance that competitors will not infringe our trademarks, that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks or that any of our current or future trademark applications will be approved. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections and, although we are given an opportunity to respond, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in proceedings before the USPTO and in proceedings before comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, trademarks are examined for registrability against prior pending and registered third-party trademarks, and third parties are given an opportunity to oppose registration of pending trademark applications and/or to seek cancellation of registered trademarks. Applications to register our trademarks may be finally rejected, and opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, which may necessitate a change in branding strategy if such rejections and proceedings cannot be overcome or resolved.Additionally, competitors may try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. As a result, from time to time, we might engage in litigation to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or defend against claims of alleged infringement asserted by third parties. Any of our patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide competitive advantages. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be sufficient or effective to prevent the unauthorized access, use, copying, or the reverse engineering of our technology and other intellectual property, including by third parties who may use our technology or other proprietary information to develop products and services that compete with ours. Additionally, policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights can be difficult, costly and time consuming. The enforcement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights also depends on any legal actions we may bring against any such parties being successful, but these actions are costly, time-consuming, and may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated. Furthermore, our competitors or other third parties may assert that our products infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. Successful claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by a third party could prevent us from offering certain products or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and expense, and at which time we could be unable to continue to offer our affected products or solutions, or require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees.In addition, to protect our confidential information, including our trade secrets, we require our employees and contractors to sign confidentiality and invention assignment agreements. We also enter into non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers and appropriate customers to limit their access to and disclosure of our proprietary information.Although our ability to compete may be affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information, we believe that, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the wireless telecommunications industry, our innovative skills, technical expertise and ability to introduce new products on a timely basis is just as important in maintaining our competitive position as protecting our intellectual property. Trade secret, trademark, copyright and patent protections are important but must be supported by other factors such as the expanding knowledge, ability and experience of our personnel, new product introductions and product enhancements. Although we have and will continue to implement protective measures and intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful.12Environmental and Other RegulationsOur facilities and operations, in common with those of our industry in general, are subject to numerous domestic and international laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, increase transparency or modify corporate behavior, particularly with regard to waste and emissions. We believe that we have substantially complied with these requirements and that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Based upon currently available information, we do not expect expenditures to protect the environment and to comply with current environmental laws and regulations over the next several years to have a material impact on our competitive or financial position but can give no assurance that such expenditures will not exceed current expectations, especially as such laws are evolving quickly and obligations on companies like ours may become more burdensome over time. From time to time, we receive notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or equivalent state or international environmental agencies that we are a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which is commonly known as the Superfund Act, and equivalent laws. Such notices may assert potential liability for cleanup costs at various sites, which include sites owned by us, sites we previously owned and treatment or disposal sites not owned by us, allegedly containing hazardous substances attributable to us from past operations. We are not presently aware of any such liability that could be material to our business, financial condition or operating results, but due to the nature of our business and environmental risks, we cannot provide assurance that any such material liability will not arise in the future.Electronic products are subject to environmental regulation in a number of jurisdictions. Equipment produced by us is subject to domestic and international requirements requiring end-of-life management and/or restricting materials in products delivered to customers. We believe that we have substantially complied with such rules and regulations, where applicable, with respect to our existing products sold into such jurisdictions.Radio communications are also subject to various governmental regulation. Equipment produced by us is subject to domestic and international requirements to avoid interference among users of radio frequencies and to permit interconnection of telecommunications equipment. We believe that we have substantially complied with such rules and regulations with respect to our existing products, and we intend to comply with such rules and regulations with respect to our future products. Reallocation of the frequency spectrum could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have a comprehensive policy and procedures in effect concerning conflict minerals compliance.Human Capital ManagementAs of June 27, 2025, we had 923 employees, of whom 920 were full-time employees and 250 were located in the U.S. None of our employees in the U.S. are represented by a labor union. In certain international subsidiaries, our employees are represented by workers’ councils or statutory labor unions. In general, we believe that our employee relations are good. In the highly competitive technology market, we have been able to attract and retain diverse, well-qualified talent across our functions. Through our structured hiring process, we work to provide training for hiring managers in the selection process, detailed onboarding plans for new hires and surveys at regular intervals during the first months of employment to help measure engagement and support success. In fiscal year 2025, we conducted a global engagement survey of our existing employee population and to help identify action items at the functional level as well as establish company-wide initiatives to continually improve our culture and processes.We believe we offer a competitive compensation package, tailored to the job function and location of each employee and linked to internal and external benchmarking. We have a global team, and we offer competitive compensation and benefits programs that meet the needs of our employees, while also reflecting local market practices. Our U.S. benefits plan includes health benefits, life and disability insurance, various voluntary insurances, flexible time off and leave programs, and a retirement plan with employer match. Our international benefits plans are competitive locally and generally provide similar benefits. We grant equity-based compensation to many of our employees. In addition, we offer benefits to support our employees’ physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health and encourage healthy behaviors.13Information about our Executive OfficersThe executive officers of Aviat as of September 10, 2025, are as follows:Name and AgePosition Currently Held and Past Business ExperiencePeter A.

References to our website in this Form 10-K are provided as a convenience and should not be deemed an incorporation by reference or a part of this Form 10-K.Additional information relating to our business and operations is set forth in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Item 1A. Risk FactorsThe nature of the business activities conducted by the Company subjects us to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to the Company’s business activities. Other risks are described in “Item 1. Business,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” Prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings.We face many business risks, including those related to our financial performance, investments in our common stock, operating our business and legal matters. If any of these risks occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the market price of the Company’s common stock could decline.15Risk Factors SummaryThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.Business and Operational Risk Factors•Our sales cycle may be lengthy, and the timing of sales, along with additional services such as network design, installation and implementation of our products within our customers’ networks, may extend over more than one period, which can make our operating results more volatile and difficult to predict and can complicate the proper recognition of revenue on more complex sales transactions. •Our success will depend on new products introduced to the marketplace in a timely manner, successfully completing product transitioning and achieving customer acceptance. •We rely on various third-party service partners to help complement our global operations, and failure to adequately manage these relationships could adversely impact our financial results and relationships with customers.•We continually evaluate the optimal mix and location of our manufacturing assets and our third-party contract manufacturer assets, and any movement or re-allocation of these manufacturing assets may not be successful, could disrupt our operations, cause us to incur increased costs, and adversely affect our business and our operating results.•We must respond to rapid technological change and comply with evolving industry standards and requirements for our products to be successful. •Our average sales prices may decline in the future.•Credit and commercial risks and exposures could increase if the financial condition of our customers declines. •Our restructuring actions could harm our relationships with our employees and impact our ability to recruit new employees.•Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel. •We face strong competition for maintaining and improving our position in the market, which can adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results. •Our ability to sell our products and compete successfully is highly dependent on the quality of our customer service and support, and our failure to offer high quality service and support could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.•Product performance problems, including undetected errors in our hardware or software, or deployment delays could harm our business and reputation. •If we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements or customer demand, we could incur additional costs, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. •If we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships, we could incur additional costs or be unable to timely fulfill our customer commitments, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations and, in the event of an inability to fulfill commitments, would harm our customer relationships. •We depend on sole or limited sources and geographies for some key components and failure to receive timely delivery of any of these components could result in deferred or lost sales.•Because a significant amount of our revenue may come from a limited number of customers, the termination of any of these customer relationships may adversely affect our business.•We continually evaluate strategic transaction opportunities which could involve merger, divestiture, sale and/or acquisition activities that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results, and may require management to devote significant attention and resources to achieve strategic transactions.16Financial and Macroeconomic Risk Factors•Due to the volume of our international sales, we may be susceptible to a number of political, economic and geographic risks that could harm our business. •There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and if we fail to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, it could adversely impact our business, results of operations, investor confidence and our stock price. •We may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders.•The effects of global financial and economic conditions in certain markets and of certain economies and sovereign states have had, and may continue to have, significant effects on our customers and suppliers, and has in the past, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and stock price.•Changes in tax laws, treaties, rulings, regulations or agreements, or their interpretation in any country in which we operate; the loss of a major tax dispute; a successful challenge to our operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries; or other factors could cause volatility in our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our operating results.•Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes and other tax benefits may be limited.Legal and Regulatory Risk Factors•Continued tension in global trade relations, including U.S.-China trade relations, may adversely impact our supply chain operations and business. •If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we may be deprived of legal recourse against those who misappropriate our intellectual property.•If sufficient radio frequency spectrum is not allocated for use by our products, or we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our products, our ability to market our products may be restricted. •Our business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance, public disclosure and anti-bribery measures which have resulted in increased costs and may continue to result in additional costs or potential liabilities in the future. •Our products are used in critical communications networks which may subject us to significant liability claims.•We may be subject to litigation regarding our intellectual property. This litigation could be costly to defend and resolve and could prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology.•We are subject to laws, rules, regulations and policies regarding data privacy and cybersecurity. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and reinterpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, reputational damage or other harm to our business.•We are subject to complex federal, state, local and international laws and regulations related to protection of the environment that could materially and adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations, as well as those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers.•Increased attention to Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) matters, conservation measures and climate change issues has contributed to an evolving state of environmental regulation, which could impact our results of operations, financial or competitive position and may adversely impact our business.•Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (the “Plan”), and provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated Bylaws could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.17General Risk Factors•Natural disasters or other catastrophic events such as terrorism and war could have an adverse effect on our business. •System security risks, data protection breaches, and cyberattacks could compromise our proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price. For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.Business and Operational Risk FactorsOur sales cycle may be lengthy, and the timing of sales, along with additional services such as network design, installation and implementation of our products within our customers’ networks, may extend over more than one period, which can make our operating results more volatile and difficult to predict and can complicate the proper recognition of revenue on more complex sales transactions. We experience difficulty in accurately predicting the timing of the sale of products and amounts of revenue generated from sales of our products, primarily in developing countries. The establishment of a business relationship with a potential customer is a lengthy process, usually taking several months or more. Following the establishment of the relationship, the negotiation of purchase terms can be time-consuming, and a potential customer may require an extended evaluation and testing period. Once a purchase agreement has been executed, the timing and amount of revenue, if applicable, may remain difficult to predict. Our typical product sales cycle, which results in our products being designed into our customers’ networks, can take 12 to 24 months. A number of factors contribute to the length of the sales cycle, including technical evaluations of our products and the design process required to integrate our products into our customers’ networks. The completion of services such as installation and testing of the customer’s networks and the completion of all other suppliers’ network elements are subject to the customer’s timing and efforts and other factors outside our control, each of which may prevent us from making predictions of revenue with any certainty and could cause us to experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in our operating results.Due to the challenges from our lengthy sales cycle, our recognition of revenue from our selling efforts may be substantially delayed, our ability to forecast our future revenue may be more limited and our revenue may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.Our operating results are expected to be difficult to predict and delays in product delivery or closing a sale can cause revenue, margins and net income or loss to fluctuate significantly from anticipated levels. A substantial portion of our contracts are completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are large orders. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability and can increase our inventory. The number of large new transactions also increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions. In addition, we may increase spending in response to competitive actions, in pursuit of new market opportunities, or to mitigate supply chain disruptions. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to achieve profitability in the future or that if profitability is attained, that we will be able to sustain profitability, particularly on a quarter-to-quarter basis.18Our success will depend on new products introduced to the marketplace in a timely manner, successfully completing product transitioning and achieving customer acceptance.The market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. Our future success will depend, in part, on continuous timely development and introduction of new products and enhancements that address evolving market requirements and are attractive to customers. If we fail to develop or introduce, on a timely basis, new products or product enhancements or features that achieve market acceptance, our business may suffer. Additionally, we work closely with a variety of third-party partners to develop new product features and new platforms. Should our partners face delays in the development process, then the timing of the rollout of our new products may be significantly impacted which may negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. Another factor impacting our future success is the growth in the customer demand of our new products. Rapidly changing technology, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product life cycles and changes in customer requirements characterize the markets for our products. We believe that successful new product introductions provide a significant competitive advantage because of the significant resources committed by customers in adopting new products and their reluctance to change products after these resources have been expended. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant resources on internal research and development to support our effort to develop and introduce new products and enhancements.As we transition to new product platforms, we face significant risk that the development of our new products may not be accepted by our current customers or by new customers. To the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products that are adopted by customers, we could fail to obtain an adequate return on these investments and could lose market share to our competitors, which could be difficult or impossible to regain. Similarly, we may face decreased revenue, gross margins and profitability due to a rapid decline in sales of current products as customers hold spending to focus purchases on new product platforms. We could incur significant costs in completing the transition, including costs of inventory write-downs of the current product as customers transition to new product platforms. In addition, products or technologies developed by others may render our products non-competitive or obsolete and result in significant reduction in orders from our customers and the loss of existing and prospective customers.We rely on various third-party service partners to help complement our global operations, and failure to adequately manage these relationships could adversely impact our financial results and relationships with customers.We rely on a number of third-party service partners, to complement our global operations. We rely upon these partners for certain installation, maintenance, logistics and support functions. In addition, as our customers increasingly seek to rely on vendors to perform additional services relating to the design, construction and operation of their networks, the scope of work performed by our service partners is likely to increase and may include areas where we have less experience providing or managing such services. We must successfully identify, assess, train and certify qualified service partners to ensure the proper installation, deployment and maintenance of our products. The vetting and certification of these partners can be costly and time-consuming, and certain partners may not have the same operational history, financial resources and scale as we have. Moreover, certain service partners may provide similar services for other companies, including our competitors. We may not be able to manage our relationships with our service partners effectively, and we cannot be certain that they will be able to deliver services in the manner or time required, that we will be able to maintain the continuity of their services, or that they will adhere to our approach to ethical business practices. If we do not effectively manage our relationships with third-party service partners, or if they fail to perform these services in the manner or time required, our financial results and relationships with our customers could be adversely affected.We continually evaluate the optimal mix and location of our manufacturing assets and our third-party contract manufacturer assets, and any movement or re-allocation of these manufacturing assets may not be successful, could disrupt our operations, cause us to incur increased costs, and adversely affect our business and our operating results.Our global manufacturing strategy follows an outsourced manufacturing model using contract manufacturing partners in Asia and the United States. We continually evaluate the optimal mix and location of our manufacturing assets and our third-party contract manufacturer assets, to optimize our manufacturing footprint with our global customer base. Any of our decisions to move or re-allocate manufacturing assets to new locations or different third-party contract manufacturers may not be successful, could disrupt our operations, cause us to incur increased costs, and adversely affect our business and our operating results. The movement of manufacturing assets can be capital intensive, costly and time-consuming, and may cause disruptions in our ability to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner.19If we are not successful in optimizing the mix and location of our manufacturing assets and our third-party contract manufacturer assets, our financial results and relationships with our customers could be adversely affected.We must respond to rapid technological change and comply with evolving industry standards and requirements for our products to be successful.The optical transport networking equipment market is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. We continually invest in research and development to sustain or enhance our existing products, but the introduction of new communications technologies and the emergence of new industry standards or requirements could render our products obsolete. Further, in developing our products, we have made, and will continue to make, assumptions with respect to which standards or requirements will be adopted by our customers and competitors. If the standards or requirements adopted by our prospective customers are different from those on which we have focused our efforts, market acceptance of our products would be reduced or delayed, and our business would be harmed.We are continuing to invest a significant portion of our research and development efforts in the development of our next-generation products. We expect our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their existing products and introduce new products and technologies and to influence customers’ buying criteria so as to emphasize product capabilities that we do not, or may not, possess. To be competitive, we must anticipate future customer requirements and continue to invest significant resources in research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support. If we do not anticipate these future customer requirements and invest in the technologies necessary to enable us to have and to sell the appropriate solutions, it may limit our competitive position and future sales, which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may not have sufficient resources to make these investments and we may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive.Our average sales prices may decline in the future. We have experienced, and could continue to experience, declining sales prices. This price pressure is likely to result in downward pricing pressure on our products and services. As a result, we are likely to experience declining average sales prices for our products. Our future profitability will depend upon our ability to improve manufacturing efficiencies, to reduce the costs of materials used in our products and to continue to introduce new lower-cost products and product enhancements and if we are unable to do so, we may not be able to respond to pricing pressures. If we are unable to respond to increased price competition, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. Because customers frequently negotiate supply arrangements far in advance of delivery dates, we may be required to commit to price reductions for our products before we are aware of how, or if, cost reductions can be obtained. As a result, current or future price reduction commitments and any inability on our part to respond to increased price competition could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Credit and commercial risks and exposures could increase if the financial condition of our customers declines. A substantial portion of our sales are to customers in the telecommunications industry. These customers may require their suppliers, including the Company, to provide extended payment terms, direct loans or other forms of financial support as a condition to obtaining commercial contracts. In addition, if local currencies cannot be hedged, we have an inherent exposure in our ability to convert monies at favorable rates from or to U.S. dollars. More generally, we expect to routinely enter into long-term contracts involving significant amounts to be paid by our customers over time. Pursuant to these contracts, we may deliver products and services representing an important portion of the contract price before receiving any significant payment from the customer. As a result of the financing that may be provided to customers and our commercial risk exposure under long-term contracts, our business could be adversely affected if the financial condition of our customers erodes. Over the past few years, certain of our customers have filed with the courts seeking protection under the bankruptcy or reorganization laws of the applicable jurisdiction or have experienced financial difficulties. Our customers’ financial conditions face additional challenges in many emerging markets, where our customers are being affected not only by recession, but by deteriorating local currencies and a lack of credit. If customers fail to meet their obligations to us, we may experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of reserves, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.20Our business requires extensive credit risk management that may not be adequate to protect against customer nonpayment. A risk of non-payment by customers is a significant focus of our business. We expect a significant amount of future revenue to come from international customers in developing countries. We do not generally expect to obtain collateral for sales, although we require letters of credit or credit insurance as appropriate for international customers. Because a significant amount of our revenue may come from a limited number of customers, the termination of any of these customer relationships may adversely affect our business. Our historical accounts receivable balances have been concentrated in a small number of significant customers. Unexpected adverse events impacting the financial condition of our customers, bank failures or other unfavorable regulatory, economic or political events in the countries in which we do business may impact collections and adversely impact our business, require increased bad debt expense or receivable write-offs and adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and operating results, which could also result in a breach of our bank covenants.Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel. Our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, professional, managerial, sales and marketing personnel. Historically, competition for these key personnel has been intense. The loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future, delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, or the loss of key personnel to competitors could make it difficult for us to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals.We face strong competition for maintaining and improving our position in the market, which can adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results. The wireless access, interconnection and backhaul business is a specialized segment of the wireless telecommunications industry and is extremely competitive. Competition in this segment is intense, and we expect it to increase. Some of our competitors have more extensive engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities and significantly greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. In addition, some of our competitors have greater name recognition, broader product lines, a larger installed base of products and longer-standing customer relationships. Our competitors include established companies, such as Ericsson, Huawei and Nokia, as well as a number of other public and private companies, such as Ceragon Networks. Some of our competitors are OEMs or systems integrators through whom we market and sell our products, which means our business success may depend on these competitors to some extent. One or more of our largest customers could internally develop the capability to manufacture products similar to those manufactured or outsourced by us and, as a result, the demand for our products and services may decrease.In addition, we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with many entities that have substantially greater resources than we have. Our competitors may enter business combinations to accelerate product development or to compete more aggressively and we may lack the resources to meet such enhanced competition.Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including price, quality, availability, customer service and support, breadth of product lines, product performance and features, rapid time-to-market delivery capabilities, reliability, timing of new product introductions by us, our customers and competitors, the ability of our customers to obtain financing and the stability of regional sociopolitical and geopolitical circumstances, and the ability of large competitors to obtain business by providing more seller financing especially for large transactions. We can give no assurances that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise, or marketing, sales, distribution, customer service and support capabilities to compete successfully, or that regional sociopolitical and geographic circumstances will be favorable for our successful operation.Our ability to sell our products and compete successfully is highly dependent on the quality of our customer service and support, and our failure to offer high quality service and support could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.Once our products are delivered, our customers depend on our service and support to resolve any issues relating to our products. Our support personnel includes employees in various geographic locations, who provide general technical support to our customers. A high level of support is important for the successful marketing and sale of our products. If we do not effectively help our customers quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing support, it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing customers as well as demand for maintenance and renewal contracts and could harm our reputation with existing and potential customers.21Product performance problems, including undetected errors in our hardware or software, or deployment delays could harm our business and reputation.The development and production of products with high technology content is complicated and often involves problems with hardware, software, components and manufacturing methods. Complex hardware and software systems, such as our products, can often contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released. In addition, errors associated with components we purchase from third parties, including customized components, may be difficult to resolve. We have experienced issues in the past in connection with our products, including failures due to the receipt of faulty components from our suppliers and performance issues related to software updates. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components or provide software remedies or other remediation in response to errors or bugs, and we may have to do so again in the future. In addition, performance issues can be heightened during periods where we are developing and introducing multiple new products to the market, as any performance issues we encounter in one technology or product could impact the performance or timing of delivery of other products. Our products may also suffer degradation of performance and reliability over time.If reliability, quality, security or network monitoring problems develop, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including:•reduced orders from existing customers;•declining interest from potential customers;•delays in our ability to recognize revenue or in collecting accounts receivables;•costs associated with fixing hardware or software defects or replacing products;•high service and warranty expenses;•delays in shipments;•high inventory excess and obsolescence expense;•high levels of product returns;•diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts; and•payment of liquidated damages, performance guarantees or similar penalties.Because we outsource the manufacturing of certain components of our products, we may also be subject to product performance problems as a result of the acts or omissions of third parties, and we may not have adequate compensating remedies against such third parties.From time to time, we encounter interruptions or delays in the activation of our products at a customer’s site. These interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from issues with installation and activation, some of which are outside our control. If we experience significant interruptions or delays that we cannot promptly resolve, the associated revenue for these installations may be delayed or confidence in our products could be undermined, which could cause us to lose customers, fail to add new customers, and consequently harm our financial results.If we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements or customer demand, we could incur additional costs, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements or forecast customer demand, we may incur additional costs of manufacturing, and our gross margins and financial results could be adversely affected. If we overestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may experience an oversupply of components and assess us charges for excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins. If we underestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory or components, which could interrupt manufacturing and result in higher manufacturing costs, shipment delays, damage to customer relationships and/or our payment of penalties to our customers. Our contract manufacturers also have other customers and may not have sufficient capacity to meet all of their customers’ needs, including ours, during periods of excess demand.22If we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships, we could incur additional costs or be unable to timely fulfill our customer commitments, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations and, in the event of an inability to fulfill commitments, would harm our customer relationships. We outsource all of our manufacturing and a substantial portion of our repair service operations to independent contract manufacturers and other third parties. Our contract manufacturers typically manufacture our products based on rolling forecasts of our product needs that we provide to them on a regular basis. The contract manufacturers are responsible for procuring components necessary to build our products based on our rolling forecasts, building and assembling the products, testing the products in accordance with our specifications and then shipping the products to us. We configure the products to our customer requirements, conduct final testing and then ship the products to our customers. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter problems with our contract manufacturer related to these manufacturing services or that we will be able to replace a contract manufacturer that is not able to meet our demand.In addition, if we fail to effectively manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers or other service providers, or if they do not fully comply with their contractual obligations or should experience delays, disruptions, component procurement problems or quality control problems, then our ability to ship products to our customers or otherwise fulfill our contractual obligations to our customers could be delayed or impaired which would adversely affect our business, financial results and customer relationships.We depend on sole or limited sources and geographies for some key components and failure to receive timely delivery of any of these components could result in deferred or lost sales.In some instances, we are dependent upon one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature of a particular item or because of local content preference requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project. Examples of sole or limited sourcing categories include metal fabrications and castings, for which we own the tooling and therefore limit our supplier relationships, and MMICs (a type of integrated circuit used in manufacturing microwave radios), which we procure at a volume discount from a single source. Additionally, certain semiconductor supply is concentrated in Taiwan, with little to no availability in other geographies. As such, any military conflict between Taiwan and China could interrupt supply.Our supply chain strategy includes mitigation plans for alternative manufacturing sources and identified alternate suppliers. However, if these alternatives cannot address our requirements when our existing sources of these components fail to deliver them on time, we could suffer delayed shipments, canceled orders and lost or deferred revenues, as well as material damage to our customer relationships. Should this occur, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Because a significant amount of our revenue may come from a limited number of customers, the termination of any of these customer relationships may adversely affect our business. Although we have a large customer base, during any given quarter or fiscal year a small number of customers may account for a significant portion of our revenue. Principal customers for our products and services include domestic and international wireless/mobile service providers, OEMs, as well as private network users such as public safety agencies; government institutions; and utility, pipeline, railroad and other industrial enterprises that operate broadband wireless networks. In addition, the telecommunications industry has experienced significant consolidation among its participants, and we expect this trend to continue. Some operators in this industry have experienced financial difficulty and have filed, or may file, for bankruptcy protection. Other operators may merge and one or more of our competitors may supply products to the customers of the combined company following those mergers. This consolidation could result in purchasing decision delays and decreased opportunities for us to supply products to companies following any consolidation. This consolidation may also result in lost opportunities for cost reduction and economies of scale, and could generally reduce our opportunities to win new customers to the extent that the number of potential customers decreases. Furthermore, as our customers become larger, they may have more leverage to negotiate better pricing which could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.It is possible that a significant portion of our future product sales could become even more concentrated in a limited number of customers due to the factors described above. Product sales to major customers have varied widely from period to period. The loss of any existing customer, a significant reduction in the level of sales to any existing customer, the consolidation of existing customers, or our inability to gain additional customers could result in declines in our revenue or an inability to grow revenue.23We continually evaluate strategic transaction opportunities which could involve merger, divestiture, sale and/or acquisition activities that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results, and may require management to devote significant attention and resources to achieve strategic transactions.Our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including the following:•difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the combined companies, particularly companies with large and widespread operations and/or complex products;•diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from business combinations, sales, divestitures and/or restructurings;•potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development intangibles;•difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in each market have stronger market positions;•initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; and•the potential loss of key employees, customers, resellers, vendors and other business partners of our Company or the companies with which we engage in strategic transactions following and continuing after announcement of an anticipated strategic transaction.Strategic transactions may also cause us to:•issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders or cause a change in control of the combined company;•use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt;•significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition;•assume material liabilities;•record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;•incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;•incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R&D cost sharing arrangement and legal structure;•incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses; and•become subject to intellectual property or other litigation.Mergers, restructurings, sales and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control. No assurance can be given that any future strategic transactions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully complete a strategic transaction could materially harm our business and operating results. Even when an acquired or acquiring company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.24Strategic transactions may require our management to devote significant attention and resources to integrating acquired businesses within our business. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among others:•the inability to successfully integrate the acquired business into the Aviat business in a manner that permits us to achieve the revenue and synergies we anticipated from the transaction;•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with strategic transactions;•integrating personnel from acquired businesses, while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services;•integrating relationships with customers, vendors and business partners;•performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing strategic transactions and integrating acquired operations into Aviat; or•the disruption of, or loss of momentum in, the ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.Delays or difficulties in the integration process could adversely affect our business, financial results, financial condition and stock price. Even if we are able to integrate our business operations successfully, there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that we currently expect or have communicated from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame.Financial and Macroeconomic Risk FactorsDue to the volume of our international sales, we may be susceptible to a number of political, economic, financial and geographic risks that could harm our business. We are highly dependent on sales to customers outside the U.S. In fiscal 2025, our sales to international customers accounted for 56% of total revenue. Significant portions of our international sales are in less developed countries. Our international sales are likely to continue to account for a large percentage of our products and services revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, the occurrence of any international, political, economic or geographic event could result in a significant decline in revenue. In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.25Some of the risks and challenges of doing business internationally include:•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;•fluctuations in international currency exchange rates including its impact on unhedgeable currencies and our forecast variations for hedgeable currencies;•imposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions;•management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries;•the burden of complying with a variety of laws and regulations in various countries;•application of the income tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions, including relatively low-rate and relatively high-rate jurisdictions, to our sales and other transactions, which results in additional complexity and uncertainty;•the conduct of unethical business practices in developing countries;•general economic and geopolitical conditions, including inflation and trade relationships;•restrictions on travel to locations where we conduct business;•war and acts of terrorism;•kidnapping and high crime rate;•natural disasters;•availability of U.S. dollars especially in countries with economies highly dependent on resource exports, particularly oil; and•changes in export regulations.While these factors and the impacts of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.A material portion of our sales and expenses stem from countries outside of the United States, and are in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and therefore subject to foreign currency fluctuation. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency rates could have a material impact on our financial results in future periods. From time to time, we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted foreign currency expenses. These forward contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on certain transactions, but do not cover all foreign-denominated transactions and therefore do not entirely eliminate the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our results of operations and financial condition.There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and if we fail to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, it could adversely impact our business, results of operations, investor confidence and our stock price. We do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes, including at times of personnel turnover. Controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management’s override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of our stock could decline. We may not be successful implementing internal control procedures related to acquired businesses. Our evaluation and remediation of assessed deficiencies over internal controls, if any, could require us to incur significant expense and adversely affect our operating results, investor confidence and our stock price.26Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002(“SOX”), we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements, reduce investor confidence, and adversely affect our stock price. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A “Controls and Procedures” in this Form 10-K, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2025, due to certain material weaknesses identified related to an ineffective control environment and control activities. We implemented certain corrective measures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, including hiring a new CFO and backfilling vacancies resulting from key finance and accounting personnel turnover. In fiscal 2025, we implemented several internal control enhancements and hired a new Global Controller and other key financial positions. However, due to the material weaknesses described above, there is a reasonable possibility that our existing controls would not have detected a material misstatement in a timely manner if it were to be material. These measures are part of a process of remediating the material weaknesses that is under way and that we believe will remediate the material weaknesses. However, if we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses in an appropriate and timely manner, or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, our ability to accurately record, process, and report financial information and, consequently, our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected. Our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in violations of applicable securities laws and stock exchange listing requirements; subject us to litigation and investigations; negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements; and adversely impact our stock price and ability to access capital markets.We may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, the available line of credit under our credit facility and future cash collections from customers will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. However, it is possible that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our longer-term capital needs. If this occurs, we may need to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, or obtain additional equity or debt financing. We have no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms if and when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. The effects of global or market specific financial and economic conditions in certain markets and of certain economies and sovereign states have had, and may continue to have, significant effects on our customers and suppliers, and has in the past, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and stock price.The effects of global financial and economic conditions in certain markets and of certain economies and sovereign states include, among other things, significant reductions in available capital and liquidity from credit markets, supply or demand driven inflationary pressures, and substantial fluctuations in currency values worldwide.Economic conditions in certain markets have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our customers’ access to capital and/or willingness to spend capital on our products, and/or their levels of cash liquidity and/or their ability and/or willingness to pay for products that they will order or have already ordered from us, or result in their ceasing operations. Further, we have experienced an increasing number of our customers, principally in emerging markets, requesting longer payment terms, lease or vendor financing arrangements, longer terms for the letters of credit securing purchases of our products and services, which could potentially negatively impact our orders, revenue conversion cycle, and cash flows.In seeking to reduce their expenses, we have also seen significant pressure from our customers to lower prices for our products as they try to improve their operating performance and procure additional capital equipment within their reduced budget levels. To the extent that we lower prices on our products and services, our orders, revenues, and gross margins may be negatively impacted. Additionally, certain emerging markets are particularly sensitive to pricing as a key differentiator. Where price is a primary decision driver, we may not be able to effectively compete, or we may choose not to compete due to unacceptable margins.27In addition, economic conditions in certain markets could materially adversely affect our suppliers’ access to capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventories, production levels, or product quality, could cause them to raise prices or lower production levels, or result in their ceasing operations. Supply or demand driven scarcity can lead to significant inflationary pressures on the cost of our products from our suppliers. Our ability to substantially offset inflationary impacts by raising prices may be limited by the competitive factors discussed above.If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, or downgrades of credit ratings of other sovereign states, our ability and our customers and suppliers ability to access capital and maintain liquidity for continuing operations may be adversely affected.Further, with respect to our credit facility discussed under “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Strategies” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our ability to access the funds available under our credit facility could be materially adversely affected.The potential effects of these economic factors are difficult to forecast and mitigate. As a consequence, our operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could adversely affect our stock price.Changes in tax laws, treaties, rulings, regulations or agreements, or their interpretation in any country in which we operate; the loss of a major tax dispute; a successful challenge to our operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries; or other factors could cause volatility in our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our operating results. We operate in multiple jurisdictions and our profits are taxed pursuant to the tax laws of these jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:•the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;•adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;•increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;•our ability to utilize net operating losses;•changes in available tax credits;•changes in share-based compensation expense;•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;•changes in domestic or international tax laws, treaties, rulings, regulations or agreements or the interpretation of such tax laws, treaties, rulings, regulations or agreements, including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and any new administrations;•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities, including the loss of a major tax dispute;•local tax authority challenging our operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries; •the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods; and•taxes that may be incurred upon a repatriation of cash from foreign operations.Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could impact our results of operations for future periods adversely.28Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes and other tax benefits may be limited.Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset if a corporation experiences an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when a company’s “five-percent shareholders” (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in the company by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Additionally, various states have similar limitations on the use of state net operating losses (“NOL”) following an ownership change.If we experience an ownership change, our ability to use our NOLs, any loss or deduction attributable to a “net unrealized built-in loss” and other tax attributes (collectively, the “Tax Benefits”) could be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the Tax Benefits could be substantially delayed, which could significantly impair the value of the Tax Benefits. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the Tax Benefits and we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance related to the amount of the Tax Benefits that may not be realized, which could adversely impact our results of operations.We believe that these Tax Benefits are a valuable asset for us. The Amended and Restated Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (the “Plan”), dated as of August 27, 2020, and amended as of February 28, 2023, is intended to protect our Tax Benefits during the effective period of the Plan. The amended Plan was approved at the Company’s November 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which extended the final expiration date of the Plan until March 3, 2026. Although the Plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an “ownership change” that could adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the restrictions on transferability in the Plan will prevent all transfers that could result in such an “ownership change”.The Plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, us or a large block of our common stock. A third party that acquires 4.9% or more of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the Plan through the issuance of common stock or common stock equivalents to all stockholders other than the acquiring person. The foregoing provisions may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock by discouraging potential investors from acquiring our stock. In addition, these provisions could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, or impede an attempt to acquire a significant or controlling interest in us, even if such events might be beneficial to us and our stockholders.Legal and Regulatory Risk FactorsContinued tension in global trade relations, including U.S.-China trade relations, may adversely impact our supply chain operations and business. The U.S. government has taken, and continues to propose, certain actions that change U.S. trade policies, including tariffs that affect certain products manufactured in other countries, including China. Some components manufactured outside the U.S. are subject to tariffs if imported into the United States. Further, other countries are proposing and implementing increased tariffs in response, introducing uncertainty into the marketplace. The Chinese government has taken certain responsive actions, including increased tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in the United States. Certain of our products manufactured in our U.S. operations are subject to the tariffs imposed on imports into China from the United States. We plan to mitigate the impact of tariffs by optimizing sourcing and operations to minimize cost impacts. Although some of the products and components we import are affected by the tariffs, at this time, we do not expect these tariffs to have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is unknown whether and to what extent additional new tariffs (or other new laws or regulations) will be adopted that increase the cost or feasibility of importing and/or exporting products and components from other countries to the United States and vice versa. Further, the effect of any such new tariffs or retaliatory actions on our industry and customers is unknown and difficult to predict. As additional new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if China or other affected countries take further responsive trade actions, and/or our mitigation strategies are not successful, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.29If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we may be deprived of legal recourse against those who misappropriate our intellectual property. Our ability to compete will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology in the U.S. and internationally. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents, contractual rights and technological measures to protect our intellectual property rights from infringement, misappropriation or other violations to maintain our brand and competitive position. We also make business decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. With respect to patents, we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any currently pending patent application or future patent applications, or that any of our patents, once issued, will provide us with adequate protection from competing products or intellectual property owned by others. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable or narrowed in scope. Furthermore, we may not be able to prevent infringement, misappropriation and unauthorized, use of our owned and exclusively-licensed intellectual property. We also cannot provide assurances that the protection provided to our intellectual property by the laws and courts of particular nations will be substantially similar to the protection and remedies available under U.S. law. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurances that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the U.S. or based on intellectual property rights and laws in other nations that are different from those established in the U.S.In addition, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and enter into non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party who has developed intellectual property on our behalf and each party that has or may have had access to our confidential information, know-how and trade secrets. These agreements may be insufficient or breached, or may not effectively prevent unauthorized access to or unauthorized use, disclosure, misappropriation or reverse engineering of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology. Moreover, these agreements may not provide an adequate remedy for breaches or in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or technology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret or know-how, or misappropriated or violated intellectual property is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable.We cannot give assurances that any steps taken by us will be adequate to deter infringement, misappropriation, violation, dilution or otherwise impede independent third-party development of similar technologies. Any of our intellectual property rights may be successfully challenged, opposed, diluted, misappropriated, violated or circumvented by others or invalidated, narrowed in scope or held unenforceable through administrative process or litigation in the United States or in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, intellectual property laws may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secrets and other intellectual property rights. In the event that such intellectual property arrangements are insufficient, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. If sufficient radio frequency spectrum is not allocated for use by our products, or we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our products, our ability to market our products may be restricted.We may be affected by the allocation and auction of the radio frequency spectrum by governmental authorities both in the U.S. and internationally. The unavailability of sufficient radio frequency spectrum may inhibit the future growth of wireless communications networks. In addition, to operate in a jurisdiction, we must obtain regulatory approval for our products and each jurisdiction in which we market our products has its own regulations governing radio communications. If we are unable to obtain sufficient allocation of radio frequency spectrum by the appropriate governmental authority or obtain the proper regulatory approval for our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.30Our business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance, public disclosure and anti-bribery measures which have resulted in increased costs and may continue to result in additional costs or potential liabilities in the future. We are subject to rules and regulations of federal and state regulatory authorities, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) and financial market entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, and foreign and domestic legislative bodies. During the past few years, these entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC, NASDAQ and several foreign governments, have issued requirements, laws and regulations and continue to develop additional requirements, laws and regulations, most notably
SOX, and recent laws and regulations regarding bribery and unfair competition, including the SEC’s recently-approved (though currently paused, pending litigation) rules relating to the disclosure of climate-related information. Our efforts to comply with these requirements and regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of substantial management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs potentially necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. Finally, if we are unable to ensure compliance with such requirements, laws, or regulations, we may be subject to costly prosecution and liability, and resulting reputational harm, from such noncompliance.Our products are used in critical communications networks which may subject us to significant liability claims.Because our products are used in critical communications networks, we may be subject to significant liability claims if our products do not work properly. We warrant to our current customers that our products will operate in accordance with our product specifications. If our products fail to conform to these specifications, our customers could require us to remedy the failure or could assert claims for damages. The provisions in our agreements with customers that are intended to limit our exposure to liability claims may not preclude all potential claims. In addition, any insurance policies we have may not adequately limit our exposure with respect to such claims. Liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages. Any such claims, whether or not successful, would be costly and time-consuming to defend, and could divert management’s attention and seriously damage our reputation and our business.We may be subject to litigation regarding our intellectual property. This litigation could be costly to defend and resolve and could prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology.The wireless telecommunications industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in often protracted and expensive litigation. Any litigation regarding patents or other owned or exclusively licensed intellectual property, including claims that our use of intellectual property infringes or violates the rights of others, could be costly and time-consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved, and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Such litigation or claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the use and transfer of allegedly infringing technology or the sale of allegedly infringing products and expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses for the infringing technology. We can give no assurances that we would be successful in developing such non-infringing technology or that any license for the infringing technology would be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. This could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition, competitive position and prospects.31We are subject to laws, rules, regulations and policies regarding data privacy and cybersecurity. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and reinterpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, reputational damage or other harm to our business.We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, directives, rules, standards, regulations, policies and contractual obligations relating to data privacy and security. The regulatory framework for data privacy and security worldwide is continuously evolving and developing and, as a result, interpretation and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. It is also possible inquiries and enforcement actions from governmental authorities regarding cybersecurity breaches increase in frequency and scope. These data privacy and security laws also are not uniform, which may complicate and increase our costs for compliance. As a result, we anticipate needing to dedicate substantial resources to comply with such laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy and cybersecurity. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that we will not face claims, allegations, or other proceedings related to our obligations under applicable data privacy and security laws. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with any applicable laws relating to data privacy and security, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized access, improper disclosure, or misappropriation of personal data or other customer data, could result in significant liabilities, and negative publicity and reputational harm, one or all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operations.We are subject to complex federal, state, local and international laws and regulations related to protection of the environment that could materially and adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations, as well as those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers.Environmental, health and safety regulations govern the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products, including without limitation regulations governing the emission of pollutants and the use, remediation, and disposal of hazardous materials (including electronic wastes). Our failure or the failure of our suppliers or contract manufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling or disposal of waste generated from our operations could subject us to increased compliance costs or liabilities such as fines and penalties. We may also be subject to costs and liabilities for environmental clean-up costs on sites owned by us, sites previously owned by us, or treatment and disposal of wastes attributable to us from past operations, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or equivalent laws. Existing and future environmental regulations may additionally restrict our and our suppliers’ use of certain materials to manufacture, assemble and test products. New or more stringent environmental requirements applicable to our operations or the operations of our suppliers could adversely affect our costs of doing business and result in material costs to our operations.Increased attention to ESG matters, conservation measures and climate change issues has contributed to an evolving state of environmental regulation, which could impact our results of operations, financial or competitive position and may adversely impact our business. Increased attention to, and sometimes conflicting, societal expectations on companies to address, climate change and other environmental and social impacts, investor and societal expectations regarding voluntary ESG disclosures may result in increased costs to us and our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and customers. Moreover, while we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on expectations and assumptions or hypothetical scenarios that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions or hypothetical scenarios are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters. Additionally, in March 2024, the SEC approved final rules that necessitate the disclosure of climate-related information in registration statements and periodic reports. However, the future of the rule is uncertain at this time given that its implementation has been stayed pending the outcome of legal challenges. Moreover, on March 27, 2025, the SEC staff notified the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit that the SEC would withdraw its defense of the final rules. While the SEC may seek to repeal or otherwise modify the final rules, and the Eighth Circuit could still issue a ruling on the legal challenges, we cannot predict whether or when such actions will occur. We are assessing the final rules, but at this time we cannot predict the costs of implementation or any potential adverse impacts resulting from the final rules. To the extent the final rules are upheld, we could incur increased costs relating to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related information in our periodic reports.32Increased public awareness and worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and may result in more international, federal or regional requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate risks related to climate change. As a result, we may become subject to new or more stringent regulations, legislation or other governmental requirements or industry standards, and we anticipate that we will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products, reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, and increasing energy efficiency. Increased regulation of climate change concerns could subject us to additional costs and restrictions and require us to make certain changes to our manufacturing practices and/or product designs, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.Certain public statements with respect to ESG-related matters, such as emissions reduction goals, other environmental targets, or other commitments addressing certain social issues, are becoming increasingly subject to heightened scrutiny from public and governmental authorities, as well as other parties, related to the risk of potential “greenwashing,” (i.e., misleading information or false claims overstating potential benefits). For example, the SEC has taken enforcement action against companies for ESG-related misconduct, including greenwashing. Certain regulators, such as the SEC and various state agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations and other private actors have also filed lawsuits under various securities and consumer protection laws alleging that certain ESG-statements, goals or standards were misleading, false or otherwise deceptive. In addition, any alleged claims of greenwashing against us or others in our industry may lead to further negative sentiments and diversion of investments.Furthermore, certain employment practices and social initiatives are the subject of scrutiny by both those calling for the continued advancement of such policies, as well as those who believe they should be curbed, including government actors, and the complex regulatory and legal frameworks applicable to such initiatives continue to evolve. We cannot be certain of the impact of such regulatory, legal and other developments on our business. More recent political developments could mean that we face increasing criticism or litigation risks from certain “anti-ESG” parties, including various governmental agencies. Such sentiment may focus on our environmental commitments (such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions) or its pursuit of certain employment practices or social initiatives that are alleged to be political or polarizing in nature or are alleged to violate laws based, in part, on changing priorities of, or interpretations by, federal agencies or state governments. Consideration of ESG-related factors in our decision-making could be subject to increasing scrutiny and objection from such anti-ESG parties. As a result, we may face increased litigation risks from private parties and governmental authorities related to our ESG efforts.Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, the Amended and Restated Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (the “Plan”), and provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated Bylaws could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult. Because we are a Delaware corporation, the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be supported by our stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, which prohibits us from engaging in certain business combinations, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. In addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated Bylaws also contain certain provisions that may make a third-party acquisition of us difficult, including the ability of the Board to issue preferred stock and the requirement that nominations for directors and other proposals by stockholders must be made in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected or the proposals are voted upon.In addition, the Plan and the amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Charter Amendments”) could make an acquisition of us more difficult. 33General Risk FactorsNatural disasters or other catastrophic events such as terrorism and war could have an adverse effect on our business. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, extreme weather conditions and floods, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. In addition, climate change may contribute to the increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events, including storms, wildfires, and other natural disasters. Further, acts of terrorism or war could significantly disrupt our supply chain and access to vital components. Such events have in the past and could in the future result in physical damage to one or more of our facilities, the temporary closure of one or more of our facilities or those of our suppliers, a temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, a temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from local or overseas suppliers or contract manufacturers, a temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, and delays in the delivery of goods. Accordingly, climate change and natural disasters may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy necessary for our operations, and could also increase insurance and other operating costs. Many of our facilities around the world (and the operations of our suppliers) are in locations that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change, and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to our facilities or those of our suppliers, such as loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. In addition, if there is a natural disaster in any of the locations in which our significant customers are located, our customers may incur losses or sustained business interruption, or both, which may materially impair their ability to continue their purchase of products from us. Public health issues, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have an adverse impact on customer demand. As a result of any of these events, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive components from suppliers. Although we maintain business interruption insurance and other insurance intended to cover some or all of these risks, such insurance may be inadequate, whether because of coverage amount, policy limitations, the financial viability of the insurance companies issuing such policies, or other reasons.System security risks, data protection breaches, and cyber-attacks could compromise our proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price. In the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and proprietary information of our customers, suppliers and business partners, on our networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Increasingly, companies, including ours, are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to interruption, disruption, destruction, penetration or attacks due to natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, domestic vandalism, Internet failures, computer malware, ransomware, cyberattacks, social engineering attacks, phishing attacks, data breaches and other events unforeseen or generally beyond our control. Additionally, advances in technology, an increased level of sophistication and expertise of hackers, widespread access to generative AI, and new discoveries in the field of cryptography can result in a compromise or breach of our information technology systems or security measures implemented to protect our systems. Any such breach could compromise our systems and networks, which could cause system disruptions or slowdowns and exploitation of security vulnerabilities in our products, and lead to the information stored on our networks being accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, which could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, and cause us reputational and financial harm. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks. An increased number of our employees and service providers are working from home and connecting to our networks remotely on less secure systems, which we believe may further increase the risk of, and our vulnerability to, a cyber-attack or breach on our network. Any such actual or perceived security breach, incident or disruption could also divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and could require us to incur significant costs and operational consequences in connection with investigating, remediating, eliminating and putting in place additional tools, devices, policies, and other measures designed to prevent such security breaches, incidents and system disruptions. Moreover, we could be required by applicable law in some jurisdictions, or otherwise find it appropriate to expend significant capital and other resources, to notify or respond to applicable third parties or regulatory authorities due to any actual or perceived security incidents or breaches to our systems and its root cause.34If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our security products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness and safety of our products could be harmed. Because the techniques used by computer programmers and hackers, many of whom are highly sophisticated and well-funded, to access or sabotage networks or systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used, we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these cyber-attacks. This could impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. In addition, our ability to defend against and mitigate cyberattacks depends in part on prioritization decisions that we and third parties upon whom we rely make to address vulnerabilities and security defects. While we endeavor to address all identified vulnerabilities in our products, we must make determinations as to how we prioritize developing and deploying the respective fixes, and we may be unable to do so prior to an attack. The economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the programmer or hacker, which are often difficult to identify. Furthermore, even once a vulnerability has been addressed, for certain of our products, the fix will only be effective once a customer has updated the impacted product with the latest release, and customers that do not install and run the latest supported versions of our products may remain vulnerable to attack.As cyber-attacks become more sophisticated, the need to develop, modify, upgrade or enhance our information technology infrastructure and measures to secure our business can lead to increased cybersecurity protection costs. Such costs may include making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants. These efforts come at the potential cost of revenues and human resources that could be utilized to continue to enhance our product offerings, and such increased costs may adversely affect our operating margins.Additionally, certain of our suppliers have in the past and may in the future experience cybersecurity attacks that can constrain their capacity and ability to meet our product demands. If our contract manufacturers and suppliers suffer future cyberattacks, our ability to ship products or otherwise fulfill our contractual obligations to our customers could be delayed or impaired which would adversely affect our business, financial results and customer relationships.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 1C. CybersecurityAt Aviat, cybersecurity processes, controls and technologies have been implemented to help facilitate the Company’s efforts to identify, assess and manage material risks associated with cybersecurity threats.Risk Management and StrategyThe Company has sought to leverage the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (the "NIST CSF") as a guideline for its cybersecurity framework and to help identify, assess and manage cybersecurity risks related to its business. The Company regularly engages third party experts, including cybersecurity assessors, consultants and auditors to evaluate and test our cybersecurity risk management systems and processes. The Company’s partnership with these third parties include regular audits and threat assessments. The Company requires all of its third-party information technology vendors to undergo evaluations by the Company’s internal data privacy and data security team as a part of efforts to assess, document and mitigate potential cybersecurity threats associated with the use of such vendors and the software, applications and services they provide.In addition, we undertake ongoing cyber risk assessments as part of our efforts to detect, evaluate and respond to potential cybersecurity threats, including regular testing by our internal information security team. We require all employees and contractors to participate in cybersecurity training designed to enhance their understanding of cyber threats and their ability to identify and escalate potential incidents. Our vulnerability management program is designed to identify, assess, and remediate cybersecurity threats in our systems, such as through penetration testing.35In 2024, we achieved International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 27001 certification. In 2025, we maintained our accreditation, reflecting our commitment to maintaining a robust information security management system. This internationally recognized standard demonstrates that we implemented risk-based controls to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability of critical data. The certification enhances our ability to manage cybersecurity threats, improve compliance posture and support customer trust in our information technology security practices.Incident ReportingIf cybersecurity incidents occur, certain of the Company’s executive leadership team, legal counsel, and Audit Committee would be briefed and a determination would be made as to whether such incident or vulnerability is deemed material to the Company. The Company’s incident response plan is tested annually to assess its operational effectiveness. We conduct an annual “tabletop” exercise during which we simulate cybersecurity incidents to help us prepare to respond to a cybersecurity incident and to identify areas for potential improvement.As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company does not believe it has encountered, and has not identified any risks from cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company. However, we acknowledge that cybersecurity threats are continually evolving, and the possibility of future cybersecurity incidents remains. Despite the implementation of our cybersecurity processes, our security measures cannot guarantee that a significant cyberattack will not occur. A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business. See “Item 1A, Risk Factors,” for additional information about the risks to our business associated with a breach or compromise to our information technology systems.GovernanceAviat’s Board of Directors has oversight of the Company’s cybersecurity risk as a component of its risk management. This includes prioritization of cybersecurity risks and the allocation of resources. The Board of Directors receives regular updates on the Company’s cybersecurity program. The Board of Directors have delegated its responsibility for risk management oversight to the Audit Committee, which regularly reviews Aviat’s cybersecurity program with the Company’s management. The Company’s management, including its Senior Director of Information Technology, CFO, and General Counsel, provide the Board of Directors updates regarding current and emerging cybersecurity threats, status of ongoing cybersecurity initiatives, certain incident reports and events, remediation efforts, and compliance with regulatory and industry standards.The Company’s Senior Director of Information Technology is primarily responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats, monitoring the effectiveness of our cybersecurity detection and response processes in countering current threats and providing updates to the executive team.Item 2. PropertiesThe Company leases office space, assembly facilities, repair and service centers, and warehouses in multiple locations in the United States and internationally. Aviat’s corporate headquarters is in Austin, Texas and most of its locations based in the United States are in Texas. Internationally, the Company leases facilities throughout Europe, North America, Africa and Asia. The Company owns one facility in Wellington, New Zealand. Refer to Note 4. Leases and Note 5.

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. In the discussion herein, the fiscal years ended June 27, 2025, June 28, 2024, and June 30, 2023, are referred to as “fiscal 2025”, “fiscal 2024” and “fiscal 2023”, respectively. Aviat’s fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to June 30. For a comparison of the results of operations for fiscal 2024 and 2023, refer to Aviat’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2024, filed with the SEC on October 4, 2024.OverviewAviat is a global supplier of microwave networking and access networking solutions, backed by an extensive suite of professional services and support. Aviat sells radios, routers, software and services integral to the functioning of data transport networks. Aviat has more than 3,000 customers and significant relationships with global service providers and private network operators. Aviat’s North America manufacturing base consists of a combination of contract manufacturing and assembly and testing operated in Austin, Texas by Aviat. Additionally, Aviat utilizes a contract manufacturer based in Asia for much of its international equipment demand. Aviat’s technology is underpinned by more than 400 patents. Aviat competes on the basis of Total Cost of Ownership (“TCO”), microwave radio expertise and solutions for mission critical communications.Acquisitions4RF LimitedOn July 2, 2024, the Company acquired 4RF Limited (“4RF”), a New Zealand company, Aviat purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of 4RF in an all-cash transaction for $18.2 million, net of $1.2 million cash acquired. 4F is a leading provider of industrial wireless access solutions, including narrowband point-to-point/multi-point radios and Private LTE and 5G routers. The acquisition of 4RF allows Aviat to expand its product offering for the global industrial wireless access markets including Private LTE/5G. See Note 12. Acquisitions of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Notes”) for further information.NEC’s Wireless Transport BusinessOn May 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Master Sale of Business Agreement (as amended on November 30, 2023, the “Purchase Agreement”) with NEC Corporation (“NEC”), to acquire NEC’s wireless transport business (the “NEC Transaction”). The Company completed the NEC Transaction on November 30, 2023.Prior to the acquisition date, NEC was a leader in wireless backhaul networks with an extensive installed base of their Pasolink series products. The completion of the NEC Transaction increases the scale of Aviat, enhances the Company’s product portfolio with a greater capability to innovate, and creates a more diversified business. Refer to Note 12. Acquisitions of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.The fair value of the consideration transferred at the closing of the NEC Transaction was comprised of (i) cash of $32.2 million, and (ii) the issuance of 736,750 shares or $22.3 million of Company common stock. Aggregate consideration transferred at closing was approximately $54.5 million, which is subject to certain post-closing adjustments. In fiscal 2025, the Company transferred consideration of $18.6 million to settle the post-closing working capital adjustment. The Company funded the cash portion of the NEC Transaction with Term Loan borrowings under its Credit Facility (as defined below). Refer to Note 7. Credit Facility and Debt of the Notes for further information.Redline Communications Group Inc.In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Redline Communications Group Inc. (“Redline”), for a purchase price of $20.4 million. Redline is a leading provider of mission-critical data infrastructure. See Note 12. Acquisitions of the Notes for further information.39Operations ReviewThe market for mobile backhaul continued to be the Company’s primary addressable market segment globally in fiscal 2025. In North America, the Company supported 5G and long-term evolution (“LTE”) deployments of its mobile operator customers, public safety network deployments for state and local governments, and private network implementations for utilities and other customers. In international markets, the Company’s business continued to rely on a combination of customers increasing their capacity to handle subscriber growth and the ongoing build-out of some large LTE and 5G deployments. Aviat’s position continues to be to support its customers for 5G and LTE readiness and ensure that its technology roadmap is well aligned with evolving market requirements. Aviat’s strength in turnkey and after-sale support services is a differentiating factor that wins business for the Company and enables it to expand its business with existing customers. Additionally, Aviat operates an e-commerce on-line platform, Aviat Store, that provides low-cost services, a simple experience, and fast delivery to mobile operators and private network customers. In 2025, new U.S. tariffs on foreign imports were proposed, and in certain cases implemented. In response, Aviat implemented mitigation strategies by optimizing its sourcing and operations to minimize the effects and took pricing actions to offset the impact of these tariffs. However, as disclosed in the “Risk Factors” section in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a number of factors could prevent the Company from achieving its objectives, including ongoing pricing pressures attributable to competition and macroeconomic conditions in the geographic markets that it serves. Fiscal 2025 Compared to Fiscal 2024RevenueThe Company manages its sales activities primarily on a geographic basis in North America and three international geographic regions: (1) Africa and the Middle East, (2) Europe and (3) Latin America and Asia Pacific. Revenue by region for fiscal 2025 and 2024 and the related changes were as follows: Fiscal Year(In thousands, except percentages)20252024$ Change% ChangeNorth America$207,606 $206,073 $1,533 0.7 %Africa and the Middle East49,428 48,884 544 1.1 %Europe31,713 24,608 7,105 28.9 %Latin America and Asia Pacific145,859 128,518 17,341 13.5 %Total Revenue$434,606 $408,083 $26,523 6.5 %The Company achieved revenue growth of 6.5% in fiscal 2025 primarily driven by contributions from the NEC Transaction and the 4RF acquisition, and 21% growth in managed services driven by increased demand on a larger install base. This was partially offset by lower demand for software offerings and equipment, which both decreased 3%. During fiscal 2025, contributions from the NEC Transaction and 4RF acquisition totaled $126.8 million and $25.3 million, respectively. Revenue in North America increased by $1.5 million in fiscal 2025 primarily due to contributions of the 4RF acquisition of $18.8 million, partially offset by lower mobile operator demand, which decreased $17 million.Revenue in Africa and the Middle East increased by $0.5 million in fiscal 2025 primarily due to increased demand of managed services and software offerings on a larger install base, which increased 36% and 42%, respectively, partially offset by a 12% decrease in equipment sales.Revenue in Europe increased by $7.1 million in fiscal 2025 primarily due to increased equipment sales to mobile operators in the region. Revenue in Latin America and Asia Pacific increased by $17.3 million in fiscal 2025 primarily due to higher demand for Pasolink projects and services increasing 37%, higher demand for software which increased 13%, and contributions from the 4RF acquisition of $5.4 million, partially offset by lower equipment sales to mobile operators.40 Fiscal Year(In thousands, except percentages)20252024$ Change% ChangeProduct sales$287,657 $274,205 $13,452 4.9 %Services146,949 133,878 13,071 9.8 %Total Revenue$434,606 $408,083 $26,523 6.5 %Revenue from product sales and services increased by 4.9% and 9.8%, respectively in fiscal 2025 primarily due to the same overall factors of revenue growth discussed previously.Gross Margin Fiscal Year(In thousands, except percentages)20252024$ Change% ChangeRevenue$434,606 $408,083 $26,523 6.5 %Cost of revenue295,170 263,351 31,819 12.1 %Gross margin$139,436 $144,732 $(5,296)(3.7)%% of revenue32.1 %35.5 %Product margin %27.7 %37.4 %Service margin %40.7 %31.6 %Gross margin for fiscal 2025 decreased by $(5.3) million, while gross margin as a percentage of revenue reduced by 3.4 percentage points due to higher volumes on lower margin sales.Research and Development Expenses Fiscal Year(In thousands, except percentages)20252024$ Change% ChangeResearch and development expenses$35,768 $36,426 $(658)(1.8)%% of revenue8.2 %8.9 %Research and development expenses decreased by $(0.7) million in fiscal 2025 primarily due to synergies achieved leading to cost optimization from the NEC Transaction.Selling and Administrative Expenses Fiscal Year(In thousands, except percentages)20252024$ Change% ChangeSelling and administrative expenses$89,482 $85,038 $4,444 5.2 %% of revenue20.6 %20.8 %Selling and administrative expenses increased by $4.4 million in fiscal 2025 primarily due to merger and acquisition expenses and additional costs resulting from the NEC Transaction and 4RF acquisition.Restructuring Charges Fiscal Year(In thousands, except percentages)20252024$ Change% ChangeRestructuring charges$3,611 $3,867 $(256)(6.6)%% of revenue0.8 %0.9 %During fiscal 2025 restructuring charges were $3.6 million, a decrease of $(0.3) million compared to fiscal 2024.

The prior year comparison period includes restructuring charges primarily associated with the NEC Transaction.41The Company’s success in restructuring initiatives has enabled it to restructure specific groups to optimize skill sets and align its organizational structure to execute on strategic deliverables, in addition to aligning cost structure with the core business.Interest Expense, Net Fiscal Year(In thousands, except percentages)20252024$ Change% ChangeInterest expense, net$6,058 $2,337 $3,721 159.2 %Interest expense, net increased by $3.7 million in fiscal 2025 primarily due to interest expense incurred on incremental Term Loan borrowings.Other Expense, Net Fiscal Year(In thousands, except percentages)20252024$ Change% ChangeOther expense, net$941 $158 $783 495.6 %Other expense, net increased by $0.8 million in fiscal 2025 primarily as a result of foreign exchange rate movement.Income Taxes Fiscal Year(In thousands, except percentages)20252024$ Change% ChangeIncome before income taxes$3,576 $16,906 $(13,330)(78.8)%Provision for income taxes2,235 6,146 (3,911)(63.6)%As % of income before income taxes62.5 %36.4 %The Company estimates its annual effective tax rate at the end of each reporting period, and records the tax effect of certain discrete items in the interim period in which they occur, including changes in judgment about uncertain tax positions and deferred tax valuation allowances.Tax expense was $2.2 million in fiscal 2025 and $6.1 million in fiscal 2024. Tax expense in fiscal 2025 was primarily attributable to tax expense for the U.S. entity, profitable foreign subsidiaries, and withholding taxes, partially offset by a Canada valuation allowance release. Tax expense in fiscal 2024 was primarily attributable to tax expense related to U.S. and profitable foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by Canada valuation allowance release.On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was enacted. We continue to analyze the OBBBA and at this time do not expect a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.Fiscal 2024 Compared to Fiscal 2023For a comparison of the results of operations for fiscal 2024 and 2023, refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of Aviat’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2024, filed with the SEC on October 4, 2024.Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial StrategiesSources of CashAs of June 27, 2025, the Company’s total cash and cash equivalents were $59.7 million. Approximately $22.2 million, or 37% was held in the United States. The remaining balance of $37.5 million, or 63% was held outside the United States. Of the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries on June 27, 2025, $37.1 million was held in jurisdictions where its undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested, and if repatriated, would be subject to foreign withholding taxes.42Operating ActivitiesOperating cash flows is presented as net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.7 million for fiscal 2025, compared with $30.5 million in the prior year. The $(24.8) million decrease is primarily attributable to decreased net income prior to non-cash adjustments and overall decreases in the net changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to the prior year. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in $(16.8) million of cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2025, compared to $(2.5) million in fiscal 2024. The $(14.3) million increase compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to increases in inventory as well as an increase in accounts receivable which is primarily driven by increased sales in the year and timing of receiving payments. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable due to purchasing of increased inventory as well as the timing of payments as compared to the prior year.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $28.5 million for fiscal 2025, compared to $35.2 million in the prior year. The $6.7 million decrease is driven by prior year cash paid for the NEC Transaction of $32.2 million compared to current year net cash paid for the 4RF acquisition of $18.2 million. This is partially offset by an increase in purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $10.3 million compared to the prior year.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments under the Company’s Credit Facility and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities was $18.7 million for fiscal 2025, compared with $48.7 million in the prior year. The $(30.0) million decrease is primarily due to payment of deferred consideration of $18.6 million related to the NEC acquisition and repayment of $50.6 million in the current year on Term Loan borrowings compared to $1.3 million in the prior year. The decrease is partially offset by increased net borrowings of $15.0 million on the Revolver (as defined below) in the current year.As of June 27, 2025, the Company’s sources of liquidity consisted of $59.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, $51.3 million of available credit under its Credit Facility, and future collections of receivables from customers. The Company regularly requires letters of credit from certain customers, and, from time to time, these letters of credit are discounted without recourse shortly after shipment occurs in order to meet immediate liquidity requirements and to reduce its credit and sovereign risk. Historically, the Company’s primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and credit facilities.The Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents, the available borrowings under its Credit Facility, the availability under its effective shelf registration statement and future cash collections from customers will be sufficient to provide for its anticipated requirements and plans for cash for at least the next 12 months. In addition, the Company believes these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to provide for its anticipated requirements and plans for cash beyond the next 12 months.Available Credit Facility, Borrowings and Repayment of DebtThe Company entered into a Secured Credit Facility Agreement (the “Credit Facility”), dated May 9, 2023, amended as of November 22, 2023 and October 18, 2024, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing lender and Wells Fargo Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and Regions Capital Markets as lenders. The Credit Facility provides for a $75.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) and a $75.0 million Term Loan Facility (the “Term Loan”) with a maturity date of October 18, 2029. The $75.0 million Revolver can be borrowed with a $10.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit, and a $10.0 million swingline loan sub-limit. On August 28, 2025, the Company entered into an amendment under the Credit Facility to increase the Term Loan and Revolver commitments by $20 million for each instrument. Refer to Note 7. Credit Facility and Debt and Note 16. Subsequent Events of the Notes for further information.In November 2023, the Company borrowed $50.0 million against the Term Loan to primarily settle the cash portion of the consideration associated with the NEC Transaction. Refer to Note 12. Acquisitions of the Notes for further information. 43As of June 27, 2025, the available credit under the Revolver was $51.3 million, reflecting the available limit of $60.0 million less outstanding letters of credit of $8.7 million. The Company borrowed $95.0 million and repaid $80.0 million against the Revolver in fiscal 2025. The Company borrowed $75.0 million and repaid $50.6 million against the Term Loan in fiscal 2025. As of June 27, 2025, the Company had $73.1 million outstanding under its Term Loan and $15.0 million borrowings under its Revolver.Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at either: (a) Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus the applicable margin; or (b) the Base Rate plus the applicable margin. The pricing levels for interest rate margins are determined based on the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio as determined and adjusted quarterly. As of June 27, 2025, the applicable margin on Adjusted Term SOFR and Base Rate borrowings was 2.8% and 1.8%, respectively. The effective rate of interest on the outstanding Term Loan borrowings as of June 27, 2025, was 6.9%.The Credit Facility requires the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio to be greater than 1.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of the Company. The Credit Facility also requires that the Company maintain a maximum leverage ratio of 3.00 times Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), with a step-down to 2.75 times EBITDA after four full quarters, and 2.50 times EBITDA after eight full quarters. The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets, permit a change in control, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, make certain restricted payments, and enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to customary exceptions. As of June 27, 2025, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Credit Facility.Restructuring PaymentsThe Company had liabilities for restructuring activities totaling $1.8 million as of June 27, 2025, which was classified as current and are expected to be paid in cash within the next 12 months. The Company expects to fund the future payments with available cash and cash provided by operations. Refer to Note 8. Restructuring Activities of the Notes for further information.Financial Risk ManagementIn the normal course of doing business, the Company is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The Company employs established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks.Exchange Rate RiskThe Company conducts business globally in numerous currencies and is therefore exposed to foreign currency risks. From time to time, the Company uses derivative instruments to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes or make speculative investments in foreign currencies.The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the change in fair value of specific non-functional currency assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. All balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely offset by re-measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. The Company did not have any foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of June 27, 2025, or June 28, 2024.Net foreign exchange (gains) losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 were $(0.8) million, $(0.3) million and $1.0 million, respectively.Certain of the Company’s international business are transacted in non-U.S. dollar (“USD”) currencies. From time to time, the Company utilizes foreign currency hedging instruments to minimize the currency risk of non-USD transactions. The impact of translating the assets and liabilities of foreign operations to USD is included as a component of stockholders’ equity. As of June 27, 2025, and June 28, 2024, the cumulative translation adjustment decreased stockholders’ equity by $18.8 million and $19.3 million, respectively.44Interest Rate RiskThe Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its cash equivalents and borrowings under its Credit Facility.Exposure on Cash Equivalents The Company had $59.7 million in total cash and cash equivalents as of June 27, 2025. Cash equivalents totaled $6.4 million as of June 27, 2025, and were comprised of money market funds and bank certificates of deposit. Cash equivalents have been recorded at fair value. Fair value is measured using inputs that fall into a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value based on observability of such inputs. Refer to Note 6. Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities of the Notes for further information. The Company’s cash equivalents earn interest at fixed rates; therefore, changes in interest rates will not generate a gain or loss on these investments unless they are sold prior to maturity. The weighted-average days to maturity for cash equivalents held as of June 27, 2025, was approximately 27 days, and these investments had an average yield of approximately 5.0% per annum. A 10% change in interest rates on the Company’s cash equivalents is not expected to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Exposure on BorrowingsAs of June 27, 2025, the Company had $73.1 million outstanding under its Term Loan and $15.0 million outstanding under its Revolver. Refer to Note 7 Credit Facility and Debt of the Notes for further information. The Company’s borrowings under the current Credit Facility bear interest at either: (a) Adjusted Term SOFR plus the applicable margin; or (b) the Base Rate plus the applicable margin. The pricing levels for interest rate margins are determined based on the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio as determined and adjusted quarterly. As of June 27, 2025, the applicable margin on Adjusted Term SOFR and Base Rate borrowings was 2.8% and 1.8%, respectively. The effective rate of interest on the Company’s outstanding Term Loan borrowings as of June 27, 2025, was 6.9%.A 10% change in interest rates is estimated to have a $0.5 million impact on annual interest expense on the Company’s outstanding long-term debt as of June 27, 2025.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us.These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected.The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:•revenue recognition for estimated costs to complete over-time services;•inventory valuation and provision for excess and obsolete inventory losses; •income taxes valuation; and•business combinations.In some cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Board.45The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies or estimates. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1. The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes. In preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply those accounting policies. We consider the estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.Besides estimates that meet the “critical” accounting estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, including for estimates that we do not deem “critical.”Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue by applying the following five-step approach: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Revenue from services includes certain network planning and design, engineering, installation and commissioning, extended warranty, customer support, consulting, training, and education. Maintenance and support services are generally offered to our customers and recognized over a specified period of time and from sales and subsequent renewals of maintenance and support contracts. The network planning and design, engineering and installation related services noted are recognized based on an over-time recognition model using the cost-input method. Certain judgment is required when estimating total contract costs and progress to completion on the over-time arrangements, as well as whether a loss is expected to be incurred on the contract. The cost estimation process for these contracts is based on the knowledge and experience of the Company’s project managers, engineers, and financial professionals. Changes in job performance and job conditions are factors that influence estimates of the total costs to complete those contracts and the Company’s revenue recognition. If circumstances arise that change the original estimates of revenues, costs, or extent of progress toward completion, revisions to the estimates are made in a timely manner. These revisions may result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs, and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the circumstances that gave rise to the revision become known to us. As of June 27, 2025, favorable and unfavorable changes in contract estimates are not considered material for each period presented. We perform ongoing profitability analysis of our service contracts accounted for under this method to determine whether the latest estimates of revenues, costs, and profits require updating. In rare circumstances if these estimates indicate that the contract will be unprofitable, the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately. As of June 27, 2025, contract losses recognized are not considered material during each period presented and there are no material loss contracts for each period presented.46Inventory Valuation and Provisions for Excess and Obsolete LossesOur inventories have been valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance with the risk of excess or obsolete inventory due to changing technology and customer requirements, and new product introductions. The manufacturing of our products is handled primarily by contract manufacturers. Our contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our forecast of product demand. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, the stage of the product life cycle, anticipated end of product life and production requirements. Several factors may influence the sale and use of our inventories, including decisions to exit a product line, technological change, new product development and competing product offerings. These factors could result in a change in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be overstated or understated. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we would be required to recognize such costs in cost of product sales and services in our consolidated statements of operations at the time of such determination. In the case of goods which have been written down below cost at the close of a fiscal quarter, such reduced amount is considered the new lower cost basis for subsequent accounting purposes, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. We did not make any material changes in the valuation methodology during the past three fiscal years.Our customer service inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We carry service parts because we generally provide product warranty for 12 to 36 months and earn revenue by providing enhanced and extended warranty and repair service during and beyond this warranty period. Customer service inventories consist of both component parts, which are primarily used to repair defective units, and finished units, which are provided for customer use permanently or on a temporary basis while the defective unit is being repaired. We record adjustments to reduce the carrying value of customer service inventories to their net realizable value. Factors influencing these adjustments include product life cycles, end of service life plans and volume of enhanced or extended warranty service contracts. Estimates of net realizable value involve significant estimates and judgments about the future, and revisions would be required if these factors differ from our estimates.Income Taxes ValuationWe record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities of amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Certain judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the opening and closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period in which such determination is made.We record deferred taxes by applying enacted statutory tax rates to the respective jurisdictions and follow specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and provide necessary valuation allowances as required. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on meeting certain criteria in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). One of the major criteria is the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carry-back or carry-forward periods available under the tax law. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and our ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.47The accounting estimates related to the liability for uncertain tax position require us to make judgments regarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate our reserves for the uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will be the same as these estimates. These estimates are updated quarterly based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively settled issues.Business CombinationsThe Company accounts for acquisitions as required by FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions to properly allocate purchase price consideration between the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company leverages independent third-party valuations in determining the estimated fair values of acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities. If assumptions or estimates used in determining fair values change based on information that becomes available during the one-year period from the acquisition date, we record measurement period adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Impact of Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1. The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes for a full description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on the consolidated financial position and results of operations.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskIn the normal course of doing business, the Company is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The Company has established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks. For a discussion of such policies and procedures and the related risks, see “Financial Risk Management” in “Item 7.

Subsequent Events8849Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Aviat Networks, Inc.Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Aviat Networks, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity, for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 27, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 27, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated September 10, 2025, expressed an adverse opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Revenue Recognition — Service Revenues - Estimated Costs to Complete - Refer to Note 3 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company recognizes revenue from two primary sources: products and services. Revenues from services include revenues from network planning and design, engineering and installation-related services. Long term contracts for these services are recognized based on an over-time recognition model using the cost-input method. Judgment is required when estimating total contract costs. The cost estimation process for these contracts is based on the knowledge and experience of the Company’s project managers, engineers, and financial professionals. Changes in job performance and job conditions are factors that influence estimates of the total costs to complete those contracts and the Company’s revenue recognition.We identified estimated costs to complete for open over-time revenue contracts at year end as a critical audit matter. The determination of the total estimated cost and progress toward completion requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the revenue recognized each period. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions and estimates over the duration of these contracts.50How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to management’s estimates of costs to complete for open over-time revenue contracts used to recognize service revenues included the following, among others:•We selected a sample of revenue contracts and performed the following: ◦Tested the accuracy and completeness of the costs incurred to

INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1. The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThe CompanyAviat Networks, Inc. (“Aviat,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) designs, manufactures, and sells wireless networking and access networking solutions and services to mobile and fixed telephone service providers, private network operators, government agencies, transportation and utility companies, public safety agencies and broadcast system operators across the globe. Aviat’s products include broadband wireless access base stations and customer premises equipment for fixed and mobile, point-to-point digital microwave radio systems for access, backhaul, trunking and license-exempt applications, supporting new network deployments, network expansion, and capacity upgrades.Basis of PresentationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform to the current period consolidated financial statement presentation.Aviat’s fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the Friday nearest to June 30. This was June 27, 2025, for fiscal 2025, June 28, 2024, for fiscal 2024 and June 30, 2023, for fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 includes 52 weeks. In the notes to consolidated financial statements, we refer to our fiscal years as “fiscal 2025”, “fiscal 2024” and “fiscal 2023.”Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments affecting the amounts reported and related disclosures. Estimates are based upon historical factors, current circumstances and the experience and judgment of management. The Company evaluates estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in making these evaluations. Changes in such estimates, based on more accurate information, or different assumptions or conditions, may affect amounts reported in future periods. Such estimates affect significant items, including revenue recognition, provision for uncollectible receivables, inventory valuation, goodwill and identified intangible assets in business combinations, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and uncertainties in income taxes. Actual results may differ materially from estimates.Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted CashAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments. Investments with an original maturity of greater than three months are accounted for as short-term investments and are classified as such at the time of purchase.The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held at several major financial institutions, which often significantly exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. However, a substantial portion of the cash equivalents is invested in prime money market funds which are backed by the securities in the fund.Cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage under the terms of contractual agreements are recorded as restricted cash. The Company’s restricted cash is included in long-term other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and represents the cash balance on its disability insurance voluntary plan account that cannot be used for any operating purposes other than to pay benefits to the insured employees.58Significant ConcentrationsThe Company typically invoices customers for the sales order (or contract) value of the related products delivered at various milestones, including order receipt, shipment, installation and acceptance and for services when rendered. The Company’s trade receivables are derived from sales to customers located in North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific.Accounts receivable is presented net of allowance for expected credit losses to reflect any loss anticipated on the collection of the Company’s trade receivable balances. The allowance for expected credit losses is based on historical loss information, customer financial condition, and economic and geopolitical conditions for the locations where the Company’s customers operate. Accounts receivable amounts are written off when attempts to collect outstanding amounts have been exhausted or there are other indicators that the amounts are no longer collectible.The Company regularly requires letters of credit from certain customers and, from time to time, discounts these letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions. The discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. Under these arrangements, collection risk is fully transferred to the financial institutions. Financing charges on discounting the letters of credit are recorded as interest expense. During fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. As of June 27, 2025, and June 28, 2024, no customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and from time to time, financial instruments used in foreign currency hedging activities. The Company invests excess cash primarily in prime money market funds and certificates of deposit. The Company is exposed to credit risks related to such instruments in the event of default or decrease in credit-worthiness of the issuers of the investments. Risks associated with the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are mitigated by banking with creditworthy institutions.The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable, as the majority of customers are large, well-established companies. However, in certain circumstances, the Company may require letters of credit, additional guarantees or advance payments. The Company maintains allowances for expected credit losses, but historically has not experienced any significant losses related to any particular geographic area. The Company’s customers are primarily in the telecommunications industry, and its accounts receivable is exposed to similar credit risk characteristics as that industry.InventoriesThe Company engages third parties to manufacture its products and procures its raw materials from third-party suppliers. In addition, certain strategic component inventory is consigned to third-party manufacturers. Other components included in the Company’s products are sourced from various suppliers and are principally industry standard parts and components that are available from multiple vendors. The inability of a contract manufacturer or supplier to fulfill the Company’s supply requirements or changes in their financial or business condition could disrupt the Company’s ability to supply quality products to its customers, and thereby may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and operating results.Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is determined using standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a weighted-average first-in-first-out basis, or in certain circumstances actual cost. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements. Inventory adjustments are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and any subsequent improvements in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.59The Company stocks customer service related inventories such as service parts because the Company provides product warranties for 12 to 36 months and earns revenue by providing enhanced and extended warranty and repair service during and beyond this warranty period. Customer service related inventories consist of both component parts, which are primarily used to repair defective units, and finished units, which are provided for customer use permanently or on a temporary basis while the defective unit is being repaired. The Company records adjustments to reduce the carrying value of customer service inventories to their net realizable value. Factors influencing these adjustments include product life cycles, end of service life plans and volume of enhanced or extended warranty service contracts. Estimates of net realizable value involve significant estimates and judgments about the future, and revisions would be required if these factors differ from estimates. Refer to Note 5. Balance Sheet Components for further information.Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are stated on the basis of cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company capitalizes costs of software, consulting services, hardware and other related costs incurred to purchase or develop internal-use software. Costs incurred during preliminary project assessment, re-engineering, training and application maintenance are charged to expense. Depreciation is charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements. The useful lives of the assets are generally as follows:Buildings40 yearsLeasehold improvements2 to 10 yearsSoftware and equipment2 to 5 yearsExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and are included in cost of revenues and selling and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or retired are removed from the respective property accounts, and any gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations.Business CombinationsThe Company accounts for acquisitions as required by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions to properly allocate purchase price consideration between the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company leverages independent third-party valuations in determining the estimated fair values of acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities. If assumptions or estimates used in determining fair values change based on information that becomes available during the one-year period from the acquisition date, we record measurement period adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.GoodwillThe Company accounts for goodwill as required by FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”). The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur that may suggest that the fair value of such assets cannot support the carrying value. ASC 350 gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then the quantitative impairment test shall be used to identify the impairment and measure the amount of an impairment loss to be recognized (if applicable).60The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of its fourth fiscal quarter. The Company has one reporting unit. A qualitative assessment was performed for fiscal 2025. This assessment considered changes in the Company’s projected future cash flows and discount rates, recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions. Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of its reporting unit was higher than its carrying value and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required. Refer to Note 10. Segment and Geographic Information, Note 12. Acquisitions, and Note 14. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.Valuation of Long-Lived AssetsThe Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangibles, and property, plant and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the assigned useful lives may no longer be appropriate. Impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets. If impairment exists, the impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups. The Company’s estimate of future cash flows is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance, growth rates and other factors. The actual cash flows realized from these assets may vary significantly from estimates. There were no impairment losses recorded for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. The Company amortizes the cost of finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which approximates the pattern of economic benefit. Refer to Note 14. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.WarrantiesOn product sales, the Company provides for future warranty costs upon product delivery. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the type of product sold and country of delivery. In the case of products sold by the Company, product warranties generally start from the delivery date and continue for one to three years, depending on the terms.Many of the Company’s products are manufactured to customer specifications and their acceptance is based on meeting those specifications. Factors that affect our warranty liabilities include the number of product units subject to warranty protection, historical experience and management’s judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities every quarter and make adjustments to the liabilities as necessary. Refer to Note 5. Balance Sheet Components for further information.LeasesThe Company leases office space, assembly facilities, repair and service centers, and warehouses globally under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based on the remaining lease term at commencement date is used in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included within the right-of-use asset and lease liability calculation. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of the Company’s lease arrangements include non-lease components and the Company accounts for non-lease components together with lease components for all such lease arrangements.Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Refer to Note 4. Leases for further information. 61Foreign Currency TranslationThe functional currency of certain of the Company’s international subsidiaries is the United States (“U.S.”) dollar. Determination of the functional currency is dependent upon the economic environment in which an entity operates as well as the customers and suppliers the entity conducts business with. Changes in facts and circumstances may occur which could lead to a change in the functional currency of that entity. Accordingly, all non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are re-measured into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate as of the applicable balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured at historical rates.All other international subsidiaries use their respective local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.Gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions and re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies are included in other expense (income), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, based on the nature of the transactions. Net foreign exchange (gains) losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 were $(0.8) million, $(0.3) million and $1.0 million, respectively.Retirement BenefitsThe Company provides retirement benefits to substantially all employees primarily through its defined contribution retirement plans. These plans have matching and savings elements. Contributions by the Company to these retirement plans are based on profits and employees’ savings with no other funding requirements. Contributions to retirement plans are expensed as incurred. Retirement plan expense incurred in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $3.3 million, $2.8 million, and $2.1 million, respectively. Retirement plan expenses are included in cost of revenues, research and development, and selling and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue by applying the five-step approach in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”): (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Refer to Note 3. Revenue Recognition for further information.Cost of Product Sales and ServicesCost of sales consists primarily of materials, labor and overhead costs incurred internally and amounts incurred for contract manufacturers to produce the Company’s products, personnel and other implementation costs incurred to install the Company’s products and train customer personnel, and customer service and third party original equipment manufacturer costs to provide continuing support to customers. Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of costs of product sales in the consolidated statements of operations because they are also included as a component of revenue billed to customers.Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were not material during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023.Presentation of Transactional Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Government AuthoritiesTransactional taxes such as sales and use tax collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis.62Research and Development CostsThe Company’s research and development costs, which include costs in connection with new product development, improvement of existing products, process improvement, and product use technologies, are generally charged to operations in the period in which they are incurred. For certain software projects under development, development costs are capitalized during the period between determining technological feasibility of the product and commercial release and are included in long-term other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The amortization of capitalized development costs begins upon commercial release, generally over three years. To date, the amount of development costs capitalized and amortized have not been material.Share-Based CompensationThe Company has one stock incentive plan for its employees and non-employee directors. The stock incentive plan permits the Company to grant share-based awards in the form of options, restricted stock awards and units and performance share awards and units.The estimated grant date fair value of share-based awards is amortized over the requisite service period or vesting term. For non-qualified stock options, the Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to estimate the fair value as of the grant date. The determination of the fair value of stock option awards is affected by the Company’s stock price and assumptions regarding a number of variables. These variables include the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. Due to the inherent limitations of option valuation models, including consideration of future events that are unpredictable and the estimation process utilized in determining the valuation of the share-based awards, the ultimate value realized by the Company’s employees may vary significantly from the amounts expensed in its financial statements. For restricted stock awards and units and performance share awards and units with performance conditions, the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant is used to estimate the fair value. For performance share awards and units with market conditions, the fair value is estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model as of the grant date. The Company recognizes forfeitures of share-based awards as they occur.The Company recognizes compensation cost for share-based payment awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For an award that has a graded vesting schedule, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards. The amount of compensation cost recognized at any date must at least equal the portion of the grant-date value of the award that is vested at that date. For awards with a performance condition vesting feature, share-based compensation costs are recognized when achievement of the performance conditions is considered probable. Any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed if the performance condition is not satisfied or if it is not probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. For awards with a market condition vesting feature, share-based compensation costs are recognized over the period the requisite service is rendered, regardless of when, and if ever, the market condition is satisfied. Restructuring ChargesRestructuring charges represent expenses incurred in connection with certain cost reduction programs that the Company has implemented, and consists of the costs of employee termination costs, lease and other contract termination charges and other costs of exiting activities or geographies. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is measured at its fair value when the liability is incurred. Expenses for one-time termination benefits are recognized at the date the employee is notified, unless the employee must provide future service, in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period. The Company recognizes severance benefits provided as part of an ongoing benefit arrangement when the payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to termination of an operating lease or contract are measured and recognized at fair value when the contract does not have any future economic benefit to the entity and the fair value of the liability is determined based on the present value of the remaining lease obligations, adjusted for the effects of deferred items recognized under the lease, and reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property. The assumptions in determining such estimates include anticipated timing of sublease rentals and estimates of sublease rental receipts and related costs based on market conditions. All other costs related to an exit or disposal activity are expensed as incurred. Refer to Note 8. Restructuring Activities for further information.63Income Taxes and Related UncertaintiesThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as measured by tax rates at which temporary differences are expected to reverse as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available information, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.The Company is required to compute its income taxes in each federal, state, and foreign jurisdiction the Company operates. This process requires that the Company estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. The income tax effects of the differences identified are classified as long-term deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s judgments, assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, the Company’s interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax laws or the Company’s interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations. The Company must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on this assessment, establish a valuation allowance, if required. The Company’s determination of its valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which the Company operates. To the extent the Company establishes a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period, the change is reflected with a corresponding increase or decrease to the Company’s tax provision on the consolidated statements of operations.The Company uses a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized for uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires the Company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires the Company to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. Uncertain tax positions are re-evaluated by the Company on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period. Refer to Note 11. Income Taxes for further information.Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU expands reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that are regularly presented to the chief operating decision maker. The disclosures required under ASU 2023-07 are also required for public entities with a single reportable segment. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company’s annual reporting beginning in fiscal 2025 and for interim periods beginning in fiscal 2026. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 for the year ended June 27, 2025. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Accounting Standards Not Yet AdoptedIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU enhances the transparency and usefulness of income tax information through improvements to disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company’s annual reporting beginning in fiscal 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs issued by the FASB. The Company determined at this time that all other ASUs issued but not yet adopted are either not applicable or are expected to have a minimal impact on its financial position and results of operations.64Note 2. Net Income per Share of Common StockNet income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of shares of its outstanding common stock.The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net income per share: Fiscal Year(In thousands, except per share amounts)202520242023Numerator:   Net income$1,341 $10,760 $10,169 Denominator:   Weighted average shares outstanding, basic12,681 12,182 11,358    Effect of potentially dilutive equivalent shares145 274 497    Weighted average shares outstanding, diluted12,826 12,456 11,855 Net income per share:   Basic$0.11 $0.88 $0.90    Diluted$0.10 $0.86 $0.86 The following table summarizes the weighted-average equity awards that were excluded from the diluted net income per share calculations since they were anti-dilutive:  Fiscal Year(In thousands)202520242023Stock options314 319 194 Restricted stock units and performance stock units135 23 21 Total shares of common stock excluded449 342 215 Note 3. Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue by applying the following five-step approach: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Many of the Company’s arrangements with customers contain multiple performance obligations and therefore promises to provide multiple goods and services. The Company evaluates each promised good and service in a contract to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation or should be accounted for as a combined performance obligation. For goods and services determined to be distinct we have concluded that they provide a benefit to the customer either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, without having the need for significant integration or customization.Revenue from product sales, recognized at a point-in-time, is generated predominately from the sales of products manufactured by third-party manufacturers to whom we have outsourced our manufacturing processes. Printed circuit assemblies, mechanical housings, and packaged modules are manufactured by contract manufacturing partners, with periodic business reviews of material levels and obsolescence. Product assembly, product testing, complete system integration, and system testing may either be performed within our own facilities or at the locations of our third-party manufacturers.65Revenue from services includes certain network planning and design, engineering, installation and commissioning (“field services”), extended warranty, hosted software-as-a-service (“SaaS”), customer support, consulting, training, and education. Maintenance and support services are generally offered to our customers and recognized over a specified period of time and from sales and subsequent renewals of maintenance and support contracts. The network planning and design, engineering and installation related services noted are recognized based on an over-time recognition model using the cost-input method. Certain judgment is required when estimating total contract costs and progress to completion on the over-time arrangements, as well as whether a loss is expected to be incurred on the contract. The cost estimation process for these contracts is based on the knowledge and experience of the Company’s project managers, engineers, and financial professionals. Changes in job performance and job conditions are factors that influence estimates of the total costs to complete those contracts and the Company’s revenue recognition. If circumstances arise that change the original estimates of revenues, costs, or extent of progress toward completion, revisions to the estimates are made in a timely manner. These revisions may result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs, and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the circumstances that gave rise to the revision become known to us. We perform ongoing profitability analysis of our service contracts accounted for under this method to determine whether the latest estimates of revenues, costs, and profits require updating. In rare circumstances if these estimates indicate that the contract will be unprofitable, the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately. We establish billing terms at the time project deliverables and milestones are agreed. Revenues recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are classified as unbilled receivables and if invoicing is ahead of revenue recognized it is classified as an unearned liability on the consolidated balance sheets.In addition, shipping documents and customer acceptances, when applicable, are used to verify delivery and transfer of control. We typically satisfy our performance obligations upon shipment or delivery of product depending on the contractual terms. Payment terms to customers generally range from net 30 to 120 days from invoice, which are considered to be standard payment terms. Revenue recognition does not necessarily follow payment terms as there are a number of scenarios where they would be different. Recognition follows contractual terms and those vary depending on the nature of the performance obligation being satisfied. These timing differences result in contract assets and liabilities as discussed below. We assess our ability to collect from our customers based primarily on the creditworthiness and past payment history of the customer.While our customers do not have the right of return, we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based primarily on historical trends. Actual product returns may be different than what was estimated. These factors and unanticipated changes in economic and industry condition could make actual results differ from our return estimates.We present transactional taxes such as sales and use tax collected from customers and remitted to government authorities on a net basis.Bill-and-Hold SalesCertain customer arrangements consist of bill-and-hold characteristics under which control has been transferred to the customer, while we retain physical possession of the product. We evaluate bill-and-hold arrangement criteria to determine when the customer has obtained control. Once control has been obtained by the customer, they can direct or determine the use of the bill-and-hold inventory while we retain physical possession of the product until it is installed at a customer site at a point in time in the future.Termination RightsThe contract term is determined on the basis of the period over which the parties to the contract have present enforceable rights and obligations. Certain customer contracts include a termination for convenience clause that allows the customer to terminate services without penalty, upon advance notification. We concluded that the duration of support contracts does not extend beyond the non-cancellable portion of the contract.Variable ConsiderationThe consideration associated with customer contracts is generally fixed. Variable consideration includes discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, incentives, penalties, or other similar items. The amount of consideration that can vary is not a substantial portion of total consideration.66Variable consideration estimates are re-assessed at each reporting period until a final outcome is determined. The changes to the original transaction price due to a change in estimated variable consideration are applied on a retrospective basis, with the adjustment recorded in the period in which the change occurs. Changes to variable consideration are tracked and material changes disclosed.Stand-alone Selling PriceStand-alone selling price is the price at which an entity would sell a good or service on a stand-alone (or separate) basis at contract inception. Under the model, the observable price of a good or service sold separately provides the best evidence of stand-alone selling price. However, in certain situations, stand-alone selling prices will not be readily observable and the entity must estimate the stand-alone selling price.When allocating on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, any discount provided in the contract is allocated proportionately to all of the performance obligations in the contract.The majority of products and services that we offer have readily observable selling prices. For products and services that do not, we estimate stand-alone selling price using the market assessment approach based on expected selling price and adjust those prices as necessary to reflect our costs and margins. As part of our stand-alone selling price policy, we review product pricing on a periodic basis to identify any significant changes and revise our expected selling price assumptions as appropriate.Shipping and HandlingShipping and handling costs are included as a component of costs of product sales in our consolidated statements of operations because they are also included in revenue that we bill our customers.Costs to Obtain a ContractWe have assessed the treatment of costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. We capitalize sales commissions related to multi-year service contracts, and amortize the asset over the period of benefit, which is the estimated service period. Sales commissions paid on contract renewals, including service contract renewals, is commensurate with the sales commissions paid on the initial contracts. The capitalized sales commissions are included in other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. We have not identified any impairments during the periods presented.We elected the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred when the amortization period of the related asset is one year or less. These costs are recorded as selling and administrative expense and included in the consolidated balance sheet as accrued expenses until paid. Amortization expense was not material for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023.Contract Balances, Performance Obligations, and BacklogThe following table provides information about receivables and liabilities from contracts with customers:(In thousands)June 27, 2025June 28, 2024Contract AssetsAccounts receivable, net$180,321 $158,013 Unbilled receivables105,870 90,525 Capitalized commissions3,921 3,269 Contract LiabilitiesAdvance payments and unearned revenue$73,735 $58,839 Unearned revenue, long-term8,063 7,413 Significant changes in contract balances may arise as a result of recognition over time for services, transfer of control for equipment, and periodic payments (both in arrears and in advance).67From time to time, the Company may experience unforeseen events that could result in a change to the scope or price associated with an arrangement. When such events occur, the transaction price and measurement of progress for the performance obligation are updated and this change is recognized as a cumulative catch-up to revenue. Because of the nature and type of contracts, the timeframe to completion and satisfaction of current and future performance obligations can shift; however, this will have no impact on the Company’s future obligation to bill and collect.As of June 27, 2025, the Company reported $81.8 million in advance payments and unearned revenue and long-term unearned revenue, of which approximately 90% is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter. Approximately $49.3 million and $34.1 million respectively, of revenue was recognized during fiscal 2025 and 2024 that was included in advance payments and unearned revenue at the beginning of each reporting period.Remaining Performance ObligationsWe elect the practical consideration to exclude performance obligations that relate to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less. As our product purchase orders are generally delivered within one year or less and our maintenance and support service contracts can be terminated without substantive termination penalties resulting in contracts with less than one year of duration, these performance obligations have been excluded from the remaining performance obligation amounts. The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to the remaining unsatisfied performance obligations (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $153.5 million at June 27, 2025, relating to our long-term field service projects. Of this amount, we expect to recognize approximately 50% as revenue during fiscal 2026, with the remaining amount to be recognized as revenue beyond 12 months.Note 4. LeasesThe Company leases office space, assembly facilities, repair and service centers, and warehouses globally. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized with initial lease terms greater than one year. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Supplemental lease information is as follows:Fiscal (In thousands)20252024Operating lease cost$1,790 $1,114 Short-term lease cost5,801 3,065 Variable lease cost83 249 Total lease cost$7,674 $4,428 Fiscal(In thousands, except for weighted-average)20252024Weighted-average remaining lease term4.8 years5.7 yearsWeighted-average discount rate5.0 %5.2 %Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities$726 $2,105 Cash paid for operating lease liabilities$1,731 $1,044 68As of June 27, 2025, future minimum lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term greater than one year are as follows (in thousands):2026$1,385 2027646 2028543 2029308 2030190 Thereafter838 Total lease payments3,910 Less: interest(579)Present value of lease liabilities$3,331 Note 5.

Fair Value Measurements of Assets and LiabilitiesFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value and established a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the observable inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:•Level 1 — Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;•Level 2 — Observable market-based inputs or observable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and•Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 71The estimated fair values and valuation input levels of financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 27, 2025, and June 28, 2024, were as follows:Fair Value(In thousands)June 27, 2025June 28, 2024ValuationInputsAssets:Cash and cash equivalents:Money market funds$2,782 $6,602 Level 1Bank certificates of deposit3,660 3,706 Level 2Items are classified within Level 1 if quoted prices are available in active markets. The Company’s Level 1 items are primarily money market funds. As of June 27, 2025, and June 28, 2024, the money market funds were valued at $1.00 net asset value per share.Items are classified within Level 2 if the observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources are available with reasonable levels of price transparency. The Company’s bank certificates of deposit are classified as Level 2. The carrying value of bank certificates of deposit approximates their fair value. The Company did not have any recurring assets or liabilities that were valued using significant unobservable inputs.Note 7. Credit Facility and DebtThe Company entered into a Secured Credit Facility Agreement (the “Credit Facility”), dated May 9, 2023, amended as of November 22, 2023 and October 18, 2024, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing lender and Wells Fargo Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and Regions Capital Markets as lenders. The Credit Facility provides for a $75.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) and a $75.0 million Term Loan Facility (the “Term Loan”) with a maturity date of October 18, 2029. The $75.0 million Revolver can be borrowed with a $10.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit, and a $10.0 million swingline loan sub-limit. On August 28, 2025, the Company entered into an amendment under the Credit Facility to increase the Term Loan and Revolver commitments by $20 million for each instrument. Refer to Note 16. Subsequent Events for further information. In November 2023, the Company borrowed $50.0 million against the Term Loan to primarily settle the cash portion of the consideration associated with the NEC Transaction. Refer to Note 12. Acquisitions for further information. As of June 27, 2025, the available credit under the Revolver was $51.3 million, reflecting the available limit of $60.0 million less outstanding letters of credit of $8.7 million. The Company borrowed $95.0 million and repaid $80.0 million against the Revolver in fiscal 2025. The Company borrowed $75.0 million and repaid $50.6 million against the Term Loan in fiscal 2025. As of June 27, 2025, the Company had $73.1 million outstanding under its Term Loan and $15.0 million borrowings under its Revolver.The following summarizes the Company’s outstanding long-term debt as of June 27, 2025:(In thousands)Term loan$73,125 Revolver15,000 Less: unamortized deferred financing costs(535)Total debt87,590 Less: current portion of long-term debt(18,624)Total long-term debt$68,966 Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at either: (a) Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus the applicable margin; or (b) the Base Rate plus the applicable margin. The pricing levels for interest rate margins are determined based on the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio as determined and adjusted quarterly. As of June 27, 2025, the applicable margin on Adjusted Term SOFR and Base Rate borrowings was 2.75% and 1.75%, respectively. The effective rate of interest on the outstanding Term Loan borrowings as of June 27, 2025, was 6.9%.72The Credit Facility requires the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio to be greater than 1.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of the Company. The Credit Facility also requires that the Company maintain a maximum leverage ratio of 3.00 times EBITDA, with a step-down to 2.75 times EBITDA after four full quarters, and 2.50 times EBITDA after eight full quarters.

Stockholders’ EquityStock Repurchase ProgramIn November 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to $10.0 million of the Company’s common stock. As of June 27, 2025, $6.3 million remained available for repurchase under the November 2021 stock repurchase program. Repurchased shares are recorded as treasury stock and are not formally retired.The following table summarizes the Company’s repurchases of its common stock in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023:Shares PurchasedAverage Price Paid Per ShareAggregate Purchase Amount(In thousands)Fiscal 202539,800 $15.46 $598 Fiscal 202411,208 $29.59 $332 Fiscal 2023— $— $— Stock Incentive ProgramsIn March 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2018 Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”). The 2018 Plan permits the Company to grant share-based awards in the form of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and units (“restricted stock”) and performance share awards and units (“performance shares”) to the Company’s employees and non-employee directors. The 2018 Plan replaced the 2007 Plan as the Company’s primary long-term incentive program. The 2007 Plan was discontinued following stockholder approval of the 2018 Plan, but the outstanding awards under the 2007 Plan will continue to remain in effect in accordance with their terms; provided that, as shares are returned under the 2007 Plan upon cancellation, termination or otherwise of awards outstanding under the 2007 Plan, such shares will be available for grant under the 2018 Plan.Under the 2018 Plan, option exercise prices are equal to the closing market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Options granted to employees vest annually over three years and expire seven years from the date of grant. Restricted stock granted to employees vest annually over three years from the date of grant. Restricted stock granted to non-employee directors vest annually on the day before the annual stockholders’ meeting. Performance shares granted to employees are subject to a three-year cliff vesting period from the date of grant, subject to the achievement of predetermined financial performance and market condition criteria. The vesting of share-based awards granted to the Company’s employees and non-employee directors are generally subject to continued service through the vesting date.New shares of the Company’s common stock are issued to employees upon the exercise of options, vesting of restricted stock, or vesting of performance shares. All awards that are canceled prior to vesting or expire unexercised are returned to the approved pool of reserved shares and made available for future grants under the 2018 Plan. As of June 27, 2025, 414,366 shares remain available for grant under the 2018 Plan.In March 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one right (a “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, to the Company’s stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 3, 2020 (the “Record Date”). Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Preferred Shares”), of the Company at an exercise price of $35.00 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share, subject to adjustment. Until the rights become exercisable, they will not be evidenced by separate certificates and will trade automatically with shares of the Company’s common stock. The Rights have a de minimis fair value. The complete terms of the Rights are set forth in the Amended and Restated Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (the “Plan”), dated as of August 27, 2020, and amended as of February 28, 2023, between the Company and Computershare Inc., as rights agent. By adopting the Plan, the Company is helping to preserve the value of certain deferred tax benefits, including those generated by net operating losses (collectively, the “Tax Benefits”), which could be lost in the event of an “ownership change” as defined under Section 382 of the U.S. tax code. The amended Plan was approved at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in November 2023, which extended the final expiration date of the Plan until March 3, 2026.74In November 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted certain amendments to Aviat’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Charter Amendments”) The Charter Amendments are designed to preserve the Tax Benefits by restricting certain transfers of the Company’s common stock.Share-Based CompensationThe following table presents the compensation expense for share-based awards included in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023:Fiscal Year(In thousands)202520242023By Expense Category:Cost of product sales and services$233 $406 $627 Research and development534 593 514 Selling and administrative6,300 6,342 5,579 Total share-based compensation expense$7,067 $7,341 $6,720 By Type of Award:Options$1,046 $1,549 $1,394 Restricted stock4,636 3,941 3,565 Performance shares1,385 1,851 1,761 Total share-based compensation expense$7,067 $7,341 $6,720 The following table summarizes the unamortized compensation expense and the remaining years over which such expense would be expected to be recognized, on a weighted-average basis, by type of award: June 27, 2025Unamortized ExpenseRemaining Recognition Period(In thousands)(Years)Options$786 0.92Restricted stock4,990 1.59Performance shares2,033 1.74Total$7,809 OptionsA summary of the option activity during fiscal 2025 is as follows:Number of SharesWeighted-AverageExercise PriceWeighted-AverageRemainingContractualTermAggregateIntrinsicValue (In thousands) (Years)(In thousands)Options outstanding as of June 28, 2024437 $27.51 4.64$1,949 Exercised(22)$10.27 Forfeited(23)$33.30 Expired(24)$33.27 Options outstanding as of June 27, 2025368 $27.81 3.37$1,135 Options vested and expected to vest as of June 27, 2025368 $27.81 3.37$1,135 Options exercisable as of June 27, 2025267 $25.76 2.88$1,135 The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value or the aggregate difference between the closing price of the Company’s common stock on June 27, 2025 of $23.94, and the exercise price for in-the-money options that would have been received by the optionees if all options had been exercised on June 27, 2025. 75Additional information related to stock options is summarized below:Fiscal Year(In thousands)202520242023Intrinsic value of options exercised$235 $2,057 $3,725 Fair value of options vested$228 $1,190 $1,142 The fair value of each option grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the date of grant for option grants during fiscal 2024 and 2023.

Note 10. Segment and Geographic InformationAviat operates in one reportable business segment: the design, manufacturing and sale of a range of wireless networking and access networking products, solutions and services. Aviat conducts business globally and its sales and support activities are managed on a geographic basis. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the “CODM”). The CODM manages the business primarily by function globally and reviews financial information on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region, for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The profitability of geographic regions is not a determining factor in allocating resources and the CODM does not evaluate profitability below the level of the consolidated company. Significant segment expenses are presented in Aviat’s consolidated statement of operations.The Company reports revenue by region and country based on the location where customers accept delivery of products and services.

The change in valuation allowance for the fiscal years ended June 27, 2025, and June 28, 2024, was a decrease of $2.0 million and a decrease of $2.6 million, respectively. The decrease in the valuation allowance in fiscal 2025 was primarily due to the release of certain foreign valuation allowances. Similarly the decrease in the valuation allowance in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to the release of certain foreign valuation allowances. As of June 27, 2025, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $1.0 million on certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets that the Company believes is not more likely than not to be realized in future periods.Tax loss and credit carryforwards as of June 27, 2025, have expiration dates ranging between one year and no expiration in certain instances.

Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a benefit to income tax in the year they are generated.80United States income taxes have not been provided on basis differences in foreign subsidiaries of $25.5 million as of June 27, 2025, because of the Company’s intention to reinvest these earnings indefinitely. Additionally, no foreign withholding taxes, federal or state taxes have been provided if these unremitted earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries were distributed, as such amounts are considered permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes, including applicable foreign withholding taxes, that would be due upon the repatriation of these earnings.The Company’s unrecognized tax benefit activity for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:(In thousands)Unrecognized tax benefit as of July 1, 2022$17,707 Additions for tax positions in prior periods19 Additions for tax positions in current periods770 Decreases for tax positions in prior periods— Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations(457)Decreases related to change of foreign exchange rate(1,953)Unrecognized tax benefit as of June 30, 202316,086 Additions for tax positions in prior periods— Additions for tax positions in current periods971 Decreases for tax positions in prior periods— Decrease related to expiration of the statute of limitations(102)Decreases related to change of foreign exchange rate(880)Unrecognized tax benefit as of June 28, 202416,075 Additions for tax positions in prior periods95 Additions for tax positions in current periods723 Decreases for tax positions in prior periods— Decreases related to settlements with tax authorities(186)Decrease related to expiration of the statute of limitations(819)Increases related to change of foreign exchange rate89 Unrecognized tax benefit as of June 27, 2025$15,977 As of June 27, 2025, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $16.0 million for various federal, foreign, and state income tax matters, compared to $16.1 million as of June 28, 2024.

The interest accrued was $0.5 million as of June 27, 2025. An immaterial amount of penalties have been accrued as of June 27, 2025.We file income tax returns in the U.S., Singapore, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination in Singapore for fiscal years 2015-2021 and in various other foreign jurisdictions. We remain subject to potential audits in the U.S. for fiscal years after 2021, and in Singapore for fiscal years after 2014. Additionally, all net operating losses and tax credits generated to date in these two jurisdictions are subject to adjustment. On March 11, 2021, the US enacted the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”) which expands Section 162(m) to cover the next five most highly compensated employees for the taxable year, in addition to the “covered employees” effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026. The Company will continue to examine the elements of the ARPA and the impact it may have on future business.On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) which includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1 billion, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, and a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases by public corporations after December 31, 2022. The Company will continue to evaluate the applicability and effect of the IRA as more guidance is issued.81Note 12. Acquisitions4RF LimitedOn July 2, 2024, the Company acquired 4RF Limited (“4RF”), a New Zealand company, Aviat purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of 4RF in an all-cash transaction for $18.2 million, net of $1.2 million cash acquired. 4RF is a leading provider of industrial wireless access solutions, including narrowband point-to-point/multi-point radios and Private LTE and 5G routers. The acquisition of 4RF allows Aviat to expand its product offering for the global industrial wireless access markets including Private LTE/5G.The 4RF acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company finalized purchase accounting adjustments for the valuation of intangible and tangible assets acquired. The fair value of the acquired intangible assets are based on estimates and assumptions that are considered reasonable to the Company. A summary of the finalized purchase price allocation is as follows:Fair ValueUseful Life in Years(In thousands)Cash and cash equivalents$1,215 Accounts receivable, net2,575 Inventories5,123 Property, plant and equipment, net235 Identifiable finite-lived intangible assets:Customer relationships7,100 10Technology1,800 7Trade names300 3Other assets4,647 Accounts payable(5,104)Advance payments and unearned revenue(323)Other liabilities(2,202)Goodwill3,999 Net assets acquired$19,365 The final purchase price allocation was updated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 for certain measurement period adjustments based on revised estimates of fair value, which primarily resulted in a $1.7 million decrease in inventories, a $1.1 million increase in other assets, a $0.4 million increase in identifiable intangible assets and a $0.3 million increase in goodwill. The goodwill from this acquisition is non-deductible for tax purposes.Revenue and operating income associated with the 4RF acquisition included in the consolidated financial statements of operations from the acquisition date to the period ended June 27, 2025, were $25.3 million and $4.3 million, respectively. NEC’s Wireless Transport BusinessOn May 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Master Sale of Business Agreement (as amended on November 30, 2023, the “Purchase Agreement”) with NEC Corporation (“NEC”) to acquire NEC’s wireless transport business (the “NEC Transaction”). The Company completed the NEC Transaction on November 30, 2023.Prior to the acquisition date, NEC was a leader in wireless backhaul networks with an extensive installed base of their Pasolink series products. The completion of the NEC Transaction increases the scale of Aviat, enhances the Company’s product portfolio with a greater capability to innovate, and creates a more diversified business. The results of operations of the NEC Transaction have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.82The fair value of the consideration transferred at the closing of the NEC Transaction was comprised of (i) cash of $32.2 million, and (ii) the issuance of 736,750 shares or $22.3 million of common stock of the Company. The fair value of the shares issued was determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the acquisition date. Aggregate consideration transferred at closing was approximately $54.5 million, which was subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The Company funded the cash portion of the consideration with Term Loan borrowings under its Credit Facility. Refer to Note 7. Credit Facility and Debt for further information.In the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2025, the Company transferred consideration of $5.8 million and $12.7 million, respectively, to settle the post-closing working capital adjustment. The NEC Transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company is in the process of obtaining final independent third-party valuations of certain intangible and tangible assets acquired. The fair values of the acquired intangible assets are based on estimates and assumptions that are considered reasonable by the Company. As of the acquisition date, the Company has recorded the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their respective estimated fair values. The recognized goodwill is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and expected synergies. The goodwill from this acquisition is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes.Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and are included in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred acquisition-related costs of $8.2 million related to the NEC Transaction during fiscal 2024.A summary of the finalized purchase price allocation is as follows:Fair ValueUseful Life in Years(In thousands)Accounts receivable, net$42,487 Inventories29,279 Property, plant and equipment, net539 Identifiable finite-lived intangible assets:Customer relationships9,200 15Technology3,200 7Other assets243 Accounts payable(13,182)Advance payments and unearned revenue(3,192)Other liabilities(5,597)Goodwill10,543 Net assets acquired$73,520 The final purchase price allocation was updated during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 for certain measurement period adjustments based on revised estimates of fair value. Purchase price allocation adjustments during the measurement period primarily resulted in a $9.4 million decrease in accounts receivable, $6.3 million decrease in inventories, $5.3 million increase in identifiable intangible assets, and $10.0 million increase in goodwill. Revenue and operating loss associated with the NEC Transaction included in the consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date to the period ended June 28, 2024, were $54.9 million and $(1.0) million, respectively.The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information has been presented as if the NEC Transaction had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2023 and includes certain pro forma adjustments for interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, the fair value of acquired inventory, and acquisition-related costs, net of income tax.

(“Redline”), a leading provider of mission-critical data infrastructure, for a purchase price of $20.4 million. Cash acquired as part of the all-cash acquisition was $4.6 million for total net consideration of $15.8 million. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed have been recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The recognized goodwill is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and expected synergies. The goodwill from this acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and are included in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.A summary of the final purchase price allocation is as follows:Fair ValueUseful Life in Years(In thousands)Cash and cash equivalents$4,642 Accounts receivable, net4,281 Inventories3,379 Property, plant and equipment, net688 Identifiable finite-lived intangible assets:Patents690 10Customer relationships7,730 14Trade names1,330 16Other assets1,921 Accounts payable(2,113)Advance payments and unearned revenue(3,301)Other liabilities(3,948)Goodwill5,112 Total consideration$20,411 Note 13. Commitments and ContingenciesPurchase Orders and Other CommitmentsFrom time to time in the normal course of business, the Company may enter into purchasing agreements with its suppliers that require the Company to accept delivery of and remit full payment for (i) finished products that it has ordered, (ii) finished products that it requested be held as safety stock, and (iii) work in process started on its behalf, in the event it cancels or terminates the purchasing agreement. Because these agreements do not specify fixed or minimum quantities, do not specify minimum or variable price provisions, and do not specify the approximate timing of the transaction, and the Company has no present intention to cancel or terminate any of these agreements, the Company currently does not believe that it has any future liability under these agreements.As of June 27, 2025, the Company had outstanding purchase obligations with its suppliers or contract manufacturers of approximately $48.1 million. In addition, the Company had purchase obligations of approximately $4.9 million associated with software as a service and software maintenance support.84Financial Guarantees and Commercial CommitmentsGuarantees issued by banks, insurance companies, or other financial institutions are contingent commitments issued to guarantee performance under borrowing arrangements, such as bank overdraft facilities, tax and customs obligations, and similar transactions, or to ensure performance under customer or vendor contracts. The terms of the guarantees are generally equal to the remaining term of the related debt or other obligations and are generally limited to two years or less. As of June 27, 2025, the Company had no guarantees applicable to its debt arrangements.The Company has entered into commercial commitments in the normal course of business including surety bonds, standby letters of credit agreements, and other arrangements with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts to provide products and services to customers. As of June 27, 2025, the Company had commercial commitments outstanding of $31.0 million, that were not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any significant amounts will be required to be paid on these performance guarantees in the future.The following table presents details of the Company’s commercial commitments:(In thousands)June 27, 2025Letters of credit$8,693 Bonds22,325 Total commercial commitments$31,018 IndemnificationsUnder the terms of substantially all of the Company’s license agreements, it has agreed to defend and pay any final judgment against its customers arising from claims against such customers that the Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. As of June 27, 2025, the Company has not received any notice that any customer is subject to an infringement claim arising from the use of its products; the Company has not received any request to defend any customers from infringement claims arising from the use of its products; and the Company has not paid any final judgment on behalf of any customer related to an infringement claim arising from the use of its products. Because the outcome of infringement disputes is related to the specific facts of each case and given the lack of previous or current indemnification claims, the Company cannot estimate the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, related to its indemnification provisions. As of June 27, 2025, the Company had not recorded any liabilities related to these indemnifications.Legal ProceedingsThe Company is subject from time to time to disputes with customers concerning its products and services. From time to time, the Company may be involved in various other legal claims and litigation that arise in the normal course of its operations. The Company is aggressively defending all current litigation matters. Although there can be no assurances and the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, the Company currently believes that none of these claims or proceedings are likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other third-party claims against the Company may cause it to incur costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges. As a result, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from the Company’s estimates, if any.The Company records accruals for its outstanding legal proceedings, investigations or claims when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates, at least on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings, investigations or claims that could affect the amount of any accrual, as well as any developments that would result in a loss contingency to become both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company has not recorded any significant accrual for loss contingencies associated with such legal claims or litigation discussed above.85Contingent LiabilitiesThe Company records a loss contingency as a charge to operations when (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements; and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure in the notes to the financial statements is required for loss contingencies that do not meet both conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred. Gain contingencies are not recorded until realized. The Company expenses all legal costs incurred to resolve regulatory, legal and tax matters as incurred.In March 2016, an enforcement action by the Indian Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance was brought against Aviat’s subsidiary Aviat Networks (India) Private Limited (“Aviat India”) relating to the non-realization of intercompany receivables and non-payment of intercompany payables, which originated from 1999 to 2012, within the time frames dictated by the Indian regulations under the Foreign Exchange Management Act. In November 2017, the Indian Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance also initiated a similar action against Telsima Communications Private Limited (“Telsima India”), a subsidiary of the Company, relating to the non-realization of intercompany receivables and non-payment of intercompany payables which originated from the period prior to our acquisition of Telsima India in February 2009. In September 2019, the directors of Aviat India appeared before the Ministry of Finance Enforcement Directorate. In March 2024, the Company appeared before the Joint Director of Enforcement to review the transactions at issue. The Company appeared with their attorneys at a hearing on May 22, 2025, to once again provide information. No subsequent hearing date has been scheduled as of September 10, 2025. The Company has accrued an immaterial amount representing the estimated probable loss for which it would settle the matter. The Company currently cannot form an estimate of the range of loss in excess of its amounts already accrued. If the outcome of this matter is greater than the current immaterial amount accrued, the Company intends to dispute it vigorously.Periodically, the Company reviews the status of each significant matter to assess the potential financial exposure. If a potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss is reflected in our results of operations. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and whether such loss is reasonably estimable. Further, estimates of this nature are highly subjective, and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the consolidated financial statements.As additional information becomes available, the Company will reassess the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise estimates accordingly. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial position.Note 14.

Related Party TransactionsNEC CorporationOn November 30, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed the NEC Transaction. Refer to Note 12. Acquisitions for further information. A portion of the total consideration in the NEC Transaction included the issuance of 736,750 shares in Company common stock to NEC. The Company and NEC entered into a Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement, restricting NEC’s ability to transfer shares (the “Lock-Up”), except for certain limited exceptions as provided in the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement, until one day after the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the “Initial Lock-Up Expiration Date”). Starting one day after the Initial Lock-Up Expiration Date, one-twelfth of the issued shares shall be released from the Lock-Up each month, such that all issued shares shall be released from Lock-Up by the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, NEC will have the right to nominate a director to the Company’s Board of Directors from the Closing Date and for a period of two years thereafter. As of June 27, 2025, NEC held approximately 5.8% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.In connection with the closing of the NEC Transaction and as of the Closing Date, the Company and NEC entered into agreements covering the performance of certain post-closing services and licensing arrangements. The agreements include arrangements covering manufacturing services and product supply, transition services, distribution services, research and development services, and licensing of trademark and intellectual property (“IP”).The Manufacturing and Supply Agreement includes arrangements for NEC to manufacture and supply Pasolink products on behalf of and to the Company and its customers. The transition services agreements include arrangements for the Company and NEC to provide and receive certain transition services, primarily associated with administrative functions. The distribution services agreements include arrangements where NEC will provide distribution services on behalf of and to the Company and its customers in certain international markets and territories. The Research and Development Cooperating Agreement for Existing Products includes arrangements for NEC to provide the Company certain services relating to development work to maintain existing products of the NEC business. The licensing agreements include arrangements where the Company will grant NEC a non-exclusive license to certain Pasolink trademarks in Japan, and NEC will grant the Company a non-exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan) license to certain NEC IP, including mobile backhaul-related patents. The licensing agreements are royalty-free and perpetual.A summary of the related party activity between the Company and NEC is as follows:(In thousands)June 27, 2025June 28, 2024Transition services received$3,292 4,472 Research and development services received5,401 7,222 Purchase of inventories38,285 10,853 87The Company’s outstanding related party balances with NEC included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:(In thousands)June 27, 2025June 28, 2024Accounts receivable, net$8,223 638 Other current assets— 400 Accounts payable41,670 17,182 Other current liabilities— 19,896 Note 16. Subsequent EventsOn August 13, 2025, NEC issued a letter of arbitration to the Company demanding $19 million of additional component purchases, which the Company believes is unfounded and not required under the Manufacturing Supply Agreement (“MSA”). The NEC arbitration also included a demand for payment of the outstanding accounts payable balances which are reflected in Accounts payable of the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and disclosed in Note. 15 Related Party Transactions. As of June 27, 2025, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters. As such, no loss accrual is deemed necessary as of June 27, 2025. The Company will continue to evaluate the proceedings and the expected outcome of this matter. On August 28, 2025, the Company entered into an amendment for the Credit Facility. The amendment provided for changes and modifications to the Credit Facility, which include an increase in the Term Loan commitments by $20 million in the aggregate and an increase in the Revolver commitment by $20 million in the aggregate. 88Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNot applicable.Item 9A. Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of June 27, 2025, an evaluation was performed, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO concluded that as of June 27, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below.Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described, management concluded the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2025. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO framework).The Company completed the acquisition of 4RF Limited in July 2024, and management has excluded the acquired business’s internal control over financial reporting from its assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls as of the fiscal year ended June 27, 2025. The acquired business represents approximately 6% of consolidated total revenues for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2025.Based on its assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 27, 2025, due to the material weaknesses detailed below.A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that a reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.Management determined that the Company had the following material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2025:Ineffective control environment and control activities: the Company did not maintain an effective control environment and control activities based on the criteria established in the COSO framework. The Company did not have sufficient resources with the appropriate levels of knowledge, experience, and training in accounting and internal control over financial reporting. Control activities were either not designed effectively or operating effectively for a sufficient period of time to support the operating effectiveness of the controls to prevent and detect potential material errors. As a result, the following control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses: ineffective controls over (a) the review of reconciliations for revenue related account balances, (b) certain arrangements where revenue is recognized over time, and (c) the determination of the appropriate period for revenue recognition. 89Remediation PlanBeginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 we initiated and will continue to implement measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate these material weaknesses with oversight from the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, including the following:•We have hired, and will continue to hire, qualified professionals to strengthen the design, implementation and execution of internal controls, across all functions and personnel departments.•We will continue to provide enhanced training to relevant control owners emphasizing the importance of timely and proper execution of their assigned control activities.•We will continue to strengthen controls over more complex revenue arrangements, including those recognized over time and associated account reconciliations.•We will augment & extend our use of system and process improvements to reduce reliance on manual controls.We are committed to continuing our efforts to build and maintain a strong control environment and believe that these remediation efforts represent an incremental evolution of and improvements to our control environment. Though we made significant progress during fiscal 2025, the material weaknesses won't be considered fully remediated until the associated controls operate effectively for a sufficient period of time.The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2025, has been audited by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report included herein.Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial ReportingThe Company is in the process of implementing internal control procedures related to the acquired business and expects this to be completed during fiscal 2026.Except as noted in the foregoing sentence and as set forth above in connection with our material weaknesses, there were no other changes to internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) that occurred during the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsThe Company’s management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.90Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Aviat Networks, Inc.Opinion on Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Aviat Networks, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 27, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses identified below on the achievement of objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2025, of the Company and our report dated September 10, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of the 4RF acquisition, which was acquired on July 2, 2024, and whose financial statements constitute approximately 6% of total revenue of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2025. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting for the 4RF acquisition. Basis for OpinionThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.91Material WeaknessesA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management’s assessment: The Company did not maintain an effective control environment and control activities based on the criteria established in the COSO framework. The Company did not have sufficient resources with the appropriate levels of knowledge, experience, and training in accounting and internal control over financial reporting. Control activities were either not designed effectively or operating effectively for a sufficient period of time to support the operating effectiveness of the controls to prevent and detect potential material errors. As a result, the following control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses: ineffective controls over (a) the review of reconciliations for revenue related account balances, (b) certain arrangements where revenue is recognized over time, and (c) the determination of the appropriate period for revenue recognition.These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2025, of the Company, and this report does not affect our report on such financial statements./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPAustin, TexasSeptember 10, 202592Item 9B. Other InformationDuring the three months ended June 27, 2025, none of the Company’s Directors or Officers adopted, modified or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or a “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent InspectionsNot applicable.93PART IIICertain information required by Part III is omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K because the Company will file a definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year ended June 27, 2025.Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate GovernanceThe Company adopted a Code of Conduct that is available at www.aviatnetworks.com.
