This Amendment is being filed for the purpose of including the information required by Items 10 through 14 of Part III of Form 10-K not included in the Original Report. This information required by Items 10 through 14 of Part III of Form 10-K was previously omitted from the Original Report in reliance on the SEC’s general instructions to Form 10-K, which permit the information in the above referenced items to be incorporated by reference from a definitive proxy statement if such statement is filed no later than 120 days after a company’s fiscal year-end. The Company is filing this Amendment to include the Part III information in the Original Report because the Company’s definitive proxy statement containing this information will not be filed before such date. As such, this Amendment hereby amends and supplements Items 10 through 14 of Part III of the Original Report and amends and updates the Form 10-K cover page (primarily to update the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock outstanding to July 17, 2025). In addition, in accordance with applicable SEC rules, Item 15 of Part IV of the Original Report has been supplemented to include currently dated certifications pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Except as described above, this Amendment does not amend, update, or change any other items or disclosures in the Original Report and does not purport to reflect any information or events subsequent to the filing of the Original Report, including, without limitation, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, by and among the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, and TTAM Research Institute, dated as of June 13, 2025. As such, this Amendment speaks only as of the date the Original Report was filed, and the Company has not undertaken herein to amend, supplement, or update any information contained in the Original Report to give effect to any subsequent events. KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) issued reports on the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, within the Original Report. As this Amendment speaks to the date of the Original Report, KPMG’s reports speak only as to June 11, 2025. The Company has made no substantive changes to the Original Report other than those noted above.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES  Philosophy and Key Objectives of the Compensation Program We design our executive compensation program to (i) allow us to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers, and (ii) allow these executive officers the opportunity to own a portion of the Company. We believe that our ability to ensure that our executive officers are engaged and productive depends upon how we structure our compensation program. In addition, for us to be appropriately positioned to attract new talent, we must be prepared to be, and be perceived as, an employer that offers competitive compensation. We believe that providing our executive officers an opportunity to be partial owners in our business fosters their active engagement in our success, strengthens our retention objectives, and aligns their long-term interests with those of our stockholders. Consistent with this philosophy, we have designed our executive compensation program to achieve the following primary objectives:
•
attract and retain highly qualified, experienced executive officers who can make significant contributions to our long-term business success;
•
reward executive officers for achieving business goals and delivering strong performance; and
•
align executive incentives with stockholder value creation. DETERMINATION OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  The Compensation Committee is charged with the responsibility of determining and administering the Company’s executive compensation program, as discussed below. Role of the Compensation Committee Our Board has delegated authority to the Compensation Committee to oversee and approve the overall compensation program for our executive officers. In making its decisions, the Compensation Committee takes into consideration a variety of factors, including the recommendations of management and the independent compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee has the authority to exercise discretion with respect to executive compensation awards and performance metrics and may authorize adjustments to targets and/or awards as it deems necessary or appropriate. Role of Executive Officers Our former CEO, Ms. Wojcicki, provided input and made recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding our Fiscal 2025 executive compensation program. During Fiscal 2025, she also reported to the Compensation Committee on individual NEO performance and provided recommendations regarding each NEO’s compensation (except with respect to her own compensation). Role of Compensation Consultant As provided in its charter, the Compensation Committee has the sole authority to hire, terminate, and approve fees for compensation consultants, outside legal counsel, and other advisors as it deems necessary to assist in the fulfillment of its responsibilities. The Compensation Committee retained Compensia, Inc. (“Compensia”), a  6 Table of Contentsmanagement consulting firm, as its independent compensation consultant for Fiscal 2025. Compensia provides research, market data, survey, proxy information, and design expertise in developing executive and director compensation programs. As requested by the Compensation Committee, Compensia provided the Compensation Committee with market data from proprietary surveys and databases and publicly available information to consider when making compensation decisions for the NEOs. The Compensation Committee reviewed its relationship with Compensia and determined that there are no conflicts of interest pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. Compensia did not provide any additional services unrelated to executive or director or broader equity strategy compensation consulting to the Company in Fiscal 2025. Compensation Benchmarking and Setting Executive Compensation Generally, the Compensation Committee targets NEO pay within the peer market range, subject to adjustment based on the Compensation Committee’s assessment of the Company’s and the NEO’s performance. The Compensation Committee evaluated the actual pay of the NEOs with pay data drawn from publicly-disclosed pay information for the following publicly traded companies, which comprised the Fiscal 2025 Peer Group:

In general, we seek to provide a base salary level designed to reflect each NEO’s position and scope of responsibility and accountability. In light of her equity interests in the Company, Ms. Wojcicki historically has received base salary compensation significantly lower than that of the other NEOs. Base salaries in effect during Fiscal 2025 are shown in the table below:

(1)  Effective May 21, 2024, Mr. Selsavage’s annual base salary was increased from $530,000 to $600,000 to reflect his change from interim Chief Financial Officer to permanent Chief Financial Officer (the “Selsavage Base Salary Increase”).
(2)  Mr. Kvarda does not receive compensation directly from the Company; the terms of his service as Chief Restructuring Officer are pursuant to the A&M Engagement Letter (as defined below).
(3)  Ms. Wojcicki’s annual base salary was provided to comply with applicable California minimum salary laws. 7 Table of ContentsANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS  Joseph Selsavage, William Richards, and Kathy Hibbs were each eligible to participate in the Fiscal 2025 Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP”), pursuant to which they were each eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus based upon the Company’s achievement of certain pre-established financial performance metrics during the one-year performance period ended March 31, 2025 (the “Fiscal 2025 performance period”). Mr. Selsavage’s, Mr. Richards’s, and Ms. Hibbs’s AIP target bonus opportunities were each equal to 30% of their respective base salaries. Additionally, for Mr. Selsavage, his AIP target bonus opportunity was prorated to reflect the Selsavage Base Salary Increase. As Mr. Richards and Ms. Hibbs ceased to be employed by the Company in August 2024 and May 2024, respectively, they were not entitled to receive any payouts pursuant to the AIP for the Fiscal 2025 performance period. Accordingly, Mr. Selsavage was the only NEO entitled to receive an AIP payout for the Fiscal 2025 performance period. The Compensation Committee determined that Gross Margin (as measured by revenue after cost of sales) and Adjusted EBIDTA should be the performance metrics for the Fiscal 2025 performance period, with Gross Margin weighted 75% and Adjusted EBITDA weighted 25%. The following sets forth the Company’s actual performance and percent achievement based on performance of the Fiscal 2025 AIP performance metrics. While the Company’s actual performance would have resulted in a payout achievement of 25%, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion and determined that no payouts pursuant to the AIP should be made to any participating NEO for the Fiscal 2025 performance period. Accordingly, Mr. Selsavage did not receive a payout under the Fiscal 2025 AIP.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest income (expense), net other income (expense), income tax expenses (benefit), depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, stock-based compensation expense, and other items that are considered unusual or not representative of underlying trends of our business, including, but not limited to: changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, litigation settlements, gains or losses on dispositions of subsidiaries, acquisition transaction-related costs, and cybersecurity incident expenses, net of probable insurance recoveries, if applicable for the periods presented.LONG-TERM EQUITY  The only long-term equity award granted to a NEO in Fiscal 2025 was a grant of 50,000 restricted stock units (“RSUs”) (as adjusted to reflect the one-for-20 reverse stock split effected on October 16, 2024) to Joseph Selsavage on May 25, 2024 (the “Selsavage Equity Award”). The Selsavage Equity Award vests equally in 1/8 quarterly installments commencing on August 20, 2024.  8 Table of ContentsBENEFITS  As employees of the Company, the NEOs are eligible to participate in all the broad-based Company-sponsored benefits programs on the same basis as other full-time employees. The Company’s health and welfare plans include medical, dental and vision benefits, commuter benefits, flexible-spending accounts, paid family leave to supplement the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, back-up child and elder care, personal legal resources (for estate planning, for instance), an enhanced employee assistance program (EAP) with up to eight complimentary therapy visits, personal financial wellness platform and access to fiduciary advisors, parental leave, short-term and long-term disability insurance, and life insurance. Additionally, we offer a tax-qualified retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Retirement and Savings Plan (the “401(k) plan”), which provides eligible employees, including the NEOs, with an opportunity to save for retirement on a tax-advantaged basis. All participants’ interests in their contributions are 100% vested when contributed. Under the 401(k) plan, the Company can make discretionary matching contributions, and it currently provides a dollar-for-dollar match up to a maximum of 2% of the eligible employees’ base pay per pay period. New hires are automatically enrolled at a 6% contribution rate. The 401(k) plan is intended to qualify under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code. Executive officers do not accrue vacation, as they are able to use unlimited vacation. We otherwise do not offer preferential benefits or perquisites to our executive officers that are not widely available to all full-time employees. EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH NEOS  Employment arrangements with the NEOs are set forth below. Joseph Selsavage On March 21, 2025 (the “Retention Agreement Effective Date”), the Company entered into a Cash Retention Agreement (the “Retention Agreement”) with Mr. Selsavage. Pursuant to the Retention Agreement, the Company paid Mr. Selsavage a cash bonus of $500,000 on the Retention Agreement Effective Date (the “Retention Bonus”) as consideration for his continued service during the period beginning on the Retention Agreement Effective Date and ending on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2025 and (ii) the date of the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy following the effective date of a plan of reorganization approved by the Court and implemented under the Bankruptcy Code or a consummation of a comprehensive out-of-court restructuring transaction, in either case, involving the Company and/or its affiliates (the “Retention Period”). In the event that Mr. Selsavage’s employment with the Company is terminated prior to the end of the Retention Period due to (i) Mr. Selsavage’s resignation for any reason other than Good Reason, or (ii) by the Company for Cause (each as defined in the Retention Agreement), Mr. Selsavage will be required to repay to the Company, within forty-five (45) days following the date of his employment termination, the entire gross amount of the Retention Bonus (the “Retention Bonus Clawback”). The Retention Bonus Clawback will not apply if Mr. Selsavage’s employment is terminated during the Retention Period due to (x) his death or disability, (y) a termination by the Company without Cause, or (z) a resignation by Mr. Selsavage for Good Reason. The Retention Agreement does not modify any existing employment, severance, or other agreement between the Company and Mr. Selsavage. Matt Kvarda In January 2025, the Company authorized the employment of Alvarez & Marsal North America, LLC (“A&M”) as the Company’s financial advisor. On March 21, 2025, the Board appointed Matthew Kvarda to serve as Chief Restructuring Officer (“CRO”) of the Company, which such appointment was subject to the filing of the bankruptcy petitions and effective upon March 23, 2025 (the “Bankruptcy Petitions Date”). In connection with Mr. Kvarda’s appointment, the Company entered into that certain Engagement Letter (the “A&M Engagement Letter”) with A&M, to set forth the terms of A&M’s engagement and Mr. Kvarda’s service as the Company’s CRO. As further set forth in the A&M Engagement Letter, Mr. Kvarda’s authority as CRO includes, in connection with the Company’s advisors and management, (a) performing a financial review of the Company, (b) assisting in the identification (and implementation) of cost reduction and operations improvement opportunities, (c) assisting with the Special  9 Table of ContentsCommittee’s review of possible restructuring plans or strategic alternatives, (d) serving as the principal contact with the Company’s creditors with respect to financial and operational matters, and (e) upon the mutual agreement of A&M and the Company, providing additional A&M employees to assist the CRO in the execution of his duties. Under the A&M Engagement Letter, the Company is required to pay A&M $1,300 per hour of service provided by Mr. Kvarda. The A&M Engagement Letter also provides for hourly fees should additional A&M personnel assist Mr. Kvarda in executing his duties as CRO. In addition to the aforementioned hourly compensation, A&M is entitled to $750,000.00 in incentive compensation payable upon the earlier of (x) the consummation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and (y) the sale, transfer, or other disposition of all or a substantial portion of the assets or equity of the Company. No fees were earned by Mr. Kvarda or paid by the Company pursuant to the A&M Engagement Letter in connection with services rendered by Mr. Kvarda during the period beginning on the Bankruptcy Petitions Date and ending March 31, 2025. Anne Wojcicki Ms. Wojcicki did not have an employment agreement during her tenure as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. William Richards On February 20, 2020, 23andMe, Inc. entered into an offer letter with Mr. Richards to serve as its Director, Target and Drug Discovery (the “Richards Offer Letter”). The Richards Offer Letter initially provided for an annual base salary of $325,000. In connection with the commencement of his employment, Mr. Richards also received an option to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock, which vested 25% after 12 months of service and on a pro rata basis (in remaining 1/48 installments) over the following 36 months of service. Mr. Richards also is eligible to participate in the benefit plans that are generally available to all employees. Kathy Hibbs On February 6, 2014, 23andMe, Inc. entered into an offer letter with Ms. Hibbs to serve as its Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer (the “Hibbs Offer Letter”). The Hibbs Offer Letter initially provided for an annual base salary of $400,000, subject to adjustment from time to time. In connection with the commencement of her employment, Ms. Hibbs also received an option to purchase 525,000 shares of common stock, which vested 25% after 12 months of service and on a pro rata basis (in remaining 1/48 installments) over the following 36 months of service. Ms. Hibbs also is eligible to participate in the benefit plans that are generally available to all employees. The Hibbs Offer Letter also included an annual performance bonus of up to 30% of Ms. Hibbs’ base salary rate based upon the achievement of objective and subjective criteria established by Ms. Wojcicki and approved by the Board; we discontinued the bonus program in February 2018. The Hibbs Offer Letter provides for certain severance benefits. If Ms. Hibbs experiences an involuntary separation from service by the Company for any reason other than Cause, death, or Permanent Disability (each as defined in the Hibbs Offer Letter), then she will receive four months of continued salary at the rate that was in effect at the time of the termination. The receipt of any severance benefits is subject to Ms. Hibbs’ execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims. Additionally, the Hibbs Offer Letter also provided for certain change-in-control benefits; however, in December 2022, the Separation Benefits (as defined below) provided for pursuant to the CIC Plan (as defined below) superseded and replaced any and all change-in-control benefits provided for in the Hibbs Offer Letter. In connection with Ms. Hibbs’ retirement, on May 23, 2024, the Company entered into the that certain Consulting Agreement and Statement of Work #1 thereunder, dated as of May 24, 2024 (together, the “Hibbs Consulting Agreement”). Pursuant to the Hibbs Consulting Agreement, Ms. Hibbs provided general advisory services to the Company to support the transition of legal and regulatory related work (the “Advisory Services”). During the Consulting Term (as defined below) of the Hibbs Consulting Agreement, Ms. Hibbs was anticipated to provide a maximum of ten hours of Advisory Services to the Company a month and was compensated at an hourly rate of $750 (rounded to the nearest quarter hour as billed). Additionally, Ms. Hibbs was entitled to reimbursement for out-of-pocket and reasonable expenses, provided that such expenses were pre-approved by the Company.  10 Table of ContentsThe Hibbs Consulting Agreement clarified that equity awards that were previously granted to Ms. Hibbs in connection with her prior employment with the Company that remained outstanding and unvested as of May 24, 2024 did not continue to vest as a result of Ms. Hibbs’ and the Company’s entry into the Hibbs Consulting Agreement or Ms. Hibbs’ status as a consultant of the Company. The Hibbs Consulting Agreement contains customary provisions and restrictive covenants, including provisions related to proprietary information, intellectual property, confidentiality, and non-solicitation. The Hibbs Consulting Agreement was effective as of May 28, 2024 and remained in effect until May 30, 2025 (the “Consulting Term”). CLAWBACK  In October 2022, the SEC adopted Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which required national securities exchanges, including Nasdaq, to establish listing standards relating to executive officer incentive compensation clawback and disclosure rules. Nasdaq established listing standards in accordance with Rule 10D-1 (the “Nasdaq Clawback Listing Standards”), which took effect on October 2, 2023 and required listed companies to adopt a compliant clawback policy no later than December 1, 2023. Accordingly, on November 14, 2023, the Compensation Committee adopted the 23andMe Holding Co. Compensation Recoupment Policy (the “Clawback Policy”). The Clawback Policy (i) provides for the mandatory recoupment of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation in the event of an accounting restatement in accordance with the Nasdaq Clawback Listing Standards and (ii) provides the Compensation Committee with the discretionary authority to recoup certain compensation in the event the Compensation Committee determines that a “Senior Officer” has engaged in any of the following: (a) material failure to comply with the policies and procedures of the Company; (b) commission of any felony, willful misconduct, or breach of a fiduciary duty, in each case, in connection with such Senior Officer’s services to the Company; (c) commission of an act of gross misconduct, fraud, embezzlement, or misappropriation with respect to the Company; or (d) breach of any restrictive covenant to which such Senior Officer is subject under any employment agreement or applicable policy of the Company. Under the Clawback Policy, a “Senior Officer” means any person designated by the Board as an “officer” in accordance with Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Additionally, pursuant to the 23andMe Holding Co. Second Amended and Restated 2021 Incentive Equity Plan (the “2021 Plan”), subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Compensation Committee may provide in any grant instrument that, if a participant breaches any restrictive covenant agreement between the participant and the Company or otherwise engages in activities that constitute Cause (as defined in the 2021 Plan) either while employed by, or providing service to, the Company or within a specified period of time thereafter, all grants held by the participant shall terminate, and the Company may rescind any exercise of an option or stock appreciation right (“SAR”) and the vesting of any other grant and delivery of shares upon such exercise or vesting (including pursuant to dividends and dividend equivalents), as applicable on such terms as the Compensation Committee shall determine, including the right to require that, in the event of any such rescission, (i) the participant shall return to the Company the shares received upon the exercise of any option or SAR and/or the vesting and payment of any other grant (including pursuant to dividends and dividend equivalents), or, (ii) if the participant no longer owns the shares, the participant shall pay to the Company the amount of any gain realized or payment received as a result of any sale or other disposition of the shares (or, in the event the participant transfers the shares by gift or otherwise without consideration, the fair market value of the shares on the date of the breach of the restrictive covenant agreement (including a participant’s grant instrument containing restrictive covenants) or activity constituting Cause), net of the price originally paid by the participant for the shares. Payment by the participant shall be made in such manner and on such terms and conditions as may be required by the Compensation Committee. The Company shall be entitled to set off against the amount of any such payment any amounts otherwise owed to the participant by the Company. In addition, all grants under the 2021 Plan are subject to any applicable clawback or recoupment policies, share trading policies, and other policies that may be implemented by the Board from time to time. TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF COMPENSATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 162(M)  Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows a tax deduction to publicly held companies (such as the Company) for compensation paid to certain “covered employees” in excess of $1,000,000 per covered employee in any year.  11 Table of ContentsNeither the Compensation Committee nor the full Board has adopted a formal policy regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid to the Company’s executive officers. While the Compensation Committee carefully considers the net cost and value to the Company of maintaining the deductibility of all compensation, it also desires the flexibility to reward the Company’s executive officers in a manner that enhances the Company’s ability to attract and retain individuals as well as to create longer-term value for our stockholders. Thus, income tax deductibility is only one of several factors the Compensation Committee considers in making decisions regarding the Company’s executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee may authorize compensation that might not be deductible if the Compensation Committee determines that such compensation decision is in the best interest of the Company. Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of 23andMe Holding Co. (the “Company”) has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (the “CD&A”) included in this Amendment with members of management, and based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the CD&A be included in this Amendment. This report has been furnished by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Mark Jensen (Chair) Jim Frankola Andre Fernandez The foregoing Compensation Committee Report does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates the report by reference therein. Compensation Risk Management and Other Policies COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT Our Compensation Committee is responsible for the oversight of our compensation risk profile. The Compensation Committee reviews our compensation approach outlined above to ensure that the policies, plan documents, and practices do not encourage excessive risk-taking. The assessment reviews our best practices and ensures that:
•
Pay levels are competitive with the relevant market for talent and aligned with the Company’s performance relative to peers.
•
The executive compensation program has the appropriate balance of fixed versus variable pay and short-term versus long- term focus.
•
Our compensation programs include features that discourage excessive risk-taking.
•
The Compensation Committee approves all matters related to executive compensation, is supported by an independent advisor, and has the authority to make modifications or adjustments. Based on the assessment, the Compensation Committee believes that the Company’s compensation programs are balanced and do not create risks reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company. Accordingly, there were no material adjustments made to our compensation policies and practices. We will continue to monitor our compensation policies and practices to determine whether our risk management objectives are being met with respect to incentivizing the Company’s executive officers.  12 Table of ContentsPOLICIES PROHIBITING HEDGING, PLEDGING, AND SPECULATIVE OR SHORT-TERM TRADING The 23andMe Holding Co. Amended and Restated Insider Trading Policy (the “Insider Trading Policy”) prohibits employees (including executive officers), directors, advisors, and consultants of the Company (collectively, “Team Members”) from purchasing financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds), or otherwise engaging in transactions that hedge, offset, or are designed to hedge or offset, any decrease in the market value or the full ownership risks and rewards of a Team Member’s holdings in Company securities. The Insider Trading Policy also prohibits executive officers and directors from directly or indirectly pledging, hypothecating, or otherwise encumbering shares of the Company’s stock as collateral for indebtedness. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, holding such shares in a margin account or any other account that could cause the Company’s stock to be subject to a margin call or otherwise be available as collateral for a margin loan. Additionally, this prohibition applies to the Company’s stock that (i) an executive officer or director owns directly or indirectly or (ii) is granted by the Company as part of an executive officer’s or director’s compensation. The Insider Trading Policy also prohibits Team Members from engaging in short sales (sales of securities that are not currently owned by the seller), transactions in put or call options, margin trading, or other inherently speculative transactions with respect to Company securities at any time. GRANT PRACTICES SPECIFIC TO STOCK OPTION AWARDS Although we do not have a formal policy regarding the timing of stock option grants to our NEOs coinciding with the release of material nonpublic information, we do not time the release of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of any NEO award. Additionally, our NEOs do not choose the grant date for their individual stock option grants; instead, the grant date generally ties to date of the meeting during which the Compensation Committee approves such NEO award. During Fiscal 2025, none of our NEOs were awarded stock options.

Amounts represent the Fiscal 2025 AIP. Target amounts represent 100% achievement of the Fiscal 2025 performance metrics, and maximum amounts represent 125% achievement of the Fiscal 2025 performance metrics. Each of Mr. Selsavage, Mr. Richards, and Ms. Hibbs were eligible to participate in the Fiscal 2025 AIP; however, as Mr. Richards and Ms. Hibbs ceased to be employed by the Company in August 2024 and May 2024, respectively, they were not entitled to receive any payouts pursuant to the AIP for the Fiscal 2025 performance period. Additionally, the Compensation Committee determined that no participating NEO would receive a Fiscal 2025 AIP payout.

Amounts represent the number of shares and related value for stock awards that vested on applicable vesting dates, prior to the withholding of shares to satisfy taxes. Consistent with Company policy, upon the vesting of these awards, the Company withheld a portion of the otherwise distributable shares in respect of taxes. Accordingly, after shares were withheld for taxes, the NEOs acquired the following net share amounts: Mr. Selsavage — 21,183; Ms. Wojcicki — 15,632 (paid tax via cash); Mr. Richards — 9,521; and Ms. Hibbs — 3,180.

The amounts shown in the Value Realized on Vesting column are calculated based on the closing market price of the stock on the date when the RSUs vested. POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE OF CONTROL Change of Control Under the CIC Plan On December 5, 2022, the Board approved the adoption of the 23andMe Holding Co. Change in Control Separation Plan (the “CIC Plan”) to be effective as of December 5, 2022. Pursuant to the CIC Plan, the Company’s “Officers” (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act), including the NEOs, and certain key employees (each, a “Participant” and collectively, the “Participants”) designated by the Board, the Compensation Committee, or, with respect to employees who are not Officers, the Chief Executive Officer, will be entitled to receive certain separation benefits if such Participant’s employment is terminated in connection with a Change in Control (as defined in the CIC Plan). Specifically, a Participant will be entitled to the Separation Benefits (as defined below) if (i) a Change in Control occurs and, (ii) within the period beginning 30 days before and ending 12 months after such Change in Control, such Participant’s employment is terminated either (a) by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company without Cause (as defined in the CIC Plan) or (b) by such Participant for Good Reason (as defined in the CIC Plan) (the occurrence of (i) and (ii), a “Double-Trigger Event”). Subject to a Participant’s execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company, a Participant will be entitled to the following separation benefits (collectively, the “Separation Benefits”) upon the occurrence of a Double-Trigger Event:
•
a lump-sum cash payment equal to six months of the Participant’s annual base salary (either in effect on the date of termination or in effect on the date of the Change in Control, whichever is higher) plus one-half of the Participant’s target annual bonus under the Company’s AIP for the year of termination;
•
a lump-sum cash payment equal to the cost of six months of COBRA continuation of the medical, dental, and vision coverage in effect for the Participant on the date of termination; and
•
the acceleration of all of the Participant’s outstanding unvested equity awards granted under the 2021 Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Separation Benefits will be reduced by any separation payments or benefits received by the Participant under any offer letter, employment agreement, or contract with the Company or its subsidiaries or any payments required by applicable law as a result of the termination of the Participant’s employment. The Separation Benefits may also be subject to adjustment if any Separation Benefits constitute an “excess parachute payment” under the Code. The Separation Benefits will not affect any other accrued or vested or earned but deferred compensation rights or other benefits that may be owed to a Participant following the termination, including, but not limited to, accrued vacation or sick-pay amounts or benefits payable under any bonus or other compensation plan, stock purchase plan, life insurance plan, health plan, disability plan, or similar or successor plan.   16 Table of ContentsThe CIC Plan may be terminated or amended by the Board until a Change in Control has occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the CIC Plan may not be amended or terminated. The Separation Benefits provided for pursuant to the CIC Plan superseded and replaced any severance benefits related to a change of control provided for in the NEOs’ respective offer letters, as applicable and as confirmed by acknowledgment letter. Change of Control Under the 2021 Plan Pursuant to the 2021 Plan, if 23andMe experiences a change of control where 23andMe is not the surviving corporation (or survives only as a subsidiary of another corporation), unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, all outstanding grants that are not exercised or paid at the time of the change of control will be assumed, or replaced with grants (with respect to cash, securities, or a combination thereof) that have comparable terms, by the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation). If there is a change of control and all outstanding grants are not assumed or replaced with grants that have comparable terms, by the surviving corporation, the Compensation Committee may (but is not obligated to) make adjustments to the terms and conditions of outstanding grants, including, without limitation, taking any of the following actions (or combination thereof) without the consent of any participant:
•
determine that outstanding options and SARs will accelerate and become fully exercisable and the restrictions and conditions on outstanding stock awards, stock units, and dividend equivalents immediately lapse;
•
pay participants, in an amount and form determined by the Compensation Committee, in settlement of outstanding stock units or dividend equivalents;
•
require that participants surrender their outstanding stock options and SARs in exchange for a payment by us, in cash or shares of Class A common stock, equal to the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the underlying shares of Class A common stock; provided, however, that if the per share fair market value of Class A common stock does not exceed the per share stock option exercise price or SARs base amount, as applicable, 23andMe will not be required to make any payment to the participant upon surrender of the stock option or SAR and shall have the right to cancel any such option or SAR for no consideration; or
•
after giving participants an opportunity to exercise all of their outstanding stock options and SARs, terminate any unexercised stock options and SARs on the date determined by the Compensation Committee. In general terms, a change of control under the 2021 Plan occurs if:
•
a person, entity, or affiliated group, with certain exceptions, acquires more than 50% of the then-outstanding voting securities;
•
23andMe merges into another entity, unless the holders of voting shares immediately prior to the merger have at least 50% of the combined voting power of the securities in the merged entity or its parent;
•
23andMe merges into another entity and the members of the Board prior to the merger would not constitute a majority of the board of the merged entity or its parent;
•
23andMe sells or disposes of all or substantially all of the assets of 23andMe;
•
23andMe consummates a complete liquidation or dissolution; or
•
a majority of the members of the Board is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the incumbent directors.  17 Table of ContentsExcept with respect to Anne Wojcicki, William Richards, and Kathy Hibbs, the following table describes the approximate payments that would have been made to the NEOs pursuant to agreements, plans, or individual award agreements in effect on March 31, 2025, in the event of the termination of employment of the NEOs under the circumstances described below, assuming such terminations took place on March 31, 2025.

Anne Wojcicki Payments upon a Termination of Employment On March 21, 2025, Anne Wojcicki, by mutual agreement between Ms. Wojcicki and the Special Committee, tendered her resignation as an officer of the Company to the Board, which such resignation was effective at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on March 23, 2025. Ms. Wojcicki did not receive any severance in connection with her resignation. As Ms. Wojcicki continues to serve as a Class III director on the Board, her equity awards continue to vest pursuant to their original grant terms. Bill Richards Payments upon a Termination of Employment On August 5, 2024, Bill Richards tendered his resignation to the Company and resigned from any and all positions held at the Company and/or its subsidiaries effective August 23, 2024 (the “Resignation Effective Date”). In connection therewith, on August 6, 2024, the Compensation Committee approved the provision of the following severance benefits to Mr. Richards: a lump sum payment of $253,500 (equivalent to six months of base salary), subject to applicable withholding; continued healthcare benefits through COBRA for the six-month period following the Resignation Effective Date; and an acceleration of vesting of 90,265 RSUs, which represents the number of RSUs that would have vested in the six-month period following the Resignation Effective Date had Mr. Richards remained employed by the Company.  18 Table of ContentsKathy Hibbs Payments upon a Termination of Employment On March 26, 2024, Kathy Hibbs delivered to the Company a letter informing the Company of her intention to retire from her employment with the Company, effective as of May 24, 2024. Effective on such date, Ms. Hibbs ceased to serve as the Company’s Chief Administrative Officer. Ms. Hibbs did not receive any severance in connection with her retirement and forfeited all unvested equity awards upon her retirement. Pay Ratio As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the ratio of (i) the sum of (x) the total compensation provided to our current Interim CEO, Joseph Selsavage, from March 23, 2025 to March 31, 2025 and (y) the total compensation provided to our former CEO, Anne Wojcicki, from April 1, 2024 to March 23, 2025 (ii) to that of our median employee. In making this pay ratio disclosure, other companies may use assumptions, estimates, and methodologies different than ours; as a result, the following information may not be directly comparable to the information provided by other companies in our peer group or otherwise. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. The sum of (i) Mr. Selsavage’s total compensation from March 23, 2025 to March 31, 2025 (i.e., the Fiscal 2025 period during which he served as Interim CEO) and (ii) Ms. Wojcicki’s total compensation from April 1, 2024 to March 23, 2025 (i.e., the Fiscal 2025 period during which she served as CEO), calculated pursuant to SEC rules, was $79,544. The annual total compensation of the median employee of the Company for Fiscal 2025, calculated pursuant to SEC rules, was $242,581. Accordingly, the ratio of the combined CEO annual total compensation to that of the median employee of the Company was approximately 3:1 for Fiscal 2025. In identifying the median employee, we used the following methodology. We used total direct compensation as our compensation measure and a determination date of March 31, 2025 (the “Determination Date”). Total direct compensation is (i) actual salary via payroll records, plus (ii) Fiscal 2025 AIP payout amount, plus (iii) retention and/or special cash and equity bonuses, plus (iv) annual equity grant. We believe that total direct compensation is an appropriate compensation measure because all of our employees are eligible to participate in the AIP and receive equity grants. For new hires that were not employed for the entirety of Fiscal 2025, we annualized their respective base salaries. We then selected the median employee, having identified the Fiscal 2025 total direct compensation for all of our employees (excluding our Interim CEO and former CEO) on the Determination Date. We included all employees in our calculation and excluded interns. We did not make any other assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to our calculation of total direct compensation or our determination of the median employee. Pay Versus Performance The following information is presented to disclose the relationship between executive compensation actually paid (“CAP”), as calculated under applicable SEC rules, and the Company’s financial performance. As required by SEC rules, the table presented below discloses CAP for (i) the Company’s principal executive officers (“PEOs”) and (ii) the Company’s NEOs other than the PEOs (the “Non-PEO NEOs”), on an average basis. The methodology for calculating amounts presented in the columns “CAP to PEO 1,” “CAP to PEO 2,” and “Average CAP to Non-PEO NEOs,” including details regarding the amounts that were deducted from, and added to, the Summary Compensation Table (“SCT”) totals to arrive at the values presented for CAP, are provided in the footnotes to the table. A narrative discussion of the relationship between CAP and the Company performance measures (i) listed in the table below and (ii) that the Company has deemed most important in linking CAP during Fiscal 2025 to Company performance is also presented below.  19 Table of ContentsPay Versus Performance (“PvP”) Table

The dollar amounts reported in columns (c1), (c2), and (e) represent the amounts of CAP to PEOs and average CAP to Non-PEO NEOs, respectively. CAP does not necessarily represent cash and/or equity value transferred to the PEOs or applicable Non-PEO NEO without restriction, but rather is a value calculated in accordance with applicable SEC rules. As the Company does not have a defined benefit plan, no adjustments for pension benefits are included in the below tables. Similarly, no adjustments were made for dividends, as the Company has not paid any dividends. The following table sets forth the adjustments made to calculate CAP to PEO 1, as shown in column (c1):

For purposes of calculating peer group total shareholder return (“TSR”), the S&P 500 Healthcare Sector Index (the “Peer Group TSR”) was utilized pursuant to Item 201(e) of Regulation S-K and as is reflected in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2025. In accordance with applicable SEC rules, the Peer Group TSR was calculated on a market capitalization weighted basis according to the respective issuers’ stock market capitalization at the beginning of each period for which a return is indicated. TSR for both the Company and the peer group is based on an initial $100 investment, measured on a cumulative basis from the market close on June 17, 2021 (the date the Company’s Class A common stock commenced publicly trading), through and including the end of the fiscal year for which TSR is being presented in the table. TSR calculations reflect reinvestment of dividends.
(6)
We identified Gross Margin as our Company-Selected Measure that represents, in our view, the most important measure used to link CAP to performance for Fiscal 2025. Gross Margin was the heaviest weighted (75%) performance measure in the Fiscal 2025 AIP.  21 Table of ContentsNarrative Discussion of Relationship Between CAP and Financial Performance Measures One objective of the “Pay Versus Performance Table” is to illustrate how performance-based features in our executive compensation program operate to index pay to performance. As further explained below, we believe that the table generally reflects an alignment of CAP with the Company’s performance on key financial performance measures. Additionally, the graphs shown below illustrate the relationship between CAP and (i) the Company and Peer Group TSRs, (ii) Net Income (Loss), and (iii) Gross Margin. TSR: As depicted below, a comparison of the Company’s cumulative TSR versus the cumulative Peer Group TSR from June 17, 2021 through the end of Fiscal 2025, shows that the CAP values are generally aligned with the Company’s stock price performance and generally reflect the Company’s historic practice of using equity incentives that are directly related to stock price performance.
22 Table of ContentsNet Income (Loss): SEC rules require that net income be presented as a performance measure in the PVP Table above; however, no portion of the PEOs’ or the Non-PEO NEOs’ compensation is directly tied to Net Income (Loss).
Gross Margin: Gross Margin was the heaviest weighted (75%) performance measure in the Fiscal 2025 AIP; however, in prior fiscal years, the only performance measure for the AIP was Adjusted EBITDA.* Accordingly, there is not a strong correlation between CAP values and Gross Margin results for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2023, and Fiscal 2024.
23 Table of ContentsImportant Financial Performance Measures For Fiscal 2025, Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA* were the only financial performance measures used by the Company to link CAP (for all NEOs) to Company performance. Because there were only two metrics, the Company chose not to use a tabular format. For additional information related to how the Compensation Committee assessed the Company’s performance and established compensation for the NEOs, see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis.
*
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest income (expense), net other income (expense), income tax expenses (benefit), depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, stock-based compensation expense, and other items that are considered unusual or not representative of underlying trends of our business, including, but not limited to: changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, litigation settlements, gains or losses on dispositions of subsidiaries, acquisition transaction-related costs, and cybersecurity incident expenses, net of probable insurance recoveries, if applicable for the periods presented.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence
RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
Related Person Transaction Approval Policy
The Board has adopted the 23andMe Holding Co. Related Person Transaction Approval Policy (the “RPT Policy”). The RPT Policy applies to any transaction (each, a “Related Person Transaction”) in which:
•
23andMe or a subsidiary, partnership, joint venture, or other business association that is effectively controlled by 23andMe, directly or indirectly, is, was, or will be a participant in the transaction;
•
the amount of the transaction exceeds $120,000; and
•
a Related Person (as defined below) has, had, or will have a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction.
Under the RPT Policy, a “Related Person” is (i) any director or executive officer of 23andMe, (ii) any nominee for director (when the information called for by the rules and regulations of the SEC is being presented in a proxy or information statement related to the election of that nominee for director), (iii) any stockholder of 23andMe known to 23andMe to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of 23andMe’s voting securities (a “5% or Greater Holder”), and (iv) any immediate family member of any such person.
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing Related Person Transactions and approving, ratifying, revising, or rejecting Related Person Transactions in accordance with the RPT Policy. Company management is responsible for determining whether a transaction is a Related Person Transaction, including whether the Related Person has a material interest, based on a review of all facts and circumstances, which includes, without limitation, information provided to management in the annual director and officer questionnaires. Upon determination by management that a transaction is a Related Person Transaction and therefore requires review by the Audit Committee, the material facts respecting the Related Person Transaction and the Related Person’s interest in such Related Person Transaction are reported to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is entitled to rely on such determinations by management.
Related Person Transactions
The following sets forth a summary of the Related Person Transactions during Fiscal 2025, all of which were approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the RPT Policy.
Transactions with Related Persons in Fiscal 2024
GSK Agreement
The Company considers Glaxo Group Limited to be a 5% or Greater Holder. From July 2018 to July 2023, we were party to an exclusive collaboration agreement with an affiliate of GlaxoSmithKline (“GSK”) (the “original GSK Agreement”) to leverage genetic insights to validate, rapidly progress development, and commercialize useful new drugs. As of July 2023, we are able to pursue new target discovery collaborations with other parties that leverage our extensive database, research capabilities and successful drug discovery track record. In October 2023, we entered into an amendment to the original GSK Agreement (the “2023 GSK Amendment” and, together with the original GSK Agreement, the “GSK Agreements”) to provide GSK with a non-exclusive license to certain new, de-identified, aggregated data from our database (the “New Data”), as well as access to certain of our research services with respect to such New Data. During Fiscal 2025, the Company recognized revenue of $19.7 million under the GSK Agreements, and as of March 31, 2025, the Company had deferred revenue of $0.3 million related to the GSK Agreements.
29
TWF Agreement
In January 2024, the Company entered into a research services agreement (the “TWF Agreement”) and related statement of work (the “initial SOW”) with the Troper Wojcicki Foundation (“TWF”) with the goal of expanding scientific knowledge in the field of lung cancer using the Company’s phenotype and genotype data to build large scale research cohorts. At the time, Susan Wojcicki was a director and officer of TWF, and a sibling of the Company’s former CEO and current member of the Board of Directors, Anne Wojcicki, and therefore the Company determined that TWF is a related party. The TWF Agreement has a term of five years through December 21, 2028. The fees under the initial SOW are $5.4 million, payable in installments over the term of the TWF Agreement, with certain payments being subject to the achievement of specified milestones. The Company recognized revenue from the TWF Agreement of $0.7 million in Fiscal 2025. As of March 31, 2025, the Company had deferred revenue of $1.4 million associated with the TWF Agreement.
Consulting Agreement with Richard Scheller
Richard Scheller serves as a director on our Board. Effective April 1, 2019, Dr. Scheller executed a consulting agreement with 23andMe, Inc. (the “Scheller Consulting Agreement”). The Scheller Consulting Agreement provided that Dr. Scheller would serve as a consultant for the one-year period of April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, at a rate of $10,000 a month. The Scheller Consulting Agreement was amended on March 30, 2020 to extend the term of the Scheller Consulting Agreement through March 31, 2021 and to address minor ministerial updates. Effective March 24, 2021, a second amendment to the Scheller Consulting Agreement further extended the term of the Scheller Consulting Agreement through March 31, 2022. Effective March 24, 2022, a third amendment to the Scheller Consulting Agreement further extended the term of the Scheller Consulting Agreement through March 31, 2023. Effective March 10, 2023, a fourth amendment to the Scheller Consulting Agreement further extended the term of the Scheller Consulting Agreement through March 31, 2024. During Fiscal 2025, the Company paid Dr. Scheller $10,000 pursuant to the Scheller Consulting Agreement.
BOARD INDEPENDENCE
As our securities were previously listed on Nasdaq, we use the standards of “independence” prescribed by rules set forth by Nasdaq. Under Nasdaq rules, a majority of a listed company’s board of directors must be comprised of independent directors. Under Nasdaq rules, a director will only qualify as an “independent director” if, in the opinion of that company’s board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out a director’s responsibilities. Our Board has determined that the following directors are independent under Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations: Andre Fernandez, Jim Frankola, Mark Jensen, and Thomas Walper. Additionally, the Board determined that the following Resigning Directors were independent during their respective tenures as directors: Roelof Botha, Patrick Chung, Sandra Hernández, Neal Mohan, Valerie Montgomery Rice, and Peter Taylor. As Anne Wojcicki served as our Chief Executive Officer until March 23, 2025 and Richard Scheller, a Resigning Director, provided consulting services to the Company during Fiscal 2025, they are not deemed to be independent.

PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
Our Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures relating to the approval of all audit and non-audit services that are to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. This policy generally provides that we will not engage our independent registered public accounting firm to render audit or non-audit services unless the service is specifically approved in advance by the Audit Committee or the engagement is entered into pursuant to the pre-approval procedures described below.
From time to time, the Audit Committee may pre-approve specified types of services that are expected to be provided to us by our independent registered public accounting firm during the next 12 months. Any such pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or type of services to be provided and is also generally subject to a maximum dollar amount.
All of the services rendered by KPMG to the Company and our subsidiaries during Fiscal 2025 were pre-approved by our Audit Committee.
