Forward-looking
statements
Statements
made in this Form 10-K that are not historical or current facts are “forward-looking statements” made pursuant to the safe
harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,”
“believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “approximate” or “continue,” or the
negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution
readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking
statements represent management’s best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject
to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from
historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to
revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence
of anticipated or unanticipated events.
Financial
information contained in this report and in our financial statements is stated in United States dollars and is prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
Our
shares of commons stock are shares of Addentax Group Corp., our Nevada holding company, which has no material operations of its own and
conducts substantially all of its operations through the operating companies established in the People’s Republic of China, or
the PRC, primarily Shenzhen Qianhai Yingxi Industrial Chain Service Co., Ltd. (“YX”), our wholly owned subsidiary and its
subsidiaries. We are not a Chinese operating company. We are a holding company and do not directly own any substantive business operations
in China. Therefore, our investors will not directly hold any equity interests in our Chinese operating companies. Our holding company
structure involves unique risks to investors. Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our operating structure, which would likely
result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), including that it could cause the value of such securities
to significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description of risks related to the holding corporate structure, see “Risk
Factors—Risks Relating to Our Holding Company Structure” for detailed discussions.
Additionally,
as we conduct substantially all of our operations through the operating companies established in the PRC, we are subject to certain
legal and operational risks associated with our business operations in China. PRC laws and regulations governing our current
business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain, and we face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could
have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business. Therefore,
these risks arising from being associated with, based in or having substantially all of our operations through the operating
companies established in China could cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Furthermore, these
risks may result in a material change in our business operations or a complete hindrance of our ability to offer or continue to
offer our securities to investors. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate
business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market,
enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to
extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. The business of our subsidiaries
until the filing date of this Form 10K is not subject to cybersecurity review with the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC,
given that: (i) our products and services are offered not directly to individual users but through our institutional customers; (ii)
we do not possess a large amount of personal information in our business operations; and (iii) data processed in our business does
not have a bearing on national security and thus may not be classified as core or important data by the authorities. Further, we
believe our newly established companies and our business plan will not change the above conclusion. In addition, we are not subject
to merger control review by China’s anti-monopoly enforcement agency due to the level of our revenues as provided by us and
audited by our auditor Pan-China Singapore PAC, and the fact that we currently do not expect to propose or implement any acquisition of
control of, or decisive influence over, any company with revenues within China of more than RMB400 million. Currently, these
statements and regulatory actions have had no impact on our daily business operation, our ability to accept foreign investments or our ability to
list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. As of the date of this Form 10-K, no effective laws or regulations in
the PRC explicitly require us to seek approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”) or any other
PRC governmental authorities for our overseas listing, nor has our company or any of our subsidiaries received any inquiry, notice,
warning or sanctions regarding our overseas listing from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities. However, since these
statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies
will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or
promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation,
the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. See “Risk
Factors” beginning on page 17 for a discussion of these legal and operational risks and other information that should be
considered before making a decision to purchase our common stock.

As
a holding company, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and to service any debt we may incur may depend upon dividends paid
by our PRC Subsidiaries. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC Subsidiaries to pay dividends to us through Yingxi Industrial Chain Investment
Co., Ltd. (“Yingxi HK”), our intermediate holding subsidiary in Hong Kong, only out of their accumulated profits, if any,
determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our PRC Subsidiaries is required to
set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its
registered capital. As of the date hereof, we have had no transactions that involved the transfer of cash or assets throughout our corporate
structure. The PRC Subsidiaries have not transferred cash or other assets to Addentax, including by way of dividends. Addentax does not
currently plan or anticipate transferring cash or other assets from our operations in China to any non-Chinese entity. As of the date
hereof, no transfers, dividends, or distributions have been made to our investors.
Trading
in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, if the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”) determines that it cannot inspect or investigate completely our
auditor. Pursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report on December 16, 2021 which found that the PCAOB is unable to
inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in: (1) mainland China of the People’s
Republic of China because of a position taken by one or more authorities in mainland China; and (2) Hong Kong, a Special
Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong. In addition,
the PCAOB’s report identified the specific registered public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations. The
PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections in China without the approval of Chinese government authorities. If it is later
determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, investors may be deprived of the benefits of
such inspection. Any audit reports not issued by auditors that are completely inspected by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections
of audit work undertaken in China that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditors’ audits and their quality
control procedures, could result in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and disclosures are adequate and accurate. Our
auditor, Pan-China Singapore PAC, is an independent registered public accounting firm with the PCAOB, and as an auditor of publicly
traded companies in the U.S., is subject to laws in the U.S. pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its
compliance with the applicable professional standards. Pan-China Singapore PAC is based in Singapore and there are no limitations in
Singapore on PCAOB inspections. Pan-China Singapore PAC is not headquartered in mainland China or Hong Kong and was not identified
as a firm subject to the determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. Should the PCAOB be unable to fully conduct an
inspection of our auditor’s work papers in China, it will make it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our
auditor’s audit procedures or equity control procedures. Investors may consequently lose confidence in our reported financial
information and procedures or quality of the financial statements, which would adversely affect us and our securities. On August 26,
2022, the PCAOB announced that it had signed the “Protocol” with the CSRC and the MOF, which governs inspections and
investigations of audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong. The Protocol remains unpublished and is subject to further
explanation and implementation. Pursuant to the fact sheet with respect to the Protocol released by the U.S Securities and Exchanges
Commission (the “SEC”), the PCAOB shall have independent discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and the
unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC. According to the PCAOB, its December 2021 determinations under the HFCAA
remain in effect. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it has completed a test inspection of two selected auditing firms
in mainland China and Hong Kong and has voted to vacate its previous Determination Report, which concluded in December 2021 that the
PCAOB could not inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms based in mainland China or Hong Kong. On
December 23, 2022, the AHFCAA was enacted, which amended the HFCAA by requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities
from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of
three and such act was signed into law on December 29, 2022. It is possible that the PCAOB may reassess its determinations in the
future, and it could determine that it is still unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms in
mainland China and Hong Kong. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and related regulations currently previously did not
affect the Company as the Company’s auditor is subject to PCAOB’s inspections and investigations. Furthermore, on June
22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed AHFCAA and on December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law by
President Biden, which contained, among other things, an identical provision to AHFCAA and amended the Holding Foreign Companies
Accountable Act by requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its
auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time before your
securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted. The delisting or the cessation of trading of our Common Stock, or the
threat of their being delisted or prohibited from being traded, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.
The PCAOB continues to demand complete access in mainland China and Hong Kong moving forward and has resumed regular inspections
since March 2023. Moreover, if trading in our securities is prohibited under the HFCAA in the future because the PCAOB determines
that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor at such future time, an exchange may determine to delist our
securities.

Summary
of Risk Factors
Investing
in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Below is a summary of material factors that make an investment in our common stock
speculative or risky. Importantly, this summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Please refer to the information contained
in and incorporated by reference under the heading “Risk Factors” on page 17 of this Form 10-K.
Risks
Associated with Our Company
●
Our
success depends on our customers’ ability to market and sell their products manufactured by us.
●
Our
future expansion plans are subject to uncertainties and risks.
●
Future
price increases in raw materials or changes in the supply of raw materials may materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
●
Any
labor shortages, increased labor costs or other factors affecting labor supply for our production materials may materially and adversely
affect our business operations.
●
If
we are unable to attract additional customers and clients to purchase our services (and future
products we may develop or sell) it will have a negative effect on our ability to generate
revenue.
●
A
recent joint statement by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or the “PCAOB,”
proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the newly enacted “Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act” all call
for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors,
especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB. These developments could add uncertainties to investing in us.
●
There
are uncertainties under the PRC Securities Law relating to the procedures and requisite timing for the U.S. securities regulatory
agencies to conduct investigations and collect evidence within the territory of the PRC.
●
We
face risks associated with future Chinese regulations.
●
We
may be exposed to concentration risk due to heavy reliance on third-party contractors for our logistic business, and any shortage of
third-party contractors may significantly impact our business and results of operation.
●
If
we are unable to control the reliance of third-party contractors efficiently and effectively, our business prospects and results
of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
●
We
have a limited operating history for the new business segment of property management and subleasing, which makes it difficult to
evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful. In addition, our historical growth rates
and profitability may not be indicative of our future growth and profitability.
●
Natural
disasters, public health crises or other catastrophic events may significantly limit our ability to conduct business as normal, disrupt
our business operation and materially affect our financial condition.
●
We
may not succeed in continuing to maintain, protect and strengthen our reputation, and any negative publicity about us, our business,
our management, our business partners, may materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and growth.
General
Risks Associated with Business Operations in China
●
Investors
may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.
●
Changes
in the policies, regulations, rules and the enforcement of laws of the PRC government may be quick with little advance notice and
could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business.
●
The
PRC government may intervene or influence our business operations at any time or may exert more control over offerings conducted
overseas and foreign investment in China based issuers, which could result in a material change in our business operations and/or
the value of our securities. Additionally, the governmental and regulatory interference could significantly limit or completely hinder
our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline
or be worthless.
5
●
Our
independent registered public accounting firm’s audit documentation related to their audit reports included in this Form 10-K
include audit documentation located in the PRC. Our Common Stocks may be delisted or prohibited from being traded over-the-counter
under the HFCAA if the PCAOB is unable to inspect our audit documentation located in mainland China and, as such, you may be deprived
of the benefits of such inspection which could result in limitations or restrictions to our access to the U.S. capital markets. The
delisting or the cessation of trading of our Common Stocks, or the threat of their being delisted or prohibited from being traded,
may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.
●
To
the extent cash in the business is in the PRC or a PRC entity, the funds may not be available to fund operations or for other use
outside of the PRC due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the ability of our Company or our
subsidiaries by the PRC government to transfer cash.
●
Any
actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment
in China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors
and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.
●
Foreign
exchange fluctuations may affect our business.
●
Inflation
could pose a risk to our business.
●
There
are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws, rules and regulations.
●
PRC
regulations regarding acquisitions impose significant regulatory approval and review requirements, which could make it more difficult
for us to pursue growth through acquisitions.

PART
I
Item
1. Business
Addentax
Group Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 28, 2014. We were originally incorporated to produce images on multiple
surfaces, such as glass, leather, plastic, ceramic, textile, and others using a 3D sublimation vacuum heat transfer machine. We no longer
pursue opportunities related to 3D printing positioning.
On
December 28, 2016, we entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with Yingxi Industrial Chain Group Co., Ltd.
(“YICG”), which was incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles and principally engaged in garment
manufacture, where we agreed to acquire 100% of the equity interest in YICG and to issue two million five hundred thousand
(2,500,000) restricted common shares of the Company to former owners of YICG (after giving effect to all subsequent share splits, combinations or similar transactions). The completion of the SPA took place on September 25,
2017. Following the completion of the SPA, YICG’s business became our business.
We
have a fiscal year-end of March 31. The business office is located at Kingkey 100, Block A, Room 4805, Luohu District, Shenzhen City,
China 518000. Our telephone number is +(86) 755 8233 0336.
Current
Business
We
(Addentax Group Corp.) are a Nevada holding company with no material operations of our own. We conduct substantially all of our
operations through our operating companies established in the PRC, primarily YX, our wholly owned subsidiary and its subsidiaries.
We are not a Chinese operating company. We are a holding company and do not directly own any substantive business operations in
China. Our holding company structure involves unique risks to investors. Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our operating
structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our common stock, including that it
could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. Our holding company, Addentax Group Corp., is
listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol of “ATXG”. We classify our businesses into three main segments:
garment manufacturing, logistics services, and property management and subleasing. The Company previously engaged in the provision
of epidemic prevention supplies, which included manufacturing, distribution and trading of epidemic prevention supplies. As the
COVID-19 pandemic became an endemic, only the Company ceased to operate in this business in the first quarter of 2023. The remaining
assets of this business segment were reclassified into the “Corporate and others” segment. The corresponding items of
segment information for the earlier periods were restated to reflect the change of the new segment structure.
Unless
the context otherwise requires, all references in this Form 10-K to “Addentax” refer to Addentax Group Corp., a holding
company, and references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Registrant”, the “Company,”

is the entity in which investors are investing.
Our
subsidiaries include (i) Yingxi Industrial Chain Group Co., Ltd., a Republic of Seychelles company; (ii) Yingxi HK; (iii) Qianhai
Yingxi Textile & Garments Co., Ltd., a PRC company; (iv) YX, (v) Dongguan Heng Sheng Wei Garments Co., Ltd, a PRC company

Xin Kuai Jie Transportation Co., Ltd, a PRC company (“XKJ”), (vii) AOT,
and (viii) Dongguan Hongxiang Commercial Co., Ltd., a PRC company (“HX”).

Our
garment manufacturing business consists of sales made principally to wholesalers located in the PRC. We have our own manufacturing facilities,
with sufficient production capacity and skilled workers on production lines to ensure that we meet our high quality control standards
and timely meet the delivery requirements for our customers. We conduct our garment manufacturing operations through five wholly owned
subsidiaries, namely Dongguan Heng Sheng Wei Garments Co., Ltd (“HSW”), Dongguan Yushang Clothing Co., Ltd (“YS”)
and Dongguan Aotesi Garments Co., Ltd., (“AOT”), which are located in the Guangdong province, China.
Our
logistics business consists of delivery and courier services covering 44 cities in 10 provinces and 2 municipalities in China. Although
we have our own motor vehicles and drivers, we currently outsource some of the business to our contractors. We believe outsourcing allows
us to maximize our capacity and maintain flexibility while reducing capital expenditures and the costs of keeping drivers during slow
seasons. We conduct our logistics operations through two wholly owned subsidiaries, namely Shenzhen Xin Kuai Jie Transportation Co., Ltd
(“XKJ”) and Shenzhen Yingxi Peng Fa Logistic Co., Ltd (“PF”), which are located in the Guangdong province, China.
Our
property management and subleasing business provides shop subleasing and property management services for garment wholesalers and
retailers in the garment market. We currently have an aggregate of 56,238 square meters of floor space and provide approximately
1,300 shop spaces to clients. We conduct our property management and subleasing operation through a wholly owned subsidiary acquired
in September 2023, namely Dongguan Hongxiang Commercial Co., Ltd., a PRC company (“HX”), which is located in the
Guangdong province, China.
Competitive
Strengths
We
believe we have the following competitive strengths:
Cost-effective
production. We have adopted a vertical integration production process. We produce garments in our own production facilities and employ
our in-house transport teams to deliver garments to our customers. This one-stop service optimizes production efficiency and saves costs
by lowering the cost per unit, thereby achieving economies of scale.
Stringent
quality control process. As of March 31, 2025, we had 20 employees in the production department
that are responsible for conducting our quality control process. We implement a stringent quality control process which monitors various
stages of our garment manufacturing business, including sampling checks of semi-finished products and finished products. We prepare inspection
reports to address the quality problems and make recommendations to improve the quality of our products. During final product inspection,
we pay special attention to the measurements, workmanship, ironing and packaging of our products to help best ensure that the quality
of our products comply with the specifications, standards and requirements of our customers.
Strong
design capabilities. Our design team works closely with our customers to understand their needs and make recommendations to them.
Our design team also conducts market research and attends industry exhibitions to understand the latest market trends. As of March 31,
2025, our design team consisted of 3
members.
8
Extensive
delivery network. Our logistics business has nine routes and covers 45 cities in 10 provinces and 2 municipalities in the PRC.
Strategic
location and infrastructure. Our property management and subleasing business operates through Dongguan Hongxiang Commercial Co.,
Ltd. (HX), located in Guangdong province, China, which is a key area for the garment market. By securing a prime location and
developing a well-maintained infrastructure, we provide attractive and convenient spaces for garment wholesalers and retailers,
enhancing their operational efficiency and appeal to customers.
Comprehensive
property services. We provide a wide range of property management services, including security, maintenance, and customer support,
to ensure a high standard of service for our tenants. This comprehensive solution helps to foster a favorable business environment for
garment wholesalers and retailers, enhancing tenant satisfaction and retentions.
Business
Strategies
Key
elements of our business and growth strategies include the following:
Sales
of raw materials. We intend to enter into exclusive agreements with textile and garment suppliers in Southeast China to be their
exclusive agent and supply their textiles and garments to our customers. To execute this plan, we intend to set up several retailers
for the sales of textiles and garments to retail customers and supply the textiles and garments exclusively to various high-end fashion
brands.
Development
of our own brands. We intend to develop our own brands that focus on fast fashion with teenagers being our primary target customers.
We plan to adopt a low-cost strategy at the early stage and improve the quality of our products after increasing our market share. We
are in the process of registering a trademark for our own brand and intend to start our advertising campaign after the registration of
this trademark. We plan to distribute our products in different channels, including our own retailers, co-operative retailers and franchisees.
Expand
our delivery network. As of March 31, 2025, we provided logistics services to over 45 cities in 10 provinces and 2 municipalities
in the PRC. We expect to develop 20 additional logistics routes in existing serving cities and improve the Company’s profits in
the year 2025.
Develop
international logistics services and warehousing services. We intend to develop international logistics services for customers located
all over the world and international warehousing services.
Develop
E-commerce business. We integrated resources in shopping malls and we intend to develop e-commerce bases and the internet celebrity
economy together to increase the value of the stores in the area.
Enhance
tenant experience through value-added services. We aim to offer a range of value-added services to our tenants, including property
maintenance, marketing support, and business consulting. These services are designed to help tenants improve their business operations,
attract more customers, and increase their profitability, thereby enhancing tenant retention and satisfaction.
Develop
digital solutions for property management. We plan to implement advanced digital solutions to streamline our property management
processes. This includes the use of property management software for lease administration, tenant communication, and maintenance scheduling.
By leveraging technology, we aim to improve operational efficiency and provide a seamless experience for our tenants.
Leverage
data analytics for informed decision-making. We plan to utilize data analytics to gain insights into market trends, tenant preferences,
and property performance. By analyzing this data, we can make informed decisions on property acquisitions, rental pricing, and tenant
services, ultimately optimizing our property management and subleasing operations.
Enhance
customer service and support. We intend to improve our customer service and support by providing dedicated tenant support teams and
implementing tenant feedback mechanisms. Exceptional customer service will help build strong relationships with tenants and improve overall
satisfaction.

Our
garment manufacturing business
We
manufacture garments for various high-end fashion brands through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, HSW, YS, AOT, which are located in Guangdong
province, the PRC.
Operations
Our
customer relationship team is responsible for cultivating and maintaining our relationship with customers.
Our
design team works closely with our customer relationship team to understand our customers’ needs and make recommendations to them
based on their designs.
Our
fabric team leverages our experience in fabric sourcing as well as our understanding of fabric features to recommend the types of fabric
to be used in our customers’ products. Our fabric team may also suggest alternative fabrics to our customers. Our fabric team works
with our research and development team to understand fabric types and aims to identify different fabric we source and improve the quality
and comfort of the fabric we produce.
Our
product and technical team are mainly responsible for development samples of products, preparing structural and production guidance of
products as well as producing paper patterns for our garment production team. Upon order confirmation from our customers, our customer
relationship team informs our fabric team to carry out raw material sourcing.
We
source finished fabric and yarns from our suppliers for garment production. The procedures for fabric production are normally divided
into the following stages: (i) spinning; (ii) weaving or knitting; (iii) dyeing or printing; and (iv) finishing. Generally, our fabric
team requires four to six weeks to source raw materials from our suppliers.
Our
garment production team is responsible for producing garments based on the raw materials we source. The major stages involved in garment
production include: (i) paper patterning; (ii) fabric cutting; (iii) sewing; (iv) interim quality inspection; (v) trimming; (vi) washing;
and (vii) ironing.
Seasonality
We
generally receive more purchase orders during our second and third quarters and fewer manufacture orders during May and June.
Credit
period
For
our long-term and established customers with good payment track records, we generally provide payment terms between 30 to 180 days following
the delivery of finished goods. For our new customers, we generally require advances or deposits to be made when placing orders.
Our
logistics business
We
pack products and provide logistics service to our customers through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, XKJ and PF which are located in Guangdong
province, the PRC. Our in-house logistics teams deliver to approximately 10 provinces and 2 municipalities in the PRC.
Where
a customer is located in an area not covered by our delivery fleet or where our in-house logistics teams are fully engaged, we will outsource
delivery to third-party contractors. We believe outsourcing allows us to maximize our delivery capacity and improve inventory flexibility
while minimizing capital expenditures, such as shipping costs and the costs of additional drivers during low seasons.
10
Our
logistics services
We
provide comprehensive logistics services to our customers, which include storage, transportation, warehousing, handling, packaging and
order processing. We also provide customs declaration and tax clearance services to our customers who export goods overseas.

We
have 114 logistics points and they are located in 10 provinces and 2 municipalities which cover 45 cities in the PRC.
Our
internal management
Our
management in the logistics business is responsible for setting out business strategies and managing the daily operation. Specifically,
they have regular meetings with different departments, conduct inspections and supervise the finance department, operation department
and administration department.
Seasonality
We
generally receive more delivery orders in our third and fourth quarters and are more vulnerable to shipping delays in the PRC during
the Chinese New Year due to traffic and port congestion, border crossing delays and customs clearance issues.
Credit
period
We
generally require payments from the customers between 30 to 90 days following their acknowledgement of receipt of goods.
Customers
and Suppliers

Our
customer base is diverse. Our customers are as follows: (i) our customers in the garment manufacturing business are mainly garment
wholesalers and retailers, (ii) our customers in the logistics business are mainly trading companies and logistic companies, and
(iii) our customers in the property management and subleasing business are manufacturing companies and e-commerce companies. There
were two customers that accounted for more than 10% of our net sales for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

owners. There was one supplier that accounted for more than 10% of our total cost for both years ended March 31, 2025 and
2024.
Inventory
Garment
manufacturing business. We maintain our raw materials in our storage facilities. We review our inventory levels in order to identify
slow-moving materials and broken assortments.
Logistics
business. Since we deliver products as soon as we receive orders from customers, we do not operate distribution centers and hence
do not need to carry a significant amount of inventory.
Our
property management and subleasing business. We do not need to carry a significant amount of inventory due to the nature of the business.
Intellectual
Property
The
Company, through its subsidiary YX, received the approval
of the trademarks below in relation to its business from PRC government.
11
Competition
While
the PRC is still the world’s largest clothing manufacturer with enormous production capacity, oversupply, increasing labor costs
and rising local protectionism have eroded its competitiveness.
The
principal competitive factors in the garment manufacturing market include:
●
brand
awareness and focus;
●
breadth
of product offerings; and
●
quality
control.
The
principal competitive factors in the logistics market include:
●
delivery
time; and
●
network
coverage.
The
principal competitive factors in the property management and subleasing market include:
●
Cost
control; and
●
network
coverage.
We
believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of the above factors as a result of our market position and customer base.
By offering one-stop-shop services and affordable price points, we provide services to our customers that are difficult for other competitors
to address.
Employees
As
of March 31, 2025, we had approximately 112 employees and there was no labor union established by our employees. The following table
sets out a breakdown of the number of employees by function as of March 31, 2025:

According
to PRC regulations, we must participate in various employee social security plans organized by local governments, including pension,
unemployment insurance, childbirth insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance and housing insurance. We are also required
under PRC law to contribute to employee benefit plans at specified percentages of the salaries, bonuses and certain allowances of our
employees, up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time.
We
believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and to date we have not experienced any significant labor disputes.
Recent
Developments
Company
investment
On
January 8, 2025, we entered into that certain securities purchase agreement (the “Agreement”) to purchase 3,750,000
shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share (“Well Common Stock”), of Well Information Technology Corporation
(“Well InfoTech”), a company incorporated in the State of Nevada, for a total cash consideration of USD $750,000 (the
“Shares”). The Shares would constitute approximately 2.5% of the number of shares of Well Common Stock of Well InfoTech
immediately prior to the issuance of such Shares.
Supply
Chian Development
On
November 21, 2024, we signed a memorandum of understanding (the “MOU”) with Shenzhen Yingbin Brand Development Co., Ltd.
(“Yingbin Brand”), to establish the foundation for a nationwide strategic collaboration between the two companies which aims
to enhance company’s brand supply chain, product supply chain, and marketing supply chain services in China.
Government
Regulations
The
PRC government has corresponding industrial regulatory measures and policies for garment manufacturing business, logistics business and
property management and subleasing business. Our PRC subsidiaries currently comply with these regulatory requirements and have not received
any action from industry regulators for conduct of their business. The PRC government may, however, from time to time institute rules
and regulations on such businesses which makes it difficult or impossible for us to operate successfully, if at all, in the PRC. Please
see the section on “Risk Factors” for further details.
The
PRC government encourages small to medium-sized companies in traditional industries, such as garment manufacturing, to modernize their
business models with technological updates in order to sharpen their competitive edge in global markets.
PRC
Limitation on Overseas Listing and Share Issuances
Currently,
each of our PRC Subsidiaries holds and maintains a business license issued by the local market supervision and administration bureau,
and has received all requisite permissions and approvals in order to conduct and operate our business. Based on our understanding of
the PRC laws and regulations, our PRC businesses hold all the business licenses issued and approved from the relevant local authorities
and other administrative license required by its business, and do not require any other permissions or approvals to operate their PRC
business operations. As of the date of this report, none of our PRC Subsidiaries has been denied or punished by relevant governmental
authorities due to its business qualifications. In addition, we (Addentax Group Corp.) and our non-PRC subsidiaries have also received
all requisite permissions and approvals in order to conduct and operate our business.
In
order to promote domestic enterprises to carry out overseas capital market activities in accordance with law and compliance, the CSRC
issued the “Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies” and five supporting
guidelines (collectively referred to as the Overseas Listing Filing Rules) on February 17, 2023, and took effect on March 31, 2023. The
Overseas Listing Filing Rules clarify the relevant rules of the Chinese government on the management of overseas issuance, including
but not limited to (i) Initial public offerings or listings in overseas markets shall be filed with the CSRC within 3 working days after
the relevant application is submitted overseas. Subsequent securities offerings of an issuer in the same overseas market where it has
previously offered and listed securities shall be filed with the CSRC within 3 working days after the offering is completed. Subsequent
securities offerings and listings of an issuer in other overseas markets than where it has offered and listed shall be filed as Initial
public offerings; (ii) A negative list that prohibits overseas offering and listing; (iii) The reporting obligations of the issuer after
filing, such as the change of control, voluntary or mandatory delisting and other major changes after overseas issuance or listing, the
issuer should bear the obligation to report to the CSRC; (iv) Legal liability, such as failure to fulfill the filing procedures, or violation
of relevant regulations in overseas listing, the CSRC shall order rectification, issue warnings to such domestic company, and impose
a fine of between RMB 1,000,000 yuan and RMB 10,000,000 yuan. Directly liable persons-in-charge and other directly liable persons shall
be warned and each imposed a fine of between RMB 500,000 yuan and RMB 5,000,000 yuan.
13
According
to the Overseas Listing Filing Rules, the company, as an enterprise that has been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market before the new
regulations come into effect, does not need to apply to the CSRC for filing immediately. If it is issued and listed in other overseas
markets, it shall be filed in accordance with relevant regulations. On April 29, 2024, the Company entered into two private placement agreements with certain
individual investors for 330,000 shares of Common Stock each at a unit price of $0.98 per share and for a total of $646,800. After the transactions,
we shall be filed with the CSRC within three working days after the issuance of shares is completed. The Company has submitted the filing
application to the China Securities Regulatory Commission. As of June 29, 2025, the application is still pending. Accordingly, the Company’s
overseas issuances and subsequent additional issuances comply with the relevant provisions of the overseas listing filing regulation.
As the overseas listing filing process has not yet been completed, the outcome and subsequent requirements remain uncertain. As a result,
we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete all requirement for our future issuance in a timely manner and fully comply with
the relevant new rules, if any. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will not be subject to greater regulatory scrutiny or subsequent
interference by the Chinese government.
Transfers
of Cash to and from our Subsidiaries
We
(Addentax Group Corp.) are a Nevada holding company with no material operations of our own. We conduct substantially all of our operations
through the operating companies established in the PRC, primarily Shenzhen Qianhai Yingxi Industrial Chain Service Co., Ltd. (“YX”),
our wholly owned subsidiary and its subsidiaries. We are not a Chinese operating company. We are a holding company and do not directly
own any substantive business operations in China. As a result, although other means are available for us to obtain financing at the holding
company level, Addentax’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders and to service any debt it may incur may depend upon dividends
paid by our PRC Subsidiaries. If any of our subsidiaries incurs debt on its own in the future, the instruments governing such debt may
restrict its ability to pay dividends to Addentax. In addition, our PRC Subsidiaries are required to make appropriations to certain statutory
reserve funds, which are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of a solvent liquidation of the companies.
Current
PRC regulations permit our PRC Subsidiaries to pay dividends to us through Yingxi HK, our intermediate holding subsidiary in Hong Kong,
only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition,
each of our PRC Subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve
until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Each of such entity in China is also required to further set aside a portion
of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion
of its board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate
future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except
in the event of liquidation.
14
The
PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC.
Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency
for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our PRC Subsidiaries incur debt on their own in the future, the
instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments.
Cash
dividends, if any, on our common stock will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes,
any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding
tax at a rate of up to 10.0%.
In
order for us to pay dividends to our shareholders, we will rely on the distribution of dividends, through the WFOE, to Yingxi HK from
our PRC Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, none of our PRC Subsidiaries has distributed any dividends to Yingxi HK.
Pursuant
to the Arrangement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and
Tax Evasion on Income, or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, the 10% withholding tax rate may be lowered to 5% if a Hong Kong
resident enterprise owns no less than 25% of a PRC enterprise. However, the 5% withholding tax rate does not automatically apply and
certain requirements must be satisfied, including without limitation that (a) the Hong Kong enterprise must be the beneficial owner
of the relevant dividends; and (b) the Hong Kong enterprise must directly hold no less than 25% share ownership in the PRC enterprise
during the 12 consecutive months preceding its receipt of the dividends. In current practice, a Hong Kong enterprise must obtain a tax
resident certificate from the Hong Kong tax authority to apply for the 5% lower PRC withholding tax rate. As the Hong Kong tax
authority will issue such a tax resident certificate on a case-by-case basis, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain
the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority and enjoy the preferential withholding tax rate of 5% under
the Double Taxation Arrangement with respect to dividends to be paid by our WFOE to its immediate holding company, Yingxi HK. As of
the date of this Form 10-K, we have not applied for the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority.
Yingxi HK intends to apply for the tax resident certificate when WFOE plans to declare and pay dividends to Yingxi HK.
As
of the date hereof, we have had no transactions that involved the transfer of cash or assets throughout our corporate structure. The
PRC Subsidiaries have not transferred cash or other assets to Addentax, including by way of dividends. However, to the extent cash in
the business is in the PRC/Hong Kong or is in our PRC or Hong Kong subsidiaries, there can be no assurance that the PRC government will
not intervene or impose restrictions or limitations on the ability of Addentax or Addentax’s subsidiaries to transfer cash. As
a result, such funds may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside of the PRC or Hong Kong. Addentax does not currently
plan or anticipate transferring cash or other assets from our operations in China to any non-Chinese entity. We intend to retain most,
if not all, of available funds and any future earnings after this offering to the development and growth of our business in China. As
of the date hereof, no transfers, dividends, or distributions have been made to our investors. Further, our management is directly supervising
cash management. Our finance department is responsible for establishing the cash management policies and procedures among our departments
and the operating entities. Each department or operating entity initiates a cash request by putting forward a cash demand plan, which
explains the specific amount and timing of cash requested, and submitting it to designated management members of our Company, based on
the amount and the use of cash requested. The designated management member examines and approves the allocation of cash based on the
sources of cash and the priorities of the needs, and submits it to the cashier specialists of our finance department for a second review.
Other than the above, we currently do not have other cash management policies or procedures that dictate how funds are transferred nor
a written policy that addresses how we will handle any limitations on cash transfers due to PRC law.
Holding
Foreign Company Accountable Act
Trading
in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or investigate completely our auditor.
Pursuant
to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report on December 16, 2021 which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate
completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in: (1) mainland China of the People’s Republic of China because of
a position taken by one or more authorities in mainland China; and (2) Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the
PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong. In addition, the PCAOB’s report identified the specific
registered public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations.
The
PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections in China without the approval of Chinese government authorities. If it is later determined
that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection.
Any audit reports not issued by auditors that are completely inspected by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken
in China that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditors’ audits and their quality control procedures, could result
in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and disclosures are adequate and accurate.
15
Our
auditor, Pan-China Singapore PAC, the independent registered public accounting firm that issued the audit report included in this
Form 10-K, is subject to PCAOB inspections. Pan-China Singapore PAC is headquartered in Singapore and there are no limitations in
Singapore on PCAOB inspections. Therefore, we believe that, as of the date of this Form 10-K, our auditor is not subject to the
determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021 relating to the PCAOB’s inability to inspect or investigate
completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in the PRC or Hong Kong because of a position taken by one or more
authorities in the PRC or Hong Kong. However, to the extent that our auditor’s work papers may, in the future, become located
in China, such work papers will not be subject to inspection by the PCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct
inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities. Inspections of certain other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside
of China have identified deficiencies in those firms’ audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed
as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of our
auditors’ work papers in China would make it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor’s audit
procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections. As a
result, our investors may be deprived of the benefits of the PCAOB’s oversight of our auditor through such inspections and
they may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements. We cannot
assure you whether Nasdaq or other regulatory authorities will apply additional or more stringent criteria to us. Such uncertainty
could cause the market price of our Common Stock to be materially and adversely affected.
On
August 26, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it had signed the “Protocol” with the CSRC and the MOF, which governs inspections
and investigations of audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong. The Protocol remains unpublished and is subject to further explanation
and implementation. Pursuant to the fact sheet with respect to the Protocol released by the SEC, the PCAOB shall have independent discretion
to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and the unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC. According
to the PCAOB, its December 2021 determinations under the HFCAA remain in effect. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it has
completed a test inspection of two selected auditing firms in mainland China and Hong Kong and has voted to vacate its previous Determination
Report, which concluded in December 2021 that the PCAOB could not inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms
based in mainland China or Hong Kong. On December 23, 2022, the AHFCAA was enacted, which amended the HFCAA by requiring the SEC to prohibit
an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive
years instead of three and such act was signed into law on December 29, 2022. It is possible that the PCAOB may reassess its determinations
in the future, and it could determine that it is still unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms
in mainland China and Hong Kong. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and related regulations currently previously did not affect
the Company as the Company’s auditor is subject to PCAOB’s inspections and investigations.
Moreover,
if trading in our securities is prohibited under the HFCAA in the future because the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully
investigate our auditor at such a future time, an exchange may determine to delist our securities.
Furthermore,
on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed AHFCAA and on December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law by
President Biden, which contained, among other things, an identical provision to AHFCAA and amended the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable
Act by requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject
to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time before your securities may be prohibited from
trading or delisted. The delisting or the cessation of trading of our Common Stock, or the threat of their being delisted or prohibited
from being traded, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment. The PCAOB continues to demand complete access in
mainland China and Hong Kong moving forward and has resumed regular inspections since March 2023. Moreover, if trading in our securities
is prohibited under the HFCAA in the future because the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor at such
future time, an exchange may determine to delist our securities.

Item
1A. Risk Factors
You
should carefully consider the risks described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which could materially and adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be
the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may materially affect
our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If any of these risks occur, the trading price of our common stock could
decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the challenges we
face, including the ones discussed in this section. In the event that any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, it
could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flow and cause the value of our securities to decline in value or become
worthless.
Risks
Associated with Our Company
Our
success depends on our customers’ ability to market and sell their products manufactured by us.
All
of our customers in our garment manufacturing business are garment wholesalers and retailers. Consequently, our business and results
of operations are directly affected by the demand of their end customers for their products supplied by us. Drastic changes in consumer
preferences are beyond our control and will affect the demand for certain products supplied by us. We may not be able to anticipate and
respond to such changes in consumer preferences in a timely manner. If the sales of our customers’ products decrease or do not
grow as we expect, our customers may decrease the volume or purchase price of their orders, which could materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our
future expansion plans are subject to uncertainties and risks.
We
have set out our future business plans in the “Business Strategies” section in this report. The implementation of such future
plans requires us to effectively manage our sales, procurement, new logistics points and other aspects of our operations. If we fail
to effectively and efficiently implement our future plans, we may not be successful in achieving desirable and profitable results. Even
if we effectively and efficiently implement our future plans, there may be other unexpected events or factors that prevent us from achieving
the desirable and profitable results from the implementation of our future plans, such as changes in our ability to comply with local
rules and regulations or any delays or difficulties in obtaining the necessary licenses and approvals from local governments. Our business,
financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected if our future expansion plans
fail to achieve positive results.
17
If
we are unable to create brand influence, we may face difficulties in attracting new business partners and clients.
Our
brand is still being nurtured. It is of critical importance that we create and develop brand awareness in our industry in order to attract
new clients and business partners. Our major competitors have built well-known brands and continue to increase their influence. Our failure
to create and develop brand awareness for any reason may result in a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, and
financial position.
Our
ability to adequately protect our trade names, trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate
new markets.
We
believe that our trade names, trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy. We have applied the
registration of these trade names, trademarks and patents in China and Hong Kong, and these registrations are currently pending approval
from the corresponding departments. There can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain
will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. In particular, the laws of
certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If any third-party copies our
products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, it could have a material adverse effect
on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
We
may be impacted by our ability to adequately source, distribute and sell merchandise and other materials in China.
We
face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in China. For example:
●
political
instability, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters which could negatively affect international economies,
financial markets and business activity;
●
imposition
of new or retaliatory trade duties, sanctions or taxes and other charges on imports or exports;
●
evolving,
new or complex legal and regulatory matters;
●
volatility
in currency exchange rates;
●
local
business practice and political issues (including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards) which
may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts;
●
potential
delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts;
●
disruption
due to labor disputes; and
●
changing
expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation or other factors.
We
also rely upon third-party transportation providers for certain of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution
centers to our customers. Our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in labor
costs and fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and associate strikes and inclement weather, which may impact our transportation
providers’ ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs.
Future
price increases in raw materials or changes in the supply of raw materials may materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
The
purchase of raw materials accounted for a substantial amount of our total purchases. The price of finished fabric and yarns can be volatile
and affected by factors such as weather, industry demand and supply. We cannot assure you that we can fully pass on the increased cost
in raw materials to our customers. Future price increases in raw materials or changes in the supply of raw materials may materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
18
Our
top customers accounted for a major portion of our total revenue for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 and may materially adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations.
For the year ended March 31, 2025,
one customer accounted for approximately 54.1% of the Company’s total garment manufacturing revenues. For the year ended March 31,
2024, two customers accounted for approximately 73.9% and 22.1%, respectively, of the Company’s total garment manufacturing revenues.
For the year ended March 31, 2025, two customers accounted for approximately 16.7% and 14.3% of the Company’s total logistic services
revenues. For the year ended March 31, 2024, one customer accounted for approximately 20.0% of the Company’s total logistic services
revenues. However, our top customers are not obligated in any way to continue to provide us with new business in the future at a level
similar to that in the past or at all. If any of our top customers reduce their orders with us or terminate their business relationship
with our Group and if we are not able to secure orders of a comparable size from other customers as replacement, our business operations
and financial performance may be materially and adversely affected.
We
are exposed to concentration risk due to heavy reliance on our major supplier for the supply of our products, and any shortage of, or delay
in, the supply may significantly impact our business and results of operation.
During the years ended March 31,
2025 and 2024, approximately 41.39% and 100.0% of total inventory purchases were from the Company’s five largest suppliers, respectively.
Our business, financial condition and operating results depend on the continuous supply of products from our largest suppliers and our
continuous supplier-customer relationship with them. Our heavy reliance on our largest suppliers for the supply of our products will have
significant impact on our business and results of operation in the event of any shortage of, or delay in the supply.
Any
labor shortages, increased labor costs or other factors affecting labor supply for our production materials may materially and adversely
affect our business operations.
We
rely on skilled workers to a significant extent as our production process in our garment manufacturing business is labor intensive in
nature. Our business performance relies on the steady supply of relatively low cost labor in the PRC. There is no guarantee that our
supply of labor will not be disrupted or that our labor costs will not increase. If we fail to retain our existing labor resources and/or
recruit sufficient labor in a timely manner, we may not be able to accommodate sudden increases in demand for our products.
Labor
costs are affected by the demand for and supply of labor and economic factors, such as the inflation rate and costs of living. Labor
costs may further increase in the future due to a shortage of skilled labor and growing industry demands. The failure to identify and
recruit replacement staff immediately following the unexpected loss of skilled workers could reduce our competitiveness. In addition,
we expect continued increases in labor costs in the PRC. In these circumstances, our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.
We
may be impacted by our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified associates and manage labor-related costs.
We
believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each customer, which requires us to
have highly trained and engaged associates. Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient
number of qualified associates, including skill intensive labor. The turnover rate in the textile industry is generally high, and qualified
individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in our operations. Competition
for such qualified individuals or changes in labor laws could require us to incur higher labor costs. Our inability to recruit a sufficient
number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned delivery of finished products or affect the speed with which we expand.
Delayed deliveries, significant increases in associate turnover rates or significant increases in labor-related costs could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
We
may be impacted by our vendors’ ability to manufacture and deliver raw materials in a timely manner, meet quality standards and
comply with applicable laws and regulations.
We
purchase raw materials from third-party vendors. Factors outside our control, such as production or shipping delays or quality problems,
could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns.
In
addition, quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our
sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competition reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if
the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely
impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image.
Our
business could also suffer if our third-party vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. While our internal and vendor’s
operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our associates visit and monitor the operations of our third-party vendors,
we do not control these vendors or their practices. The violation of labor, environmental or other laws by third-party vendors used by
us, or the divergence of a third-party vendor’s or partner’s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted
as ethical or appropriate, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation.
19
Large
and similar sized competitors could steal our market share by offering lower prices.
We
endeavor to provide the highest possible quality service to our clients at the best possible price, however, large and similar sized
competitors might steal some of our market share by offering lower prices, causing us to lose some of our clients. If this happens, we
might not be able to generate adequate revenues and may soon find ourselves lacking the capital that is required to continue operations.
If
we are unable to attract additional customers and clients to purchase our services (and future products we may develop or sell), it will
have a negative effect on our ability to generate the revenue.
We
currently have a limited number of clients and customers. We have identified additional potential clients, but we cannot guarantee that
we will be able to secure them as clients. Even if we obtain additional clients and customers, there is no guarantee that we will be
able develop products and/or services that our clients and customers will want to purchase. If we are unable to attract enough customers
and clients to purchase services (and any products we may develop or sell) it will have a negative effect on our ability to generate
the revenue that is necessary to operate or expand our business. The lack of sufficient revenue will have a negative effect on the ability
of our company to continue operations and could force us to cease operations.
We
may be adversely affected by the performance of third-party contractors.
We
engage third-party contractors to carry out logistics services. We endeavor to engage third-party companies with a strong reputation
and track record, high performance reliability and adequate financial resources. However, any such third-party contractor may still fail
to provide satisfactory logistics services at a level of quality or within the timeframe required by us or our customers. While we generally
require our logistics contractors to fully reimburse us for any losses arising from delay in delivery or non-delivery, our results of
operation and financial condition may be adversely affected if any of the losses are not borne by them. If the performance of any third-party
contractor is not satisfactory, we may need to replace such contractor or take other remedial actions, which could adversely affect the
cost structure and delivery schedule of our products and thus have a negative impact on our reputation, financial position and business
operations. In addition, as we are expanding our business into other geographical locations in the PRC, there may be a shortage of third-party
contractors that meet our quality standards and other selection criteria in such locations and, as a result, we may not be able to engage
a sufficient number of high-quality third-party contractors in a timely manner, which may adversely affect our delivery schedules and
delivery costs and hence our business, results of operations and financial conditions.
We
may be exposed to concentration risk due to heavy reliance on third-party contractors for our logistic business, and any shortage of third-party
contractors may significantly impact our business and results of operation.
The
Company relied on a few subcontractors for our logistic business, in which the subcontracting fees to our largest contractor
represented approximately 5.2% and 42.0% of total cost of revenues for our logistics service segment for the years ended March 31,
2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease in subcontracting fee to the largest contractor was mainly due to decrease use of subcontractors. We have not experienced any disputes with our subcontractors, and we believe we maintain good relationships with
our contract logistic service provider.
If
we are unable to control the reliance of third-party contractors efficiently and effectively, our business prospects and results of operations
may be materially and adversely affected.
We
engaged subcontractors to carry out logistics services. Subcontracting fees for our logistics business for the year ended March 31, 2025
decreased to approximately $0.2 million from $1.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2024, representing an decrease of approximately
89.0%. Subcontracting fees accounted for 5.5% and 34.9% of our total logistics business revenue in the years ended March 31, 2025 and
2024, respectively.
If
we are unable to control the reliance of subcontractors efficiently and effectively, our business prospects and results of operations
may be materially and adversely affected.
20
Our
insurance may not be sufficient.
We
carry insurance that we consider adequate in regard to the nature of the covered risks and the costs of coverage. We are not fully insured
against all possible risks, nor are all such risks insurable.
Competition
for tenants could impact our occupancy rates.
Our
property management and subleasing operations face significant competition for tenants within the garment market. Competitive factors
include rental rates, property location, lease terms, and the quality of properties offered. We compete directly with other landlords
and property operators offering similar leasing opportunities in our targeted areas. The presence of newer or better-located properties
could adversely affect our ability to attract tenants and the rental rates we can achieve.
Our
performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants, including anchor tenants, our tenants’ financial condition and
our tenants maintaining leases for our properties.
Our
property management and subleasing operations rely heavily on our ability to collect rent from tenants, including anchor tenants, to
maintain financial stability. The financial condition of our tenants directly impacts their ability to meet lease obligations. Economic
downturns or adverse market conditions, such as inflation, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and changes in consumer spending
habits, may weaken tenants’ financial positions. This could lead to delays in lease commencements, non-renewals, or defaults on
rental payments. In some cases, tenants may choose to close stores or declare bankruptcy, resulting in the termination of leases and
loss of rental income. Enforcing lease terms in case of default may incur delays and costs, potentially affecting our cash flow and financial
performance.
A
tenant filing for bankruptcy protection could prevent us from collecting pre-bankruptcy debts or recovering losses related to unpaid
rent or damages. The rejection of leases in bankruptcy proceedings would leave us with general unsecured claims, likely resulting in
partial or no recovery of outstanding balances. Multiple lease terminations or failures of tenants to occupy premises could lead to lease
terminations or reduced rents for remaining tenants under certain lease terms. In such scenarios, re-leasing vacant spaces at competitive
rates may be challenging, potentially reducing overall rental income and impacting financial results. The occurrence of these situations,
particularly involving significant tenants with leases across multiple locations, could materially affect our financial condition, operational
results, and cash flow.
Subleasing
to smaller and growth-oriented businesses could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.
A
portion of our tenant base consists of smaller, growth-oriented businesses in the garment industry. These tenants may have less financial
stability compared to larger corporations, increasing the risk of tenant defaults, turnover, or bankruptcies. Smaller businesses are
more susceptible to economic downturns or changes in market conditions, which could lead to challenges in rent payments, lease renewals,
or the need for alternative office spaces. Such tenant-related risks could impact our cash flow and financial performance.
21
Our
business depends on the continued contributions made by Mr. Hong Zhida, as our key executive officer, the loss of whom may result in
a severe impediment to our business.
Our
success is dependent upon the continued contributions made by our CEO and President, Mr. Hong Zhida. We rely on his expertise in business
operations when we are developing new products and services. The Company has no “Key Man” insurance to cover the resulting
losses in the event that any of our officer or directors should die or resign.
If
Mr. Hong Zhida cannot serve the Company or is no longer willing to do so, the Company may not be able to find alternatives in a timely
manner or at all. This would likely result in severe damage to our business operations and would have an adverse material impact on our
financial position and operational results. To continue as a viable operation, the Company may have to recruit and train replacement
personnel at a higher cost.
Additionally,
if Mr. Hong Zhida joins our competitors or develops similar businesses that are in competition with our Company, our business may also
be negatively impacted.
Our
future success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified long-term staff to fill management, technology, sales, marketing,
and customer services positions. We have a great need for qualified talent, but we may not be successful in attracting, hiring, developing,
and retaining the talent required for our success.
We
may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters.
We,
along with third parties we do business with, are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. Actions filed against us from time
to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption
and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. The cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate
resolution of such claims, whether by settlement or adverse court decision, may harm our business. Further, potential claimants may be
encouraged to bring lawsuits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us. We cannot currently assess the likely
outcome of such suits, but if the outcome were negative, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.
In
addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, that could have
a material adverse effect on our reputation, the market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows.
Unauthorized
disclosure, destruction or modification of data, through cybersecurity breaches, computer viruses or otherwise or disruption of our services
could expose us to liability, protracted and costly litigation and damage our reputation.
Our
business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers’ business data. An increasing number of organizations,
including large merchants and businesses, other large technology companies, financial institutions and government institutions, have
disclosed breaches of their information technology, or IT, systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted cybersecurity
attacks, including on portions of their websites or infrastructure. We may also be subjected to breaches of cybersecurity by hackers.
Threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological
failure. Concerns about cybersecurity are increased when we transmit information. Electronic transmissions can also be subjected to cybersecurity
attacks, interception or loss. Also, computer viruses and malware can be distributed and spread rapidly over the internet and could infiltrate
our systems or those of our associated participants, which can impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information,
and the integrity and availability of our products, services and systems, among other effects. Denial of service or other cybersecurity
attacks could be targeted against us for a variety of purposes, including interfering with our products and services or creating a diversion
for other malicious activities. These types of actions and attacks could disrupt our delivery of products and services or make them unavailable,
which could damage our reputation, force us to incur significant expenses in remediating the resulting impacts, expose us to uninsured
liabilities, subject us to lawsuits, fines or sanctions, distract our management or increase our costs of doing business.
22
Our
encryption of data and other protective measures may not prevent unauthorized access or use of sensitive data. A breach of our system
or that of one of our associated participants may subject us to material losses or liability. A misuse of such data or a cybersecurity
breach could harm our reputation and deter customers from using our products and services, thus reducing our revenue. In addition, any
such misuse or breach could cause us to incur costs to correct the breaches or failures, expose us to uninsured liabilities, increase
our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits, result in the imposition of material penalties and fines under applying laws
or regulations.
We
cannot assure that there are written agreements in place with every associated participant or that such written agreements will prevent
the unauthorized use, modification, destruction or disclosure of data or enable us or our customers to obtain reimbursement in the event
we should suffer incidents resulting in unauthorized use, modification, destruction or disclosure of data. Any unauthorized use, modification,
destruction or disclosure of data could result in protracted and costly litigation, which could have a material and adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Cybersecurity
attack incidents are increasing in frequency and evolving in nature and include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software,
unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of
confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope
of information technology disruptions, there can be no assurance that the procedures and controls we employ will be sufficient to prevent
security breaches from occurring and we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses
from remedial actions, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Failure
to make adequate contributions to various employee benefits plans as required by PRC regulations may subject us to penalties.
Companies
operating in China are required to participate in various government sponsored employee benefit plans, including certain social insurance,
housing funds and other welfare-oriented payment obligations, and contribute to the plans in amounts equal to certain percentages of
salaries, including bonuses and allowances, of employees up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time at
locations where they operate their businesses. The requirement of employee benefit plans has not been implemented consistently by the
local governments in China given the different levels of economic development in different locations. As of March 31, 2025, we have made
adequate employee benefit payments in strict compliance with the relevant PRC regulations for and on behalf of our employees.
There
is no guarantee that we will not fail in making adequate employee benefit payments in strict compliance with applicable PRC labor related
laws and regulations in the future. Our failure in making contributions to various employee benefits plans in strict compliance with
applicable PRC labor related laws and regulations may subject us to late payment penalties, and we could also be required to make up
the contributions for these plans as well as to pay late fees and fines. If we are subject to late fees or fines in relation to the underpaid
employee benefits, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
23
A
recent joint statement by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or the “PCAOB,” proposed
rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the newly enacted “Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act” all call for additional
and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially
the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB. These developments could add uncertainties to investing in us.
On
April 21, 2020, the SEC and the PCAOB released a joint statement highlighting the risks associated with investing in companies based
in or having substantial operations in emerging markets including China. The joint statement emphasized the risks associated with lack
of access for the PCAOB to inspect auditors and audit work papers in China and higher risks of fraud in emerging markets.
On
May 18, 2020, Nasdaq filed three proposals with the SEC to (i) apply a minimum offering size requirement for companies primarily operating
in a “Restrictive Market,” (ii) adopt a new requirement relating to the qualification of management or the board of directors
for Restrictive Market companies, and (iii) apply additional and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the
qualifications of the company’s auditor.
On
December 18, 2020, the “Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act” was signed by previous President of the United States
and became law. This legislation requires certain issuers of securities to establish that they are not owned or controlled by a foreign
government. Specifically, an issuer must make this certification if the PCAOB is unable to audit specified reports because the issuer
has retained a foreign public accounting firm not subject to inspection by the PCAOB. Furthermore, if the PCAOB is unable to inspect
the issuer’s public accounting firm for three consecutive years, the issuer’s securities are banned from trading on a national
exchange or through other methods.
On
March 24, 2021, the SEC announced that it had adopted interim final amendments to implement congressionally mandated submission and disclosure
requirements of the HFCAA. The interim final amendments will apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report
on Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-F or N-CSR with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction
and that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that
jurisdiction. The SEC will implement a process for identifying such a registrant and any such identified registrant will be required
to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in that foreign jurisdiction,
and will also require disclosure in the registrant’s annual report regarding the audit arrangements of, and governmental influence
on, such a registrant.
Furthermore,
on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“AHFCAA”), which, if
enacted, would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges
if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three. If the AHFCAA is enacted, and if we are
subject to it, it would decrease the number of “non-inspection years” from three years to two years, and thus, would reduce
the time before our securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted.
On
September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted rules to create a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCAA,
whether it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because
of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction.
On
December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize the interim final rules previously adopted in March 2021 to implement the submission
and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an Form 10-K with
an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable
to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction.
On
December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely
registered public accounting firms headquartered in: (1) mainland China of the People’s Republic of China, because of a position
taken by one or more authorities in mainland China; and (2) Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because
of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong. The PCAOB has made such designations as mandated under the HFCAA. Pursuant
to each annual determination by the PCAOB, the SEC will, on an annual basis, identify issuers that have used non-inspected audit firms
and thus are at risk of such suspensions in the future.
24
The
PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections in China without the approval of Chinese government authorities. If it is later determined
that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection.
Any audit reports not issued by auditors that are completely inspected by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken
in China that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditors’ audits and their quality control procedures, could result
in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and disclosures are adequate and accurate.
Our
auditor, Pan-China Singapore PAC, the independent registered public accounting firm that issued the audit report included in this
Form 10-K, is subject to PCAOB inspections. Pan-China Singapore PAC is headquartered in Singapore and there are no limitations in
Singapore on PCAOB inspections. Therefore, we believe that, as of the date of this Annual Report, our auditor is not subject to the
determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021 relating to the PCAOB’s inability to inspect or investigate
completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in the PRC or Hong Kong because of a position taken by one or more
authorities in the PRC or Hong Kong. However, to the extent that our auditor’s work papers may, in the future, become located
in China, such work papers will not be subject to inspection by the PCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct
inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities. Inspections of certain other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside
of China have identified deficiencies in those firms’ audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed
as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of our
auditors’ work papers in China would make it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor’s audit
procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections. As a
result, our investors may be deprived of the benefits of the PCAOB’s oversight of our auditor through such inspections and
they may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements. We cannot
assure you whether Nasdaq or other regulatory authorities will apply additional or more stringent criteria to us. Such uncertainty
could cause the market price of our Common Stock to be materially and adversely affected.
There
are uncertainties under the PRC Securities Law relating to the procedures and requisite timing for the U.S. securities regulatory agencies
to conduct investigations and collect evidence within the territory of the PRC.
On
December 28, 2019, the newly amended Securities Law of the PRC (the “PRC Securities Law”) was promulgated, which became effective
on March 1, 2020. According to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law (“Article 177”), the securities regulatory authority
of the State Council may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with securities regulatory authorities of another country or region
for the implementation of cross-border supervision and administration. Article 177 further provides that overseas securities regulatory
authorities shall not engage in activities pertaining to investigations or evidence collection directly conducted within the territories
of the PRC, and that no Chinese entities or individuals shall provide documents and information in connection with securities business
activities to any organizations and/or persons aboard without the prior consent of the securities regulatory authority of the State Council
and the competent departments of the State Council. As
of the date of this Form 10-K, we are not aware of any implementing rules or regulations which have been published regarding application
of Article 177.
As
advised by our PRC counsel, Article 177 is only applicable where the activities of overseas authorities constitute a direct investigation
or evidence collection by such authorities within the territory of the PRC. Our principal business operation is conducted in the PRC.
In the event that the U.S. securities regulatory agencies carry out an investigation on us such as an enforcement action by the Department
of Justice, the SEC or other authorities, such agencies’ activities will constitute conducting an investigation or collecting evidence
directly within the territory of the PRC and accordingly fall within the scope of Article 177. In that case, the U.S. securities regulatory
agencies may have to consider establishing cross-border cooperation with the securities regulatory authority of the PRC by way of judicial
assistance, diplomatic channels or establishing a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authority of the PRC.
However, there is no assurance that the U.S. securities regulatory agencies will succeed in establishing such cross-border cooperation
in this particular case and/or establish such cooperation in a timely manner.
25
Furthermore,
as Article 177 is a recently promulgated provision and, as the date of this Form 10-K, there have not been implementing rules or
regulations regarding the application of Article 177, so it remains unclear as to how it will be interpreted, implemented or applied
by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission or other relevant government authorities. As such, there are uncertainties as to the
procedures and requisite timing for the U.S. securities regulatory agencies to conduct investigations and collect evidence within
the territory of the PRC. If the U.S. securities regulatory agencies are unable to conduct such investigations, there exists a risk
that they may determine to suspend or de-register our registration with the SEC and may also delist our securities from Nasdaq or
other applicable trading market within the US.
We
are exposed to liabilities relating to environmental protection and safety laws and regulations.
Our
operations are subject to comprehensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health
and safety. The discharge of waste and pollutants from our manufacturing operations into the environment may give rise to liabilities
that may require us to incur costs to remedy such discharge. If we violate such laws or regulations, we may be required to implement
corrective actions and could be subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions.
However,
we cannot assure you that any environmental laws adopted in the future will not materially increase our operating costs and other expenses.
We cannot assure you that we will not have to make significant capital or operating expenditures in the future in order to comply with
existing or new laws and regulations or that we will comply with applicable environmental laws at all times. Such violations or liability
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If
our employees do not maintain a strong work ethic and comply with our code of ethics, including our confidentiality requirements, their
actions may negatively influence our business and reputation.
Employees
with good professional ethics are important for any company’s development. An employee might, either intentionally or unintentionally,
disclose confidential information about our Company or our clients and particularly unscrupulous employees might endeavor to sell material
information to industry competitors. Furthermore, our employees will develop relationships with our business partners and clients, and
may acquire information that could be used to harm their business interests. If this should happen, our partners and clients might lose
faith in our company. While we can never eliminate these ethical risks entirely, we will attempt to reduce the likelihood of breaches
of trust and mitigate their impacts of it by hiring highly professional employees and establishing strong internal information management
systems.
We
also plan to establish a series of policies to reduce the likelihood of such events.
However,
in the event that any employee discloses confidential information about our Company or our clients or sells material information to industry
competitors, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operations and cash flow.
We
face risks associated with future Chinese regulations.
Currently
there are no government regulations in China regarding our type of services. The Chinese government encourages small-medium sized traditional
industry companies to conduct business model transformation and technology updates, which may help companies gain more competitive advantages
in international markets.
Other
than the required adherence to general business laws and regulatory disclosures, our services are not affected by any specific additional
Chinese government regulations. However, this does not preclude the possibility that China may institute regulations that will make it
difficult or impossible for us to operate successfully, if at all, in the future. If that occurs, we may have to focus our business on
companies located outside China. This could cause our results of operations to be materially adversely affected, reduce our revenues
and cause the value of our securities to decline in value.
26
We
may require additional financing in the future and our operations could be curtailed if we are unable to obtain required additional financing
when needed.
We
may need to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund future capital expenditures. While we do not anticipate seeking additional
financing in the immediate future, any additional equity may result in dilution to the holders of our outstanding shares of capital stock.
Additional debt financing may include conditions that would restrict our freedom to operate our business, such as conditions that:
●
limit
our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek consent for the payment of dividends;
●
increase
our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
●
require
us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash
flow to fund capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes; and
●
limit
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.
We
cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
Natural
disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us.
Natural
disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy,
and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power
shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. This may result in delivery delays, malfunctioning of facilities or shutdown
of logistic points. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our products and services to our customers and
could decrease demand for our services. In the past, there was no significant disruption of operation at our production facilities and
logistic points. However, we cannnot assure you that the production facilities and logistic points will always operate normally in
the future.
We
are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth
companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.
We
are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various
reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including not
being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding
advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot
predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common
stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.
27
General
Risks Associated with Business Operations in China
The
PRC government may intervene or influence our business operations at any time or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas
and foreign investment in China based issuers, which could result in a material change in our business operations and/or the value of
our securities. Additionally, the governmental and regulatory interference could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability
to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.
Recent
statements by the Chinese government have indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas
and/or foreign investments in China-based issuers. For example, the PRC has proposed new rules that would require companies collecting
or holding large amounts of data to undergo a cybersecurity review prior to listing in foreign countries, a move that would significantly
tighten oversight over China based internet giants. The Cybersecurity Review Measures that took effect from February 15, 2022 stipulate
that an internet platform operator who possesses more than 1 million users’ personal information must report to the Office of Cybersecurity
Review for a cybersecurity review when seeking listings in other nations.
On
April 2, 2022, the CSRC released the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Offering
and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments), which provide that a domestic company that seeks to offer and list its securities
in a overseas market shall strictly abide by applicable PRC laws and regulations, enhance legal awareness of keeping state secrets and
strengthening archives administration, institute a sound confidentiality and archives administration system, and take necessary measures
to fulfill confidentiality and archives administration obligations. In the event that the above proposed provisions and rules are enacted,
the relevant filing procedures of the CSRC and other governmental authorities may be required in connection with this offering. On July
7, 2022, CAC promulgated the Measures for the Security Assessment of Data Cross-border Transfer, effective on September 1, 2022, which
requires the data processors to apply for data cross-border security assessment coordinated by the CAC under the following circumstances:
(i) any data processor transfers important data to overseas; (ii) any critical information infrastructure operator or data processor
who processes personal information of over 1 million people provides personal information to overseas; (iii) any data processor who provides
personal information to overseas and has already provided personal information of more than 100,000 people or sensitive personal information
of more than 10,000 people to overseas since January 1st of the previous year; and (iv) other circumstances under which the data cross-border
transfer security assessment is required as prescribed by the CAC.
Since
the majority of our operations are located in the PRC, our business may be subject to PRC laws relating to the collection, use, sharing,
retention, security, and transfer of confidential and private information, such as personal information and other data. As of the date
of this Form 10K, these new laws and guidelines have not impacted the Company’s ability to conduct its business, accept foreign
investments, or list and trade on a U.S. or other foreign exchange. The business of our subsidiaries until this Form 10K are not subject
to cybersecurity review with the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, given that: (i) our products and services are offered not
directly to individual users but through our institutional customers; (ii) we do not possess a large amount of personal information in
our business operations; and (iii) data processed in our business does not have a bearing on national security and thus may not be classified
as core or important data by the authorities. Further, we believe our newly established companies and our business plan will not change
the above conclusion. However, there remains uncertainty as to how the Cybersecurity Review Measures will be interpreted or implemented
and whether the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, may adopt new laws, regulations, rules, or detailed implementation and interpretation
related to the Cybersecurity Review Measures. If any such new laws, regulations, rules, or implementation and interpretation comes into
effect, we will take all reasonable measures and actions to comply and to minimize the adverse effect of such laws on us. Any non-compliance
could result in penalties or other significant legal liabilities.
28
We
cannot assure you that PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, would take the same view as we do, and there is no assurance that
we can fully or timely comply with such laws. In the event that we are subject to any mandatory cybersecurity review and other specific
actions required by the CAC, we face uncertainty as to whether any clearance or other required actions can be timely completed, or at
all. Given such uncertainty, we may be further required to suspend our relevant business, shut down our website, or face other penalties,
which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any future action by the PRC
government and companies whose foreign securities offerings are subject to review by the CSRC or the CAC could significantly limit or
completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and could cause the value of such securities to significantly
decline or be worthless.
Our
independent registered public accounting firm’s audit documentation related to their audit reports included in this Form 10-K
include audit documentation located in the PRC. Our Common Stocks may be delisted or prohibited from being traded over-the-counter under
the HFCAA if the PCAOB is unable to inspect our audit documentation located in mainland China and, as such, you may be deprived of the
benefits of such inspection which could result in limitations or restrictions to our access to the U.S. capital markets. The delisting
or the cessation of trading of our Common Stocks, or the threat of their being delisted or prohibited from being traded, may materially
and adversely affect the value of your investment.
Our
independent registered public accounting firm issued an audit opinion on the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025. As an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered
with the PCAOB, our auditor is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB.
Our
auditor is headquartered in Singapore and there are no limitations in Singapore on PCAOB inspections.
However, recent developments with respect to audits of PRC and Hong Kong based companies, such as us, create uncertainty about the ability
of our auditor to fully cooperate with the PCAOB’s request for audit workpapers without the approval of the Chinese authorities.
As a result, our investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB’s oversight of our auditors through such inspections.
Inspections
of certain other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms’ audit procedures
and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The PCAOB is
currently able to conduct inspections of audit firms located in mainland China and Hong Kong and conduct inspections of U.S. audit firms
where audit work papers are located in mainland China. The audit workpapers for our PRC operations are located in the PRC.
In
addition, as part of a continued regulatory focus in the United States on access to audit and other information currently protected by
national law, in particular China’s, in June 2019, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced bills in both houses of Congress
that would require the SEC to maintain a list of issuers for which the PCAOB is not able to inspect or investigate an auditor report
issued by a foreign public accounting firm. The Ensuring Quality Information and Transparency for Abroad-Based Listings on our Exchanges
(EQUITABLE) Act prescribes increased disclosure requirements for such issuers and, beginning in 2025, the delisting from national securities
exchanges such as Nasdaq of issuers included for three consecutive years on the SEC’s list. On May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed
S. 945, the HFCAA. The HFCAA was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives on December 2, 2020. On December 18, 2020, the former
U.S. president signed into law the HFCAA. In essence, the HFCAA requires the SEC to prohibit foreign companies from listing securities
on U.S. securities exchanges if a company retains a foreign accounting firm that cannot be inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive
years, beginning in 2021. The enactment of the HFCAA and any additional rulemaking efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit
information could cause investor uncertainty for affected issuers, including us, and the market price of our securities could be adversely
affected, and we could be delisted if it is unable to cure the situation to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time. On March 24,
2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the
HFCAA. We will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies it as having a “non-inspection” year under a
process to be subsequently established by the SEC. The SEC is assessing how to implement other requirements of the HFCAA, including the
listing and trading prohibition requirements described above.
29
Furthermore,
on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the AHFCAA and on December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into
law by President Biden, which contained, among other things, an identical provision to AHFCAA and amended the HFCAA by requiring the
SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB
inspections for two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time before your securities may be prohibited from trading
or delisted. On September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted a final rule implementing the HFCAA, which provides a framework for the PCAOB
to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCAA, whether the Board is unable to inspect or investigate completely
registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that
jurisdiction. On December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure
requirements in the HFCAA. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit
report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to
inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions.
On
December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA.
The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public
accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of
a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction.
On
December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered
public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong because of positions taken by mainland China and Hong Kong authorities
in those jurisdictions, and identifies the registered public accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong that are subject to such
determinations. The PCAOB has made such designations as mandated under the HFCAA. Pursuant to each annual determination by the PCAOB,
the SEC will, on an annual basis, identify issuers that have used non-inspected audit firms and thus are at risk of such suspensions
in the future. The auditor of the Company, Pan-China Singapore PAC, is not among the auditor firms listed on the determination list issued
by the PCAOB, which notes all of the auditor firms that the PCAOB is not able to inspect.
On
August 26, 2022, the CSRC, the Ministry of Finance of the PRC, and the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol, or the Protocol, governing
inspections and investigations of audit firms based in China and Hong Kong. The Protocol remains unpublished and is subject to further
explanation and implementation. Pursuant to the fact sheet with respect to the Protocol disclosed by the SEC, the PCAOB shall have independent
discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and has the unfettered ability to transfer information to the
SEC. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it has completed a test inspection of two selected auditing firms in mainland China
and Hong Kong and has voted to vacate its previous Determination Report, which concluded in December 2021 that the PCAOB could not inspect
or investigate completely registered public accounting firms based in mainland China or Hong Kong. On December 23, 2022, the AHFCAA was
enacted, which amended the HFCAA by requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges
if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three and such act was signed into law on December
29, 2022.
On
December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law by President Biden, which contained, among other things, an
identical provision to AHFCAA and amended the HFCAA by requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any
U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three.
30
The
PCAOB continues to demand complete access in mainland China and Hong Kong moving forward and has resumed regular inspections since March
2023. Should the PCAOB be unable to fully conduct inspections of our auditors’ work papers in the PRC, it will make it more difficult
to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor’s audit procedures or quality control procedures and you may be deprived of the benefits
of such inspection, which could result in limitation or restriction to our access to the U.S. capital markets, and our securities may
be delisted or prohibited from trading if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or investigate completely our auditor under the
HFCAA. Investors may consequently lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial
statements, which would adversely affect us.
To
the extent cash in the business is in the PRC or a PRC entity, the funds may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside
of the PRC due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the ability of our Company or our subsidiaries
by the PRC government to transfer cash.
Relevant
PRC laws and regulations permit the companies in the PRC to pay dividends only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined
in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, each of the companies in the PRC are required to set aside
at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered
capital. The companies in the PRC are also required to further set aside a portion of their after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare
fund, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at their discretion. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.
In order for us to pay dividends to our stockholders, we will rely on the distribution of dividends, through the WFOE, to Yingxi HK from
our PRC Subsidiaries.
Our
cash dividends, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a tax resident enterprise of the PRC for tax purposes, any
dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding
tax. See “Risk Factors – General Risks Associated with Business Operation in China - We may be treated as a resident enterprise
for PRC tax purposes under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, and we may therefore be subject to PRC income tax on our global income”
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
The
PRC government also imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency
out of the PRC. The majority of our income is received in RMB and shortages in foreign currencies may restrict our ability to pay dividends
or other payments, or otherwise satisfy our foreign currency denominated obligations, if any. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations,
payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions,
can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE as long as certain procedural requirements are met. Approval from
appropriate government authorities is required if RMB is converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the PRC to pay capital expenses
such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may, at its discretion, impose restrictions on access
to foreign currencies for current account transactions and if this occurs in the future, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign
currencies to our shareholders.
As
a result of the above, to the extent cash in the business is in the PRC or a PRC entity, such funds or assets may not be available to
fund operations or for other use outside of the PRC, due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the
ability of us, or our subsidiaries by the PRC government to transfer cash.
You
may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.
We
are a Nevada corporation and most of our assets are and will be located outside of the United States. Almost all of our operations will
be conducted in China. In addition, our officers and directors are nationals and residents of a country other than the United States.
All of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within
the United States upon them. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of
the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officer and director, since he is not a resident in the United States. In addition,
there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of China would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts.
Foreign
exchange fluctuations may affect our business.
We
accept the payment for services in Chinese Yuan (CNY or RMB), Hong Kong Dollars (HKD), and U.S. Dollars (USD). Therefore, foreign exchange
fluctuations may influence our business in unpredictable ways.
31
The
value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political
and economic conditions and the foreign exchange policy adopted by the PRC government. For instance, in August 2015, the People’s
Bank of China, or PBOC, changed the way it calculates the mid-point price of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, requiring the market-makers
who submit for reference rates to consider the previous day’s closing spot rate, foreign-exchange demand and supply as well as
changes in major currency rates. In 2016 and 2017, the value of the Renminbi depreciated approximately 7.2% and appreciated 6.3% against
the U.S. dollar, respectively. From April 2024 through the end of March 2025, the value of the Renminbi depreciated by approximately
1.2% against the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy, including any interest rate
increases by the Federal Reserve, may impact the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future. There remains
significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, including from the U.S. government,
which has threatened to label China as a “currency manipulator,” which could result in greater fluctuation of the Renminbi
against the U.S. dollar.
A
substantial percentage of our revenues and costs are denominated in Renminbi, and a significant portion of our assets are also denominated
in Renminbi. We are a holding company and we rely on dividends, loans and other distributions on equity paid by our operating subsidiaries
in China. Any significant fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi may materially and adversely affect our liquidity and cash flows.
Appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount we would receive. Conversely,
to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar
would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive.
Inflation
could pose a risk to our business.
Inflation
is an important factor that must be considered as we move forward. A change in the rate of inflation could influence the profits that
we generate from our business. When the rate of inflation rises, the operational costs of running our company would increase, such as
labor costs, raw materials and public utilities, affecting our ability to provide our services at competitive prices. An increase in
the rate of inflation would force our clients to search for other service providers, causing us to lose business and revenue.
Changes
in the policies, regulations, rules and the enforcement of laws of the PRC government may be quick with little advance notice and could
have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business.
The
PRC’s economy is in a transition from a planned economy to a market oriented economy subject to five-year and annual plans adopted
by the central government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on
the economic conditions of the PRC. The PRC government has confirmed that economic development will follow the model of a market economy.
Under this direction, we believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries
and business development in the PRC will follow market forces. While we believe that this trend will continue, we cannot assure you that
this will be the case. Changes in policies, regulations, rules and the enforcement of laws by the PRC government, which changes may be
quick with little advance notice, could adversely affect our interests by, among other factors: changes in laws, regulations or the interpretation
thereof, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies, or the expropriation or nationalization
of private enterprises. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, we cannot assure
you that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the
event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting the PRC’s political, economic
and social environment.
There
are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws, rules and regulations.
Most
of our operations are conducted in the PRC, and are governed by PRC laws, rules and regulations. Our PRC Subsidiaries are subject to
laws, rules and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes.
Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value.
32
In
1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws, rules and regulations governing economic matters in general.
The overall effect of legislation over the past four decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of
foreign investment in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws, rules and regulations
may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China or may be subject to significant degree of interpretation by PRC
regulatory agencies and courts. In particular, because these laws, rules and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited
number of published decisions and the non-precedential nature of these decisions, and because the laws, rules and regulations often give
the relevant regulator significant discretion in how to enforce them, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations
involve uncertainties and can be inconsistent and unpredictable. Therefore, it is possible that our existing operations may be found
not to be in full compliance with relevant laws and regulations in the future. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on
government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and which may have a retroactive
effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until after the occurrence of the violation.
Any
administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management
attention. Since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and
contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection
we enjoy than in more developed legal systems. These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into
and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
PRC
regulations regarding acquisitions impose significant regulatory approval and review requirements, which could make it more difficult
for us to pursue growth through acquisitions.
Under
the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law, companies undertaking acquisitions relating to businesses in China must notify the anti-monopoly enforcement
agency, in advance of any transaction where the parties’ revenues in the China market exceed certain thresholds and the buyer would
obtain control of, or decisive influence over, the other party. In addition, on August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including
the MOFCOM, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, the SAIC, the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, jointly adopted the Regulations
on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, which came into effect on September 8,
2006 and was amended on June 22, 2009. Under the M&A Rules, the approval of MOFCOM must be obtained in circumstances where overseas
companies established or controlled by PRC enterprises or residents acquire domestic companies affiliated with such PRC enterprises or
residents. Applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations also require certain merger and acquisition transactions to be subject to security
review.

Our
business may be subject to a variety of PRC laws and other obligations regarding cybersecurity and data protection.
Our
business may be subject to PRC laws relating to the collection, use, sharing, retention, security, and transfer of confidential and private
information, such as personal information and other data. These laws continue to develop, and the PRC government may adopt other rules
and restrictions in the future. Non-compliance could result in penalties or other significant legal liabilities.
Pursuant
to the PRC Cybersecurity Law, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on November 7,
2016 and took effect on June 1, 2017, personal information and important data collected and generated by a critical information infrastructure
operator in the course of its operations in China must be stored in China, and if a critical information infrastructure operator purchases
internet products and services that affects or may affect national security, it should be subject to cybersecurity review by the Cyberspace
Administration of China (“CAC”). Due to the lack of further interpretations, the exact scope of “critical information
infrastructure operator” remains unclear.
On
April 13, 2020, twelve Chinese government agencies jointly promulgated the Measures for Cybersecurity Review, which became effective
on June 1, 2020, set forth the cybersecurity review mechanism for critical information infrastructure operators, and provided that critical
information infrastructure operators who intend to purchase internet products and services that affect or may affect national security
shall be subject to a cybersecurity review. On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress promulgated
the PRC Data Security Law, which will take effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law provides for a security review procedure for
the data activities that may affect national security. Moreover, the State Internet Information Office issued the Measures of Cybersecurity
Review (Revised Draft for Comments, not yet effective) on July 10, 2021, which requires operators with personal information of more than
1 million users who want to list abroad to file a cybersecurity review with the CAC. Furthermore, the General Office of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Severe and Lawful Crackdown
on Illegal Securities Activities, which was available to the public on July 6, 2021. These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen
the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas listings by China-based companies. These opinions
proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems, to deal with the risks and incidents
facing China-based overseas-listed companies and the demand for cybersecurity and data privacy protection. As these laws, opinions and
the draft measures were recently issued, official guidance and interpretation of these remain unclear in several respects at this time,
and the PRC government authorities may have wide discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, opinions and the draft
measures. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the future regulatory changes would impose additional restrictions on our business.
The
Data Security Law also sets forth the data security protection obligations for entities and individuals handling personal data, including
that no entity or individual may acquire such data by stealing or other illegal means, and the collection and use of such data should
not exceed the necessary limits The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, PRC Cybersecurity Law and any other cybersecurity
and related laws may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business. Further,
if the enacted version of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review mandates clearance of cybersecurity review and other specific actions
to be completed by companies like us, we face uncertainties as to whether such clearance can be timely obtained, or at all.
We
are not be subject to the cybersecurity review by the CAC for overseas public offerings of our securities to foreign investors, given
that: (i) our products and services are offered not directly to individual users but through our institutional customers; (ii) we do
not possess a large amount of personal information in our business operations; and (iii) data processed in our business does not have
a bearing on national security and thus may not be classified as core or important data by the authorities. Further, we believe our newly
established companies and our business plan will not change the above conclusion. However, there remains uncertainty as to how the Draft
Measures will be interpreted or implemented and whether the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, may adopt new laws, regulations,
rules, or detailed implementation and interpretation related to the Draft Measures. If any such new laws, regulations, rules, or implementation
and interpretation comes into effect, we will take all reasonable measures and actions to comply and to minimize the adverse effect of
such laws on us.
We
cannot assure you that PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, would take the same view as we do, and there is no assurance that
we can fully or timely comply with such laws. In the event that we are subject to any mandatory cybersecurity review and other specific
actions required by the CAC, we face uncertainty as to whether any clearance or other required actions can be timely completed, or at
all. Given such uncertainty, we may be further required to suspend our relevant business, shut down our website, or face other penalties,
which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
34
PRC
regulations relating to investments in offshore companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC-resident beneficial owners or our PRC
Subsidiaries to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC Subsidiaries or limit our PRC Subsidiaries’
ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits.
SAFE
promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and
Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former
circular commonly known as “SAFE Circular 75” promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents
to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for
the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’ legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic
enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a “special purpose vehicle.” SAFE Circular
37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle,
such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material
event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration,
the PRC Subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from
carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to
contribute additional capital into its PRC Subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements
described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls.
We
have notified substantial beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock who we know are PRC residents of their filing obligation, and pursuant
to SAFE Circular 37, we have periodically filed and updated the above-mentioned foreign exchange registration on behalf of certain employee
shareholders who we know are PRC residents. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all of our beneficial owners who are PRC
residents. We do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC-resident beneficial owners will
comply with SAFE Circular 37 and subsequent implementation rules. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register
or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to SAFE Circular 37 and subsequent implementation rules, or the failure
of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular
37 and subsequent implementation rules, may subject the beneficial owners or our PRC Subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. On February
13, 2015, SAFE promulgated a Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment,
or SAFE Notice 13, which became effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to SAFE Notice 13, entities and individuals are required to apply
for foreign exchange registration of foreign direct investment and overseas direct investment, including those required under the SAFE
Circular 37, with designated domestic banks, instead of SAFE. The designated domestic banks will directly review the applications and
conduct the registration.
Furthermore,
since it is unclear how those new SAFE regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will
be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC government authorities, we cannot predict how these regulations will affect
our business operations or future strategy. Failure to register or comply with relevant requirements may also limit our ability to contribute
additional capital to our PRC Subsidiaries and limit our PRC Subsidiaries’ ability to distribute dividends to our company. These
risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
35
We
may be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, and we may therefore be subject
to PRC income tax on our global income.
Under
the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementing rules, both of which came into effect on January 1, 2008, enterprises established
under the laws of jurisdictions outside of China with “de facto management bodies” located in China may be considered PRC
tax resident enterprises for tax purposes and may be subject to the PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on their global income.
“De facto management body” refers to a managing body that exercises substantive and overall management and control over the
production and business, personnel, accounting books and assets of an enterprise. The State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice
Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore-Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the basis of de
facto management bodies, or Circular 82, on April 22, 2009. Circular 82 provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the
“de facto management body” of a Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated enterprise is located in China. Although Circular
82 only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises, not those controlled by foreign enterprises or individuals, the
determining criteria set forth in Circular 82 may reflect the State Administration of Taxation’s general position on how the “de
facto management body” test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether
they are controlled by PRC enterprises. If we were to be considered a PRC resident enterprise, we would be subject to PRC enterprise
income tax at the rate of 25% on our global income. In such case, our profitability and cash flow may be materially reduced as a result
of our global income being taxed under the Enterprise Income Tax Law. We believe that none of our entities outside of China is a PRC
resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax
authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body.”
Restrictions
on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize our PRC revenue effectively.
We
(Addentax Group Corp.) are a Nevada holding company with no material operations of our own. We conduct substantially all of our operations
through the operating companies established in the PRC, primarily YX,
our wholly owned subsidiary and its subsidiaries. We are a holding company and do not directly own any substantive business operations
in China. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in Renminbi. The Renminbi is currently convertible under the “current
account,” which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but requires approval from or registration
with appropriate government authorities or designated banks under the “capital account,” which includes foreign direct investment
and loans, including loans we may secure from our onshore subsidiaries. Currently, one of our PRC Subsidiaries, which is a wholly-foreign
owned enterprise, may purchase foreign currency for settlement of “current account transactions,” including payment of dividends
to us, without the approval of SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant PRC governmental authorities
or the local bank may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future for current account transactions.
Since
2016, PRC governmental authorities have imposed more stringent restrictions on outbound capital flows, including heightened scrutiny
over “irrational” overseas investments for certain industries, as well as over four kinds of “abnormal” offshore
investments, which are:
●
investments
through enterprises established for only a few months without substantive operation;
●
investments
with amounts far exceeding the registered capital of onshore parent and not supported by its business performance shown on financial
statements;
●
investments
in targets which are unrelated to onshore parent’s main business; and
●
investments
with abnormal sources of Renminbi funding suspected to be involved in illegal transfer of assets or illegal operation of underground
banking.
36
On
January 26, 2017, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Further Improving Reform of Foreign Exchange Administration and Optimizing Genuineness
and Compliance Verification, which tightened the authenticity and compliance verification of cross-border transactions and cross-border
capital flow, including requiring banks to verify board resolutions, tax filing forms and audited financial statements before wiring
foreign invested enterprises’ foreign exchange dividend distribution of over US$50,000. In addition, the Outbound Investment Sensitive
Industry Catalogue (2018) lists certain sensitive industries that are subject to NDRC pre-approval requirements prior to remitting investment
funds offshore, which subjects us to increased approval requirements and restrictions with respect to our overseas investment activity.
Since a significant amount of our PRC revenue is denominated in Renminbi, any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may
limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in Renminbi to fund our business activities outside of the PRC, make investments, service
any debt we may incur outside of China or pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders.
The
disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any
regulatory bodies in the PRC.
We
are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Our SEC reports and other disclosure and public pronouncements
are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings
are not subject to the review by China Securities Regulatory Commission, a PRC regulator that is responsible for oversight of the capital
markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings and our other public pronouncements with the understanding
that no local regulator has done any review of us, our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public pronouncements.
Introduction
of new laws or changes to existing laws by the PRC government may adversely affect our business.
The
PRC legal system is a codified legal system made up of written laws, regulations, circulars, administrative directives and internal guidelines.
Unlike common law jurisdictions like the U.S., decided cases (which may be taken as reference) do not form part of the legal structure
of the PRC and thus have no binding effect on subsequent cases with similar issues and fact patterns. Furthermore, in line with its transformation
from a centrally-planned economy to a more free market-oriented economy, the PRC government is still in the process of developing a comprehensive
set of laws and regulations. As the legal system in the PRC is still evolving, laws and regulations or the interpretation of the same
may be subject to further changes. For example, the PRC government may impose restrictions on the amount of service fees that may be
payable by municipal governments to wastewater and sludge treatment service providers. Also, the PRC central and municipal governments
may impose more stringent environmental regulations which would affect our ability to comply with, or our costs to comply with, such
regulations. Such changes, if implemented, may adversely affect our business operations and may reduce our profitability.
Risks
Relating to Our Holding Company Structure
Substantial
uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the newly enacted Foreign Investment Law and how it may
impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations.
On
March 15, 2019, the PRC National People’s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2020
and replaces the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in the PRC, namely, the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise
Law, the Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation
rules and ancillary regulations and become the legal foundation for foreign investment in the PRC. Meanwhile, the Implementation Regulation
of the Foreign Investment Law and the Measures for Reporting of Information on Foreign Investment came into effect as of January
1, 2020, which clarified and elaborated the relevant provisions of the Foreign Investment Law.
37
The
Foreign Investment Law sets out the basic regulatory framework for foreign investments and proposes to implement a system of pre-entry
national treatment with a negative list for foreign investments, pursuant to which (i) foreign entities and individuals are prohibited
from investing in the areas that are not open to foreign investments, (ii) foreign investments in the restricted industries must satisfy
certain requirements under the law, and (iii) foreign investments in business sectors outside of the negative list will be treated equally
with domestic investments. The Foreign Investment Law also sets forth necessary mechanisms to facilitate, protect and manage foreign
investments and proposes to establish a foreign investment information reporting system, through which foreign investors or foreign-invested
enterprises are required to submit initial report, report of changes, report of deregistration and annual report relating to their investments
to the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, or its local branches.
Although
our operating structure is legal and permissible under the current Chinese law and regulations, including the Foreign Investment Law,
Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our operating structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations
and/or the value of our common stock, including that it could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless.
We
may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC Subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may
have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC Subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material and adverse effect on our
ability to conduct our business.
We
are a Nevada holding company and we rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity from our PRC Subsidiaries for our
cash requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders for services of any
debt we may incur. If our PRC Subsidiaries incur debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict
their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Under PRC laws and regulations, our PRC Subsidiaries, which are wholly
foreign-owned enterprises, may pay dividends only out of their respective accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting
standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated after-tax
profits each year, if any, to fund a certain statutory reserve fund, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered
capital. Such reserve funds cannot be distributed to us as dividends. At its discretion, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise may allocate
a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to an enterprise expansion fund, or a staff welfare and bonus fund.
A
portion of our revenue was generated by our PRC Subsidiaries in Renminbi, which is not freely convertible into other currencies. As a
result, any restriction on currency exchange may limit the ability of our PRC Subsidiaries to use their Renminbi revenues to pay dividends
to us.
The
PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls, and more restrictions and substantial vetting process may be put forward
by SAFE for cross-border transactions falling under both the current account and the capital account. Any limitation on the ability of
our PRC Subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other kinds of payments to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow,
make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.
In
addition, the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax rate of up to 10% will be applicable
to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties
or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC-resident enterprises
are incorporated.
38
PRC
regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion
may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of our offerings to make loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries,
which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.
We
are an offshore holding company conducting our operations in China through our PRC Subsidiaries. We may in the future make loans or provide
guarantee to our PRC Subsidiaries subject to the approval or registration from governmental authorities and limitation of amount, or
we may make additional capital contributions to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary in China. Any loans to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries
in China, which are treated as foreign-invested enterprise under PRC law, are subject to foreign exchange loan registrations. In addition,
a foreign-invested enterprise, or FIE, shall use its capital pursuant to the principle of authenticity and self-use within its business
scope. The capital of an FIE shall not be used for the following purposes: (i) directly or indirectly used for payment beyond the business
scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations; (ii) directly or indirectly used for investment
in securities or investments other than banks’ principal-secured products unless otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations;
(iii) the granting of loans to non-affiliated enterprises, except where it is expressly permitted in the business license; and (iv) paying
the expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises).
In
light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies,
we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals
on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans by us to our PRC Subsidiaries or with respect to future capital contributions
by us to our PRC Subsidiaries. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds from
our offerings and to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely
affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.
Risks
Related to our Common Stock
The
market price of our shares is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as:
●
variations
in our actual and perceived operating results;
●
news
regarding gains or losses of customers or partners by us or our competitors;
●
news
regarding gains or losses of key personnel by us or our competitors;
●
announcements
of competitive developments, acquisitions or strategic alliances in our industry by us or our competitors;
●
changes
in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by financial analysts;
●
potential
litigation;
●
the
imposition of fines or penalties related to our activities in the PRC and failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations;
●
general
market conditions or other developments affecting us or our industry; and
●
the
operating and stock price performance of other companies, other industries and other events or factors beyond our control.
In
addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to
the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price
of the shares.
39
We
may never be able to pay dividends and are unlikely to do so.
To
date, we have not paid, nor do we intend to pay in the foreseeable future, dividends on our Common Stock, even if we become profitable.
Earnings, if any, are expected to be used to advance our activities and for working capital and general corporate purposes, rather than
to make distributions to stockholders. Since we are not in a financial position to pay dividends on our common stock and future dividends
are not presently being contemplated, investors are advised that return on investment in our common stock is restricted to an appreciation
in the share price. The potential or likelihood of an increase in share price is uncertain.
In
addition, under Nevada law, we may only pay dividends subject to our ability to service our debts as they become due and provided that
our assets will exceed our liabilities after the dividend. Our ability to pay dividends will therefore depend on our ability to generate
sufficient profits. Further, because of the various rules applicable to our operations in China and the regulations on foreign investments
as well as the applicable tax law, we may be subject to further limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to our shareholders.
Shareholders
may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities.
Wherever
possible, our board of directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that
the non-cash consideration will consist of shares of our common stock, warrants to purchase shares of our common stock or other securities.
Our board of directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued
shares of common stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares
of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests
of existing shareholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve
to enhance existing management’s ability to maintain control of us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed
to supporting existing management.
In
the event that our shares are traded, they may trade under $5.00 per share and thus will be a penny stock. Trading in penny stocks has
many restrictions and these restrictions could severely affect the price and liquidity of our shares.
In
the event that our stock trades below $5.00 per share, our stock would be known as a “penny stock”, which is subject to
various regulations involving disclosures to be given to you prior to the purchase of any penny stock. The SEC has adopted
regulations which generally define a “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00
per share, subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market fluctuations, our common stock could be considered to be a
“penny stock”. A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers
who sell these securities to persons other than accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker/dealer
must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition, the broker/dealer must receive the
purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the
purchaser. Consequently, the “penny stock” rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and
may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them. These disclosures require you to
acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with buying penny stocks and that you can absorb the loss of your entire
investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently, the price of the stock
is often volatile and you may not be able to buy or sell the stock when you want to.
40
The
issuances of our Common Stock to the Selling Stockholders or the Placement Agent upon conversion of Warrants or exercise of the Notes,
as the case may be, will cause dilution to our existing stockholders, and the sale of the shares of Common Stock acquired by the Selling
Stockholders or the Placement Agent, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our Common Stock to fall.
Depending
on market liquidity at the time, issuances and any subsequent sales of our common stock may cause the trading price of our common stock
to fall.
We
previously registered 197,227,433 shares of our common stock for their resale by selling stockholders which consisted of:
●
Up
to 164,373,089 shares of common stock (the “PIPE Stocks”), consisting of (i) 82,186,544 shares of common stock issuable
upon the conversion of our senior secured convertible notes (the “Notes”) issued to the selling stockholders pursuant
to the securities purchase agreement, dated as of January 4, 2023, by and between us and the selling stockholders (the “PIPE
Securities Purchase Agreement”), and (ii) 82,186,544 additional shares of common stock that we are required to register pursuant
to a registration rights agreement between us and certain selling stockholders obligating us to register 200% of the maximum number
of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes;
●
Up
to 32,154,344 shares of common stock (the “PIPE Warrant Stocks”), consisting of (i) 16,077,172 shares of our common stock
issued or issuable upon the exercise of warrants (the “PIPE Warrants”) that were issued pursuant to the PIPE Securities
Purchase Agreement, and (ii) 16,077,172 additional shares of common stock that we are required to register pursuant to a registration
rights agreement between us and certain selling stockholders obligating us to register 200% of the maximum number of shares of common
stock issuable upon exercise of the PIPE Warrant Stocks; and
●
Up
to 700,000 shares of common stock (the “Placement Agent Warrant Stocks”) issued or issuable upon the exercise of placement
agent warrants (the “Placement Agent Warrants”) that were issued to the placement agent pursuant to the PIPE placement
agency agreement (the “PIPE Placement Agency Agreement”), dated as of January 4, 2023.
If
and when the selling stockholders or placement agent convert and/or exercise their warrants or Notes, as the case may be, after the selling
stockholders or the placement agents has acquired the shares, the selling stockholders or the placement agent may resell all, some, or
none of those shares at any time or from time to time in its discretion. Therefore, issuances to the selling stockholders or the placement
agent upon exercise of their warrants or conversion of the Notes could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders
of our common stock. Even though the current trading price is significantly below our IPO price, the selling shareholders or the placement
agent may have an incentive to sell because they will still profit because of the lower price that they acquired their shares than the
retail investors. Additionally, the issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to the selling stockholders or the
placement agent, or the anticipation of such issuances, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities
in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.
You
may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings and other issuances of our securities.
In
order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional common stocks or other securities convertible into or exchangeable
for our common stocks at prices that may not be the same as the price per share paid by the investors in this offering. We may not be
able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share
paid by the investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior
to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional common stocks or securities convertible into common stocks
in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid to the selling stockholders. Our stockholders will incur
dilution upon exercise of any outstanding stock options, warrants or other convertible securities or upon the issuance of common stocks
under our share incentive programs.
We
expect to require additional capital in the future in order to develop our business operations. If we do not obtain any such additional
financing, it may be difficult to effectively realize our long-term strategic goals and objectives.
Any
additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-backed securities may dilute our stockholders’ ownership percentages
and could also result in a decrease in the market value of our equity securities.
The
terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences,
superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders
of any of our securities then outstanding.
In
addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting
fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash
expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial
condition.
41
Future
sales of substantial amounts of the shares of common stock by existing stockholders could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
If
we or our existing stockholders, our directors or their affiliates or certain of our executive officers, sell a substantial number of
our common stocks in the public market, including the Resale Shares once issuable upon exercise of the PIPE Warrants and the Placement
Agent Warrants, the market price of our common stocks could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that we or our
stockholders might sell our common stocks could also depress the market price of our common stocks and could impair our future ability
to obtain capital, especially through an offering of equity securities.
The
market price of our Common Stock may be subject to fluctuation and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Our
Common Stock was first offered publicly in our IPO in August 2022 at a price of $5.00 per share, and our Common Stock has subsequently
traded as high as $656.54 per share and as low as $0.78 per share as of the date of this Form 10-K. The market price of our Common
Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including,
but not limited to:
●
variations
in our actual and perceived operating results;
●
news
regarding gains or losses of customers or partners by us or our competitors;
●
news
regarding gains or losses of key personnel by us or our competitors;
●
announcements
of competitive developments, acquisitions or strategic alliances in our industry by us or our competitors;
●
changes
in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by financial analysts;
●
potential
litigation;
●
the
imposition of fines or penalties related to our activities in the PRC and failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations;
●
general
market conditions or other developments affecting us or our industry; and
●
the
operating and stock price performance of other companies, other industries and other events or factors beyond our control.
These
factors and any corresponding price fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and result
in substantial losses being incurred by our investors. In the past, following periods of market volatility, public company stockholders
have often instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could impose a substantial
cost upon us and divert the resources and attention of our management from our business.

Risk
Management and Strategy
We
identify and assess material risks from cybersecurity threats to our information systems and the information residing in our information
systems by monitoring and evaluating our threat environment on an ongoing basis using various methods including, for example, using manual
and automated tools, subscribing to reports and services that identify cybersecurity threats, analyzing reports of threats and threat
actors, conducting scans of the threat environment, and conducting risk assessments.
We
manage material risks from cybersecurity threats to our information systems and the information residing in our information systems through
various processes and procedures, including, depending on the environment, risk assessment, incident detection and response, vulnerability
management, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, internal controls within our accounting and financial reporting functions,
encryption of data, network security controls, access controls, physical security, asset management, systems monitoring, and employee
training. We engage third-party service providers to provide some of the resources used in our information systems and some third-party
service providers have access to information residing in our information systems. With respect to such third parties, we seek to engage
reliable, reputable service providers that maintain cybersecurity programs. Depending on the nature and extent of the services provided,
the sensitivity and quantity of information processed, and the identity of the service provider, our processes may include conducting
due diligence on the cybersecurity practices of such provider and contractually imposing cybersecurity related obligations on the provider.
We
are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any cybersecurity incidents, which have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect our Group, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.
Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors— Risks Associated with Our Company — Unauthorized disclosure, destruction or modification
of data, through cybersecurity breaches, computer viruses or otherwise or disruption of our services could expose us to liability, protracted

Overview
Our
Business
We
(Addentax Group Corp.) are a Nevada holding company with no material operations of our own. We conduct substantially all of our operations
through our operating companies established in the PRC, primarily YX,
our wholly owned subsidiary and its subsidiaries. We are not a Chinese operating company. We are a holding company and do not directly
own any substantive business operations in China. Therefore, our investors will not directly hold any equity interests in our operating
companies. Our holding company structure involves unique risks to investors. Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our operating
structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our common stock, including that it could
cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. Our holding company, Addentax Group Corp., is listed
on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol of “ATXG”. We classify our businesses into three main segments: garment manufacturing,
logistics services, and property management and subleasing.

subsidiaries, namely Dongguan Heng Sheng Wei Garments Co., Ltd (“HSW”), Dongguan Yushang Clothing Co., Ltd (“YS”)

Business
Objectives
Garment
Manufacturing Business
We
believe the strength of our garment manufacturing business is mainly due to our consistent emphasis on exceptional quality and timely
delivery. The primary business objective for our garment manufacturing segment is to expand our customer base and improve our profit.
Logistics
Services Business
The
business objective and future plan for our logistics services segment is to establish an efficient logistics system and to build a nationwide
delivery and courier network in China. As of March 31, 2025, we provide logistics services to over 44 cities in approximately 10 provinces
and 2 municipalities. We expect to develop 20 additional logistics routes in existing serving cities and improve the Company’s
profit in the year 2025.
Property
Management and Subleasing Business
The
business objective of our property management and subleasing segment is to integrate resources in shopping mall, develop e-commerce bases
and the Internet celebrity economy together to drive to increase the value of the stores in the area. We conduct the business through
a wholly owned subsidiary acquired in September 2023, namely Dongguan Hongxiang Commercial Co., Ltd., a PRC company (“HX”).
Seasonality
of Business
Garment
Manufacturing Business
We
generally receive more purchase orders during our second and third quarters and fewer manufacture orders during May and June.
Logistics
Services Business
We
generally receive more delivery orders in our third and fourth quarters and are more vulnerable to shipping delays in the PRC during
Chinese New Year due to traffic and port congestion, border crossing delays and customs clearance issues.
Property
Management and Subleasing Business
There
is no significant seasonality in our business.
Collection
Policy
Garment
manufacturing business
For
our new customers, we generally require orders placed to be backed by advances or deposits. For our long-term and established customers
with good payment track records, we generally provide payment terms between 30 to 180 days following the delivery of finished goods.
Logistics
Services business
For
logistics services, we generally receive payments from the customers between 30 to 90 days following the date of the registration of
our receipt of packages.
47
Property
management and subleasing business
For
property management and subleasing business, we generally collect rental and management fees of the following month each month in advance.
Economic
Uncertainty
Our
business is dependent on consumer demand for our products and services. We believe that the significant uncertainty in the economy in
China has increased our clients’ sensitivity to the cost of our products and services. We have experienced continued pricing pressure.
If the economic environment becomes weak, the economic conditions could have a negative impact on our sales growth and operating margins,
cash position and collection of accounts receivable. Additionally, business credit and liquidity have tightened in China. Some of our
suppliers and customers may face credit issues and could experience cash flow problems and other financial hardships. These factors currently
have not had an impact on the timeliness of receivable collections from our customers. We cannot predict at this time how this situation
will develop and whether accounts receivable may need to be allowed for or written off in the coming quarters.
Despite
the various risks and uncertainties associated with the current economy in China, we believe our core strengths will continue to allow
us to execute our strategy for long-term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and operating cash flow.
Summary
of Critical Accounting Policies
We
have identified critical accounting policies that, as a result of judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying
accounting standards and operation involved could result in material changes to our financial position or results of operations under
different conditions or using different assumptions.
Estimates
and Assumptions
We
regularly evaluate the accounting estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates
are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.
Revenue
Recognition
Revenue
is generated through sale of goods and delivery services. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or
services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods
or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive
in exchange for those goods and services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount:
(i)
identification
of the promised goods and services in the contract;
(ii)
determination
of whether the promised goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the
contract;
(iii)
measurement
of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
(iv)
allocation
of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
(v)
recognition
of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
48
The
Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled
to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606
at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which
of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated
to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, the Company’s
performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery.
For
all reporting periods, the Company has not disclosed the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for all product and service revenue
contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, which is an optional exemption that is permitted under the adopted rules.
Leases
Lessee
The
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in
property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
ROU
assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease
payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present
value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, The Company generally use the incremental
borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement
date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payments
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lessor
As
a lessor, the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases under ASC 842. Leases, in which the Company is the lessor, are
substantially all accounted for as operating leases and the lease components and non-lease components are accounted for separately. Rental
income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred
in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.
Accounts
receivable, net
Accounts
receivable, net are stated at the historical carrying amount net of allowance for doubtful accounts.
Account
receivables are classified as financial assets subsequently measured at amortized cost. Account receivables are recognized when the Company
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the receivables. They are measured, at initial recognition, at fair value plus transaction
costs, if any and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. The amortized cost is the amount recognized on the receivable initially,
minus principal repayments, plus cumulative amortization (interest) using the effective interest method of any difference between the
initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance.
A
loss allowance for expected credit losses is recognized on account receivables and is updated at each reporting date. The Company determines
the expected credit losses provisions based on ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (‘‘ASC 326’’) using a modified retrospective approach which did not have
a material impact on the opening balance of accumulated deficit. To determine expected credit losses on account receivables, the Company
will consider the historic credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions,
and an assessment of both the current and forecasted direction of conditions at the reporting date, including the time value of money,
where appropriate.
The
loss allowance is calculated on a collective basis for all trade and other receivables in totality. An impairment gain or loss is recognized
in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of account receivables, through use of a loss allowance account.
The impairment loss is included in operating expenses as a movement in credit loss allowance.
Receivables
are written off when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic
prospect of recovery, e.g., when the counterparty has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Receivables
written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Company’s recovery procedures, considering legal advice where
appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognized in profit or loss.
Recently
issued and adopted accounting pronouncements
Accounting
for Convertible Instruments: In August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s
Own Equity (ASU 2020-06), as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards
while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the
new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and
equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued
at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion
features in equity and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the “if-converted”
method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company’s current
accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the
fiscal year.
49
The
Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes will have
a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
Total
revenue for the year ended March 31, 2025 significantly decreased by approximately $1.0 million, or approximately 18.9%, as compared
with the year ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease of revenue from the logistics services business.
Revenue
generated from our garment manufacturing business contributed approximately $0.3 million, or approximately 6.8%, of our total revenue
for the year ended March 31, 2025. Revenue generated from the segment contributed approximately $0.2 million, or approximately 4.5%,
of our total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2024. The low amount of sales was mainly due to insufficient customer volume, we cannot
receive as large order quantity from remaining customers as before while new developed customer still at the start stage.
Revenue
generated from our logistics services business contributed approximately $3.0 million, or approximately 72.2%, of our total revenue for
the year ended March 31, 2025. Revenue generated from the segment contributed approximately $4.3 million, or approximately 84.3%, of
our total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2024. The decrease of approximately $1.3 million was mainly due to market volatility.
Revenue
generated from our property management and subleasing business contributed approximately $0.9 million, or approximately 21.0%, of our
total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2025. Revenue generated from our property management and subleasing business contributed approximately
$0.6 million, or approximately 11.3%, of our total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2024. The increase of approximately $0.3 million
was mainly due to improved rental rate.

Summary
of cash flows

cash flows information for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 is as follows:
2025

(In U.S. dollars)
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities
$816,001
$(411,473)
Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities
$(205,811)
$90,731
Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities
$(1,102,141)
$521,704
Net
cash provided by operating activities in the year ended March 31, 2025 increased by approximately $1.1 million compared with that of
the year ended March 31, 2024. It was mainly because the net loss adjusted to cash used in operating activities of fiscal year ended
March 31, 2025 was approximately $0.6 million less than the amount of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. The movement of operating
assets and liabilities of the year ended March 31, 2025 resulted in cash inflow of approximately $0.8 million compared to cash inflow
of approximately $0.3 million in the movement of operating assets and liabilities of the year ended March 31, 2024. We aim to improve
our operating cash flow by closely monitoring the timely collection of accounts and other receivables. We generally do not hold any significant
inventory for more than ninety days, as we typically manufacture upon customers’ order.
Net
cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2025 was approximately $0.3 million more than cash used in investing
activities for the year ended March 31, 2024. It was mainly because in the year ended March 31, 2024, there was $0.2 million cash
from newly acquired subsidiary.
Net
cash used in financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2025 was approximately $1.6 million more than the year ended March 31,
2024. In the year ended March 31 2025, the Company had receipt the proceeds of $0.6 million from issuance of Common Stock, payment

cash inflow of $0.3 million from bank loans, payment of $0.4 million of issuance cost of convertible debts, and net cash advance to related
parties of $3.9 million.

As
of March 31, 2025, we had cash on hand of approximately $0.3 million and restricted cash of approximately $2.8 million, total current
assets of approximately $29.8 million and current liabilities of approximately $4.0 million. We presently finance our operations primarily
from cash flows from revenue, fund raising from our IPO proceeds and capital contributions from our chief executive officer, Mr. Hong
Zhida (the “CEO”).
In
the event that the Company requires additional funding to finance the growth of the Company’s current and expected future operations
as well as to achieve our strategic objectives, the CEO has indicated the intent and ability to provide additional equity financing.
Foreign
Currency Translation Risk
Our
operations are located in the mainland China, which may give rise to significant foreign currency risks from fluctuations and the degree
of volatility in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”). All of our sales are in
RMB. In last year, RMB depreciated against the U.S. dollar. As of March 31, 2025, the market foreign exchange rate had decreased to RMB7.26
to one U.S. dollar. Our financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars using the closing rate method. The balance sheet items
are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates at the respective balance sheet dates. The capital and various reserves are
translated at historical exchange rates prevailing at the time of the transactions while income and expenses items are translated at
the average exchange rate for the period. All translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement
of equity. The foreign currency translation gain for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was $48,135 and $82,490, respectively.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) as of March 31, 2025 that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Addentax Group Corp.:
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Addentax Group Corp. (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2025, and
2024, and the related consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flow for the
year ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2025,
and 2024, and the result of its operations and its cash flow for year then ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.
Explanatory
Paragraph – Going Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more
fully described in Note 2(b) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred operating losses for the past two financial
years, which raises concerns about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These conditions indicate that a material
uncertainty exists that raise substantial doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans
in regard to these matters are also described in Note2(b) in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matter
The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of the critical audit matter
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.
Going
concern
Description
of the Matter
As
described in Note 2(b) to consolidated financial statements, the Company has a history of operating losses. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Historically, the Company has relied principally on both operational
sources of cash and non-operational sources of equity and debt financing to fund its operations and business development. The Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern depends on management’s ability to successfully execute its business plan which includes
increasing the utilization rate of existing staff and potential financing from public market or private placement. However, there is
no assurance that the measures above can be achieved as planned.
This
significant unusual situation is a critical audit matter as it relates to a material disclosure of going concern and involved complex
estimation by management.
How
we Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
Our
principal audit procedures included, among others:
●
Obtaining an understanding,
and evaluating management’s assessment on whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s
ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time;
●
Assessing the management’s
plans and obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence to determine whether or not substantial doubt can be alleviated or still
exists;
●
Reviewing the relevant
disclosures to the consolidated financial statements.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION
(a) Basis of Accounting
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the U.S Securities and Exchanges Commission (“SEC”) and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in
the U.S. (“US GAAP”). All material inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
(b) Going Concern
The Group has a history of operating losses, $5,094,198 and $3,109,418
and for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern.
Historically, the Group has relied principally on both operational
sources of cash and non-operational sources of equity and debt financing to fund its operations and business development. The Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern depends on management’s ability to successfully execute its business plan which includes
increasing the utilization rate of existing staff and potential financing from public market or private placement. However, there is
no assurance that the measures above can be achieved as planned. Nevertheless, management prepared the consolidated financial statements
assuming the Group will continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.
3.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a)
Use of Estimates
The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates
using the best information available at the time the estimates are made; however actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
(b)
Principles of Consolidation.
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries, as discussed above. A subsidiary is an entity
in which the Company, directly or indirectly, controls more than one half of the voting powers; or has the power to appoint or remove
the majority of the members of the board of directors; or to cast a majority of votes at the meeting of directors; or has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies of the investee under a statute or agreement among the shareholders or equity holders. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
(c)
Fair Value Measurement
Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820 “ Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures “, which defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement clarifies that the exchange
price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market in
which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability, that is, the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability. It also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and that market participant
assumptions include assumptions about risk and effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset.
This
ASC establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level
1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level
2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
full term of the asset or liability; and
Level
3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
by little or no market activity).
The
Company has derivative liabilities, embedded conversion feature and warrants that are not traded in an active market with readily observable
quoted prices, and therefore the Company used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) to measure the fair value of these options and
derivative liabilities at inception and at each subsequent balance sheet date. The change in fair value is recognized in the consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended March 31, 2025.
The
Company’s financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, advances to suppliers, other receivables, accounts payable,
other payables, taxes payables and related party receivables or payables. Management estimates that the carrying amounts of financial
instruments approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair value of amounts with related parties is not practicable
to estimate due to the related party nature of the underlying transactions.
(d)
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All
cash and cash equivalents relate to cash on hand and cash at bank at March 31, 2025 and 2024.
The
Renminbi is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. Under the PRC Foreign Exchange Control Regulations and Administration of
Settlement, Sales and Payment of Foreign Exchange Regulations, the Company is permitted to exchange Renminbi for foreign currencies through
banks that are authorized to conduct foreign exchange business.
F-7
(e)
Accounts Receivable, net
Accounts
receivable, net are stated at the historical carrying amount net of allowance for doubtful accounts.
Account
receivables are classified as financial assets subsequently measured at amortized cost. Account receivables are recognized when the Company
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the receivables. They are measured, at initial recognition, at fair value plus transaction
costs, if any and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. The amortized cost is the amount recognized on the receivable initially,
minus principal repayments, plus cumulative amortization (interest) using the effective interest method of any difference between the
initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance.
A
loss allowance for expected credit losses is recognized on account receivables and is updated at each reporting date. The Company determines
the expected credit losses provisions based on ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (‘‘ASC 326’’) using a modified retrospective approach which did not have
a material impact on the opening balance of accumulated deficit. To determine expected credit losses on account receivables, the Company
will consider the historic credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions,
and an assessment of both the current and forecasted direction of conditions at the reporting date, including the time value of money,
where appropriate.
The
loss allowance is calculated on a collective basis for all trade and other receivables in totality. An impairment gain or loss is recognized
in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of account receivables, through use of a loss allowance account.
The impairment loss is included in operating expenses as a movement in credit loss allowance. Allowance for doubtful accounts was $49,457
and Nil for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Receivables
are written off when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic
prospect of recovery, e.g., when the counterparty has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Receivables
written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Company’s recovery procedures, considering legal advice where
appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognized in profit or loss.
There
is no change in the accounting policies for the year ended March 31, 2025.
(f)
Inventories
Manufacturing
segment inventories consist of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on
a weighted average basis, or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business
less the estimated cost of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. When inventories are sold, their carrying amount
is charged to expense in the period in which the revenue is recognized. Write-downs for declines in net realizable value or for losses
of inventories are recognized as an expense in the period the impairment or loss occurs. No write-downs for obsolete finished goods for
the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
(g)
Plant and Equipment
Plant
and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over the assets’ estimated useful lives,
using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives of the plant and equipment are as follows:
SCHEDULE OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT USEFUL LIVES
Production plant
5-10 years
Motor vehicles
10-15 years
Office equipment
5-10 years
The
cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss is
included in the statement of loss and comprehensive loss. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to the statement of income as
incurred, whereas significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.
F-8
(h)
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived
assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of assets may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology
or other industry changes. Determination of recoverability of assets to be held and used is by comparing the carrying amount of an asset
to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to
be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
There
was no impairment of long-lived assets as of March 31, 2025 and 2024.
(i)
Revenue Recognition
Revenue
is generated through sale of goods, delivery services, and provision of property management and subleasing. Revenue is recognized when
a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company
expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing,
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the
consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. The Company applies the following five-step
model in order to determine this amount:
(i)
identification of the promised goods and services in the contract;
(ii)
determination of whether the promised goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context
of the contract;
(iii)
measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
(iv)
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
(v)
recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
The
Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled
to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606
at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which
of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated
to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, the Company’s
performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery of the good or service.
F-9
Rental
income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Cost
of revenues for garment manufacturing segment includes the direct raw material cost, direct labor cost, manufacturing overheads including
depreciation of production equipment and rent. Cost of revenue for logistics services segment includes gasoline and diesel fuel, toll
charges and subcontracting fees. Cost of revenue of property management and subleasing business was mainly the amortization of right-of-used
assets for the subleasing business.
(j)
Earnings Per Share
The
Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260 “Earnings Per Share”, which requires presentation of
basic and diluted earnings per share in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology used in computing such earnings per share.
Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average
common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could
occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted into common stock. Further, if the number of
common shares outstanding increases as a result of a stock dividend or stock split or decreases as a result of a reverse stock split,
the computations of a basic and diluted earnings per share shall be adjusted retroactively for all periods presented to reflect that
change in capital structure.
Diluted
earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net earnings (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders, as adjusted for the effect
of dilutive ordinary equivalent shares, if any, by the weighted average number of ordinary and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares outstanding
during the period. Ordinary equivalent shares consist of unvested restricted shares, Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding
share options using the treasury stock method, and Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of convertible note, option and preferred
shares using the if converted method. Ordinary equivalent shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share
calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive.
(k)
Income Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740 “Income Taxes”. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company
records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not
that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is
recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.
The
Company has a history of tax losses and there is no convincing evidence that sufficient taxable income will be available against which
the deferred tax asset can be utilized, therefore, the Company does not recognize any tax benefits for the year ended March 31, 2025
and 2024.
The
Company’s Chinese subsidiaries are governed by the Income Tax Laws of the PRC. The PRC federal statutory tax rate is 25%. The Company
files income tax returns with the relevant government authorities in the PRC. The Company does not believe there will be any material
changes in its unrecognized tax positions over the next 12 months.
The
Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
The Company does not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits, nor was any interest expense
recognized during the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the PRC federal statutory
rate primarily due to non-deductible expenses, temporary differences and preferential tax treatments.
F-10
The
U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Reform”), was signed into
law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Reform modified the U.S. Internal Revenue Code by, among other things, reducing the statutory
U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017; limiting and/or eliminating
many business deductions; migrating the U.S. to a territorial tax system with a one-time transaction tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation
of previously deferred foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries; subject to certain limitations, generally eliminating U.S. corporate
income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; and providing for new taxes on certain foreign earnings. Taxpayers may elect to pay
the one-time transition tax over eight years, or in a single lump-sum payment. The Company measured the current and deferred taxes based
on the provisions of the Tax legislation. After the Company’s measurement, no deferred tax benefit nor expense was recorded relating
to the Tax Act changes for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
(l)
Leases
Lessee
The
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
ROU
assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease
payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present
value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company generally use the incremental
borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement
date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payments
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lessor
As
a lessor, the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases under ASC 842. Leases, in which the Company is the lessor, are
substantially all accounted for as operating leases and the lease components and non-lease components are accounted for separately. Rental
income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred
in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.
(m)
Related parties
Parties
are considered to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are
controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related party also include principal owners of the Company, its management,
members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which he Company may deal
with if one party control or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the
transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company discloses all significant related
party transactions.
(n)
Recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements
Accounting
for Convertible Instruments: In August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s
Own Equity (ASU 2020-06), as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards
while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the
new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and
equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued
at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion
features in equity and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the “if-converted”
method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company’s current
accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the
fiscal year.
The
Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes will have
a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

DISPOSITION OF SUBSIDIARIES
The
Company disposed of its subsidiary Shantou Yi Bai Yi Garment Co., Ltd, a PRC Company (“YBY”), a manufacturing company in
garment manufacturing segment at end of August 2024 to the local management of YBY. After disposition, YBY became third party to the
Company. The Company will not have any businesses with YBY. The Company will carry on the garment manufacturing segment business through

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
On
January 4, 2023, the Company entered into a series of agreements with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company received
a net proceed of $15,000,000 in consideration of the issuance of:
●
senior
secured convertible notes in the aggregate original principal amount of approximately $16.7 million with interest rate of 5% per
annum (the “Convertible Notes”); The Convertible Notes shall be matured on July 4, 2024. The conversion price is $1.25,
subject to adjustment under several conditions.
●
warrants
to purchase up to approximately 16.1 million shares of common stock of the Company (the “Common Stock”) until on or prior
to 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on the five-year anniversary of the closing date at an exercise price of $1.25 per share, also subject
to adjustment under several conditions.
The
Warrant is considered a freestanding instrument issued together with the Convertible Note and measured at its issuance date fair value.
Proceeds received were first allocated to the Warrant based on its initial fair value. The initial fair value of the Warrant was $3.9
million. The Warrant were marked to the market with the changes in the fair value of warrant recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive loss. As of March 31, 2025, the balance of the Warrant was approximately $1.0 million.
The
Convertible Note is classified as a liability and is subsequently stated at amortized cost with any difference between the initial carrying
value and the repayment amount as interest expenses using the effective interest method over the period from the issuance date to the
maturity date. The embedded conversion feature is bifurcated and separately accounted for using fair value, as this embedded feature
is considered not clearly and closely related to the debt host. The bifurcated conversion feature was recorded at fair value with the
changes recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The initial fair value of the embedded conversion
feature was $1.2 million. As of March 31, 2025, the fair value of the conversion option was $1.4 million.
The
Company determined that the other embedded features do not require bifurcation as they either are clearly and closely related to the
Convertible Note or do not meet the definition of a derivative.
The
total proceeds of the Convertible Note and the Warrants, net of issuance cost, of $15.0 million was received by the Company in January
2023, and allocated to each of the financial instruments as following:

The
Company’s operations in the PRC are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies
in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environment

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The
Company received a letter dated April 9, 2025 from the Listings Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that the minimum bid price per share of its common stock was below $1.00 for
a period of 30 consecutive business days and that the Company did not meet the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Rule”). The Nasdaq letter does not result in the immediate delisting of the Company’s
shares of common stock, and the shares will continue to trade uninterrupted under the symbol “ATXG.”
Pursuant
to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has a compliance period of one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, or until October
6, 2025 (the “Compliance Period”), to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. If at any time during the Compliance
Period, the closing bid price per share of the Company’s common stock is at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive business
days, Nasdaq will provide the Company a written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed.
In
the event the Company does not regain compliance by the end of the Compliance Period, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180
calendar day grace period. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly
held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and
will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, including by effecting
a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company chooses to implement a reverse stock split, it must complete the split no later than
ten (10) business days prior to the end of the Compliance Period, or the end of the second compliance period if granted.
In
May 2025, the Company disposed of the subsidiary ATO to a related party with a loss of approximately $8,604.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025. Based on the evaluation
of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
Management’s
Remediation Initiatives
In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we plan to initiate
the following series of measures to further strengthen the Company’s internal controls going forward:
1.
hire a reporting manager (“Internal Finance Manager”) who has the requisite relevant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience
and qualifications;
2.
make an overall assessment on the current finance and accounting resources and hire additional accounting members with appropriate levels
of accounting knowledge and experience;
3.
streamline our accounting department structure and enhance our staff’s U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements on a continuous
basis through internal training provided by the Internal Finance manager;
4.
participate in trainings and seminars provided by professional services firms on a regular basis to gain knowledge on regular U.S. GAAP
/SEC reporting requirements updates; and
5.
engage an external “Sarbanes-Oxley 404” consulting firm to help us implement Sarbanes-Oxley 404 internal controls compliance
together with the establishment of our internal audit function.
We
anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2025.
Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)).
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
2025 using the criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025,
the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.
We
did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge of accounting, experience, and training
commensurate with its financial reporting requirements.
57
Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls.
As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There
was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting period covered by this report that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls
Our
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated,
is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

Board
Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight
The
Board currently consists of five directors. Mr. Hong Zhida holds the positions of chief executive officer and chairman of the board of
the Company. The board believes that Mr. Hong Zhida’s services as both chief executive officer and chairman of the board is in
the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Mr. Hong Zhida possesses detailed and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities
and challenges facing the Company in its business and is thus best positioned to develop agendas that ensure that the Board’s time
and attention are focused on the most critical matters relating to the business of the Company. His combined role enables decisive leadership,
ensures clear accountability, and enhances the Company’s ability to communicate its message and strategy clearly and consistently
to the Company’s shareholders, employees and customers.
The
board has not designated a lead director. Given the limited number of directors comprising the Board, the independent directors call
and plan their executive sessions collaboratively and, between meetings of the Board, communicate with management and one another directly.
Under these circumstances, the directors believe designating a lead director to take on responsibility for functions in which they all
currently participate might detract from rather than enhance performance of their responsibilities as directors.
Management
is responsible for assessing and managing risk, subject to oversight by the board of directors. The board oversees our risk management
policies and risk appetite, including operational risks and risks relating to our business strategy and transactions. Various committees
of the board assist the board in this oversight responsibility in their respective areas of expertise.
Code
of Ethics
In
September 2018, we adopted a Code of Ethical Business Conduct that applies to, among other persons, members of our board of directors,
our Company’s officers including our Chief Executive Officer, employees, consultants and advisors. As adopted, our Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics sets forth written standards that are designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:
1.

securities laws. Any senior officer, who becomes aware of any incidents involving financial or accounting manipulation or other irregularities,
whether by witnessing the incident or being told of it, must report it to our Company. Any failure to report such inappropriate or irregular

Trading Arrangements and Policies
We

functions. We intend to disclose future amendments to such policy, or any waivers of its requirements, applicable to any principal executive
officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions or our directors
on our website identified above or in a current report on Form 8-K that we would file with the SEC.
Our
directors and executive officers may adopt written plans, known as Rule 10b5-1 plans, in which they will contract with a broker to buy
or sell shares of our Common Stock on a periodic basis. Under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established
by the director or officer when entering into the plan, without further direction from them. The director or officer may amend a Rule
10b5-1 plan in some circumstances and may terminate a plan at any time. Our directors and executive officers also may buy or sell additional
shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan when they are not in possession of material non-public information subject to compliance with the
terms of our insider trading policy.

Option Plan
On
May 28, 2024, our Board adopted our 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2024 Equity Incentive Plan”), which was approved by
our shareholders at our annual shareholders meeting on June 28, 2024. The 2024 Equity Incentive Plan gives us the ability to grant stock
options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and other stock-based awards to officers, directors (including independent
directors), employees or consultants of our company or of any subsidiary of our company and to non-employee members of our advisory board
or our Board or the board of directors of any of our subsidiaries. The Board and the Compensation Committee believe the ability to grant
restricted stock, stock options and make other stock-based awards under the Plan is an important factor in attracting, stimulating and
retaining qualified and distinguished personnel with proven ability and vision to serve as employees, officers, consultants or members
of the Board or advisory board of our company and our subsidiaries, and to chart our course towards continued growth and financial success.

12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters
The
following table sets forth, as of June 29, 2025, certain information concerning the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock by (i) each
stockholder known by us to own beneficially five percent or more of our outstanding Common Stock or series a common stock; (ii) each
director; (iii) each named executive officer; and (iv) all of our executive officers and directors as a group, and their percentage ownership
and voting power. The column entitled “Percentage Ownership of Shares of Common Stock” is based on a total of 10,090,963 shares
of our issued and outstanding Common Stock.
The
information presented below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, a person
is deemed to be a “beneficial owner” of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of
the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed to own beneficially any security as
to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within sixty (60) days through the conversion
or exercise of any convertible security, warrant, option, or other right. More than one (1) person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner
of the same securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number
of shares beneficially owned by such person, which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting
or investment power within sixty (60) days, by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date. Consequently, the denominator
used for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner. Except as otherwise indicated below and under applicable
community property laws, we believe that the beneficial owners of our common stock listed below have sole voting and investment power
with respect to the shares shown.

The
increase of related party from Hong Zhida was short term loan to Hong Zhida, which is interest free and would be repaid in one year.
(2)
The
increase of related party debt from Yang Bihua was mainly due to the cash paid in advance to Yang Bihua. During year ended March
31, 2025, the Company received financial support of approximately $0.8 million from Yang Bihua and provided a short term loan of
approximately $1.3 million to Yang Bihua.
(3)
The
Company received financial support from Huang Dewu to fund company’s daily operation. The decrease is because YBY was disposed
of in August 2024.
The
borrowing balances of related parties are unsecured, non-interest bearing and repayable on demand.

years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, for (i) services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements and the review of our

fees consist of fees incurred for professional services rendered for the audit of financial statements, for reviews of our fiscal year
end financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and for services that are normally provided in connection with
statutory or regulatory filings or engagements. The aggregate fees in connection with services rendered by Pan-China Singapore PAC was
$120,000 for both years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Our
Board pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by
the Board either before or after the respective services were rendered.
Our
Board has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision of services for
activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining our independent auditors’ independence.
