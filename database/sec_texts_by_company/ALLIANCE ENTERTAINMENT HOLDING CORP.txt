CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain
statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may constitute “forward-looking statements” under federal securities laws.
Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about us and our industry, as well as statements
regarding our or our management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. These
forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or projected future results of our operations, including
statements about potential acquisition or merger targets, strategies or plans; business strategies; prospects; future cash flows;
financing plans; plans and objectives of management; any other statements regarding future cash needs, future operations, business
plans and future financial results; and any other statements that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements often include
words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
“plan,” “potential,” “will,” and similar expressions. However, the absence of these words does
not mean a statement is not forward-looking.
Forward-looking statements
should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and may not be accurate indications of when such performance or
results will be achieved. These statements
are based on our current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risks include, but are not limited to:
●
Risks
related to market acceptance and growth opportunities.
●
Potential
changes in laws or regulations.
●
Supply
chain disruptions and increased costs.
●
Dependence
on key suppliers and customers.
●
Risks
related to our significant indebtedness and compliance with debt covenants.
●
Litigation
and regulatory risks.
●
Economic
factors such as inflation and interest rates.
●
Challenges
in retaining key personnel.
●
Cybersecurity
threats and IT infrastructure issues.
●
Environmental,
safety, and product liability concerns.
●
Risks
related to potential acquisitions.
●
Changes
in U.S. tax laws.
●
Risks Related to International Trade Policies and Tariffs.
These statements relate to future
events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our
actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievement to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. We discuss in greater detail, and incorporate by reference into this prospectus in their entirety, many of these risks and
uncertainties under the heading “Risk Factors” contained in this prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference
herein. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is
not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.
Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all
potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely
upon these statements.
Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Given these risks and uncertainties, we
caution investors not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are based on information available as of the
date of this filing. We are not obligated to update these statements to reflect new information or future events, except as required
by law.

as a trusted partner across the entertainment and collectibles landscape.

in core media and entertainment product areas in five primary categories:

Technology:
Alliance
continues to improve its warehouse operations through targeted investments in automated handling equipment at its Shepherdsville, Kentucky
facility. In April 2024, the Company implemented the OPEX Sure Sort X® system to automate the sortation of non-standard size products.
This enhancement replaced manual sorting processes, reducing labor costs, accelerating processing times, and lowering the potential for
product damage.
In
December 2022, Alliance implemented an AutoStore Automated Storage & Retrieval System, which improved warehouse speed, reliability,
capacity, and accuracy. Together, these automation initiatives have contributed to operational efficiencies and cost savings.

Alliance’s
technology platforms provide stakeholders with seamless access to the Company’s global inventory through a modern, user-friendly
interface accessible on desktop, notebook, and mobile devices. Key features include:
●
Advanced
product search and personalized selection tools
●
Integrated
marketing and customer relationship management (CRM) tools supporting multi-channel retailer marketplaces
●
Conversational
commerce and Fintech solutions providing diverse payment options
●
Self-service
purchasing and 24/7 customer support
These
capabilities enhance transaction efficiency and engagement, supporting revenue growth and profitability relative to legacy distribution
systems. Management believes these platforms enhance stakeholder productivity and competitiveness.
Industry
Background
The
industries in which the Company distributes products are:
●
Packaged
Goods consisting of licensed physical media and entertainment content;
●
Gaming
Consoles and Accessories; and
●
Licensed
Toys and Collectables.
Distributors
of physical media continue to navigate changes in consumer demand, an evolving omni-channel retail environment, and ongoing supplier
consolidation. While many consumers have shifted to digital formats such as streaming music and video services, management believes a
growing market remains for collectible physical media, including vinyl records, specialty SteelBook® DVDs, CD box sets, and pop culture
collectibles.
This
shift in demand, coupled with structural changes in the retail and supplier landscape, is contributing to the consolidation of distribution
networks. Management believes this presents an opportunity for distributors, such as Alliance, that are positioned to meet the evolving needs of retailers
and suppliers, such as Alliance.
Although
overall demand for physical media has declined, niche markets serving music and movie enthusiasts have shown growth. This trend is
reflected in the rising popularity of K-pop releases in CD and vinyl formats, special edition SteelBook® DVDs, and 4K UHD
Blu-ray titles particularly among consumers seeking exclusive content. Nostalgia and collector-driven purchases remain a factor driving customer demand,
with buyers valuing artwork, perceived audio quality, and the intrinsic value of limited-edition formats.
As
major retail chains reduce shelf space for physical media, management believes distributors with direct-to-consumer capabilities and
fulfillment services for retail e-commerce platforms, such as Alliance, are increasingly well-positioned. These capabilities allow retailers to expand product
offerings without the need for incremental warehouse space or inventory carrying costs.
Suppliers
are also adapting to this shift. By partnering with distributors, such as Alliance, that serve both mass and niche channels, suppliers can reach broader
consumer bases through a more efficient distribution model. Exclusive and limited-edition releases allow suppliers to maintain premium
pricing, and collaboration on marketing and promotional campaigns can further support product visibility and sell-through.
The
physical media market remains competitive as companies seek to serve a more targeted customer base. Management believes that long-term
success in this environment requires differentiation through exclusive content, curated product offerings, and enhanced customer service.
The ability to anticipate consumer preferences and quickly deliver relevant entertainment experiences is increasingly important.
Specialized
distributors may have a relative advantage in this regard due to their agility and ability to respond quickly to market trends. In
management’s view, partnerships with artists and content creators to secure exclusive releases offer Alliance an additional
competitive edge. Alliance leverages its broad product portfolio to create bundled, exclusive collectibles that support omni-channel retail
strategies and appeal to collectors and enthusiasts.
4
Market
Opportunity
The
Company has identified three primary market areas where it currently conducts business and plans to grow its operations:
Content
Media
As
technology and consumer trends evolve, film, music, and gaming studios continue to re-evaluate distribution strategies to address
shifting behaviors and expanding digital and physical platforms. Despite the rise of streaming and digital delivery, consumer demand
for physical media remains resilient, driven by factors such as collectibility, superior audio-visual quality, and the intrinsic
value of physical packaging.
In response to this opportunity, the Company recently launched Alliance
Home Entertainment, a dedicated business unit established through a multi-year distribution agreement with Paramount Home Entertainment.
This new division will handle the exclusive distribution of Paramount’s physical home video products across all major retail channels
and direct-to-consumer platforms, including the management of catalog returns beginning January 31, 2025. The launch of Alliance Home
Entertainment positions the Company as a trusted partner for major studios seeking a more efficient, centralized, and experienced physical
media distributor.
Simultaneously,
the Company is capitalizing on demand from collectors and enthusiasts through the expansion of its physical music and video
offerings, most notably vinyl records, SteelBooks™, and special edition box sets. The Company believes that consumers
continue to favor tangible media formats for their superior sound and picture quality, unique artwork, and collectible
nature.
To
further extend its reach into consumer lifestyle categories, the Company recently launched Alliance Authentic, a new brand focused
on officially licensed merchandise and collectible products from leading artists, creators, and entertainment brands. This business complements
our core media offerings and addresses growing demand for branded, limited-edition pop culture products that can be marketed through
both B2B and DTC channels.
Fulfillment
The
global e-commerce fulfillment services market continues to experience strong growth driven by increasing online sales penetration, particularly
in North America. Large retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, Target, and Best Buy are increasingly relying on fulfillment partners to improve
speed, flexibility, and service levels while maintaining cost efficiency.
Alliance
is well-positioned to serve this expanding market through its scalable third-party logistics (3PL) and direct-to-consumer fulfillment
solutions. By combining physical inventory depth, technology-driven distribution, and established carrier relationships, the Company
enables retailers, brands, and suppliers to reach their customers more effectively. As retailers and manufacturers focus on core competencies,
the outsourcing of logistics and fulfillment operations is expected to accelerate, further expanding the addressable market for Alliance’s
services.
Our
Competitive Strengths
Alliance
is one of the largest physical media and entertainment and collectibles product distributors in the world and a leader in
fulfillment and e-commerce distribution solutions. Its existing product and service offering has positioned the Company to
capitalize on shifts towards e-commerce and Omni-Channel strategies, especially as retailers and manufacturers greatly increase
their reliance on their direct-to-consumer fulfillment and distribution partners.
We
believe that our key strengths position us to deliver on our strategy to grow profitably, optimize our core physical media and
entertainment and collectibles product distributors’ fulfillment and e-commerce distribution solutions, and expand and
continue to invest in higher-margin advanced technology solutions and high-value services.
5
The
Company believes the following strengths are key to its ability to grow and maintain its position as a market leader:
●
Proven
Management Experience and Equity Rollover. With over 30 years of operations and experience, Alliance management has extensive
knowledge and is rolling over all their equity in the Business Combination in preparation to lead the Company towards future growth.
●
Significant
barriers to entry and market leadership. Alliance is a leader in fulfillment and e-commerce distribution with over 340,000 SKUs
in stock. The company’s market leadership is further protected by a three-pronged moat of services, selection, and technology.
The company’s platforms create efficiencies that benefit its partners in the physical media and entertainment marketplace.
As a result, both suppliers and retail customers rely on the company’s platforms to drive transaction volume.
●
Strategic
Partnerships with Major Content Providers. Through Alliance Home Entertainment, the Company has established strong distribution
relationships with major studios and independent content owners. Most recently, the Company secured an exclusive distribution agreement
with Paramount Home Entertainment, reinforcing Alliance’s role as a key physical media partner and unlocking new growth opportunities
within the home entertainment segment.
●
Expansion
into Premium Collectibles and Licensed Merchandise
Alliance
Authentic, the Company’s newest division, is focused on delivering curated, premium collectible products through exclusive
licensing partnerships and proprietary brands. This leverages Alliance’s core distribution infrastructure and deep relationships
in entertainment to capitalize on the growing demand for pop culture merchandise.
●
Organic
Growth Opportunities. Alliance will seek to grow revenue and expand margins through the expansion of partnerships with vendors
and customers and investment in existing facilities.
●
Proven
track record of building scale through significant acquisitions. Since its inception, Alliance has successfully acquired and
integrated ten businesses that have greatly expanded the vendors and customers we are supporting. This M&A activity has built
scale and added capabilities to the Company’s platforms. Further, Alliance has demonstrated an ability to integrate those companies
into its existing platforms to fundamentally improve the acquired businesses. Alliance management believes significant consolidation
opportunities remain to drive future growth by acquiring complementary businesses and competitors.
●
Modern
technology distribution platform and interface. The Company’s technology platform increases transaction efficiency, provides
great mobile accessibility, and incorporates modern marketing and Fintech tools.
Strategy
for Future Growth
Alliance
will continue to capitalize on its services, selection, and scalable distribution network technology to propel its future growth both
organically and through acquisitions. With a public listing, we have access to additional capital to finance future growth.
Our
strategy will include:
●
Execute
Acquisition Strategy. Alliance has a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating competitors and complementary
businesses. With additional capital, Alliance will be able to execute its acquisition strategy more effectively.
●
Increase
Market Share. Expanding its existing product and service offerings and executing its acquisition strategy will drive Alliance’s
efforts toward increasing market share. The Company has historically built scale and added capabilities through acquisitions. It
has demonstrated an ability to execute accretive and synergistic acquisitions as well as integrate and fundamentally improve the
acquired businesses. Alliance expects to continue pursuing strategic opportunities that strengthen its platforms, expand the breadth
and depth of its content, and enhance its distribution infrastructure. Alliance will continue to actively monitor and evaluate these
and future opportunities in its acquisition pipeline in both the near and mid-term.
6
●
Enhance
Direct to Consumer (DTC) Relationships and Capabilities. Alliance’s DTC services are in greater demand as consumer preferences
shift and stress retailers’ e-commerce and DTC capabilities. Enhancing DTC relationships will grow existing revenue lines and
improving capabilities will generate a more attractive overall service offering.
●
Expand
into New Consumer Products. Leveraging existing relationships, Alliance can expand into new consumer product segments, growing
its product offering and providing more to its existing customer base while attracting new customers in the process.
●
Continuing
Technological Advancement. Alliance will further invest in automating facilities and upgrading proprietary software.
Capitalize
on Strategic Studio Partnerships. Building on our exclusive distribution agreement with Paramount Home Entertainment through
Alliance Home Entertainment, we intend to develop additional studio partnerships to expand our footprint in the physical media market
and strengthen our position as a preferred content distribution partner.
Suppliers
Alliance
distributes and markets over 400,000 products worldwide from more than 600 of the industry’s premier physical media entertainment
products suppliers. The Company maintains approximately 340,000 SKUs of unique items in its inventory.
For
the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2025, five suppliers made up approximately 59% of product receipt value, and 11 suppliers made up
80% of product receipt value. One supplier comprised of approximately 23% of Alliance’s total product receipt value for the year
ended June 30, 2025, versus 21% in 2024.
Alliance
has written supply agreements with many of its suppliers. These agreements usually provide for nonexclusive distribution rights and often
include territorial restrictions that limit the countries and, in some cases, certain channels in which it may distribute the products.
Some of Alliance’s agreements with suppliers may contain limitations of liability with respect to our suppliers’ obligations
and warranties. Historically, warranty expenses have not been material.
The
agreements also are generally short-term, subject to annual renewal, and in some cases contain provisions permitting termination by either
party without cause upon relatively short notice. Certain supply agreements either require (at our option) or allow for the repurchase
of inventory upon termination of the agreement. In cases in which suppliers are not obligated to accept inventory returns upon termination,
some suppliers will nevertheless elect to repurchase the inventory while other suppliers will assist with either liquidation or resale
of the inventory.
Customers
Alliance
conducts business with most of the leading retailers of entertainment products and services around the world. Alliance serves a customer
base that is divided into categories including retailers, direct marketers, Internet-based resellers, independent dealers, product category
specialists and other distributors. Management believes that many of its customers are heavily dependent on Alliance as a partner with
the necessary systems, capital, inventory availability, and distribution and facilities in place to provide fulfillment and other services.
Alliance tries to reduce our exposure to the impact of business fluctuations by maintaining a balance in the customer categories we serve.
Alliance has over 4,000 customers shipping to over 35,000 storefronts and distributes to over 2,500 independent music and video retailers.
In
most cases Alliance conducts business with our customers under our general terms and conditions, without minimum purchase requirements.
It also has resale contracts with some of its reseller customers that are terminable at will after a reasonable notice period and have
no minimum purchase requirements. Alliance typically ships products on the same day it receives and accepts customers’ purchase
orders. Unless otherwise requested, substantially all of Alliance’s products are delivered by common freight carriers. Backlog
is usually not material to its business because orders are generally filled shortly after acceptance.
7
Alliance
has specific agreements in place with certain suppliers and resellers in which it provides supply chain management services such as order
management, technical support, call center services, forward and reverse logistics management, and procurement management services. These
agreements generally may be terminated by either party without cause following reasonable notice. None of the Company’s customer
contracts exceed a one-year term, with most contracts having auto-renewal clauses.
For
the year ended June 30, 2025, Alliance’s top three customers represented approximately 40% of its consolidated revenue.
Alliance’s top customer represented approximately 15% of its consolidated net sales. By comparison, for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2024, the top three customers generated approximately 39% of consolidated revenue with one customer representing approximately
18%.
Our
Business is Affected by Seasonality
Alliance
experiences some seasonal fluctuation in demand in our business due to changes in consumer behavior and schedules of new releases. In
addition, the Company typically experiences an increase in demand in the October-to-December period, driven primarily by pre-holiday
stocking levels in the retail channel for its North American business.
How
We Manage Our Inventory
Alliance
strives to maintain enough product inventories to achieve optimum order fill rates. Alliance’s business, like that of other distributors,
is subject to the risk that our inventory’s value will be adversely impacted by suppliers’ price reductions or by technological
changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the products comprising the inventory. It is the policy of many suppliers to offer
distributors limited protection from the loss in inventory value due to technological change or a supplier’s price reductions.
When protection is offered, the distributor may be restricted to a designated period of time in which products may be returned for credit
or exchanged for other products or during which price protection credits may be claimed. Alliance continually takes various actions,
including monitoring inventory levels and controlling the timing of purchases, to maximize its protection under supplier programs and
reduce inventory risk. However, no assurance can be given that current protective terms and conditions will continue or that they will
adequately protect Alliance against declines in inventory value, or that they will not be revised in such a manner as to adversely impact
Alliance’s ability to obtain price protection. Alliance is subject to the risk that inventory values may decline, and supplier
agreements may not adequately cover the decline in values. Alliance manages these risks through pricing and continual monitoring of existing
inventory levels relative to customer demand, reflecting its forecasts of future demand and market conditions. On an ongoing basis, Alliance
reduces inventory values for excess and obsolescence to assist in the liquidation of impacted inventories. Music CD’s and Video
Movies are 100% returnable back to Alliance’s suppliers. Products that have exclusive distributions for AMPED and Distribution
Solutions are not owned by Alliance and are treated as consignments for ownership and title.
Inventory
levels may vary from period to period, due, in part, to differences in actual demand from that forecasted when orders were placed, the
addition of new suppliers or new product lines with current suppliers, expansion into new product areas and strategic purchases of inventory.
In addition, payment terms with inventory suppliers may vary from time to time and could result in fewer inventories being financed by
suppliers and a greater amount of inventory being financed by our own capital. Our payment patterns can be influenced by incentives,
such as early pay discounts offered by suppliers.
Sales and Marketing
Alliance’s
product management and marketing groups help create demand for Alliance’s suppliers’ products and services, enable the launch
of new products, and facilitate customer contact. Our marketing programs are tailored to meet specific supplier and customer needs. These
needs are met through a wide offering of services by our in-house marketing organization, including advertising, market research, online
marketing, retail programs, sales promotions, training, and solutions marketing. In addition, Alliance creates and utilizes specialized
channel marketing communities to deliver focused resources and business building support to solution providers.
8
For
its Direct-to-Consumer division, the Company deploys performance marketing strategies through digital and offline channels to drive additional
traffic and transactions from high-intent prospective customers. To increase the efficiency of its performance marketing initiatives,
the Company utilizes a Customer Relationship management platform, which provides further opportunities to personalize marketing campaigns
and target advertising to specific market segments. Alliance complements its brand and performance marketing with nurture initiatives
through email and outbound communications to ensure the Company retains high-value customers, increases brand loyalty, and drives recurring
transactions.
The
Company’s marketing strategy includes brand performance, and viral marketing. Brand marketing, which may also include the Company’s
presence on social media platforms, increases awareness among potential customers, helping them understand the benefits of using Alliance’s
platforms. In addition to brand, and performance marketing, Alliance engages in traditional public relations and communications activities,
such as trade show participation, to strengthen its brand and enable it to be less reliant on performance marketing, reducing the Company’s
customer acquisition costs. The Company’s communications team works across press and policy channels to share timely and important
news about the Company. They also oversee the execution of a consumer, product, corporate, and policy communications plan that supports
Alliance’s brand strategy.
Competition
Alliance
faces competition from a variety of competitors, including some of our own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the
market, wholesale distributors, retailers, and internet-based businesses. We are a leading company in the sale and marketing of
physical media entertainment and collectible products, including vinyl, gaming, DVDs, CD’s and consumer products and toys
offerings, and operate in the competitive e-commerce business environment. We compete with several smaller physical media companies
in our product categories, as well as with many larger e-commerce companies in the United States and internationally. In addition,
we compete with entertainment companies that digitally download and stream their products. Competition is based primarily on meeting
consumer product preferences and on the quality and play value of our physical media products and experiences. To a lesser extent,
competition is also based on product pricing.
Many
of the major entertainment and gaming companies are part of large, diversified companies with a variety of other operations. Some of
these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on
pricing in order to increase entertainment revenues and streaming placement. In addition, the resources of the major entertainment producers
may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets, including media content, that we might also be interested in acquiring.
The competition we face may cause us to lose market share, achieve lower prices for our products or pay more for third party content,
any of which could harm our business.
The
changing trends in consumer preferences with respect to entertainment and collectibles and barriers to entry as well as the
emergence of new technologies and different mediums for viewing content, such as the growing number of streaming platform options,
continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups to develop products and offerings that compete with our
entertainment and e-commerce offerings. In the future, the Company may face increased competition through the emergence of new
competitors or business models. Some of Alliance’s competitors may have access to significant financial resources, greater
name recognition and well-established client bases in their target customer segments, differentiated business models, technology and
other capabilities, or a differentiated geographic coverage, which may make it more difficult for Alliance to attract new
customers.
The
market for physical media is becoming increasingly competitive as companies compete for a shrinking customer base. Distributors must
differentiate themselves by offering unique products, exclusive content, and superior customer service. The ability to quickly adapt
to market trends and consumer preferences is crucial. Specialized distributors often have an advantage in this regard, as they can be
more agile and responsive compared to larger more diverse distributors. Additionally, partnerships with artists and content creators
to secure exclusive releases can provide a unique competitive edge. As the market evolves, distributors that can innovate and meet the
demands of niche audiences will likely thrive.

Intellectual
Property
Alliance’s
intellectual property is an important component of its business. The Company relies on a combination of domain names, trademarks, copyright,
know-how and trade secrets, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions, to protect its intellectual property. As of June 30,
2025, Alliance has no active patents or patent applications, but intends to pursue patent protection to the extent it believes it would
be beneficial and cost effective.
As
of June 30, 2025, the Company owned 22 U.S. registered or pending trademarks and one registered or pending trademark in another jurisdiction.
Alliance also owns 128 domain names including www.deepdiscount.com, www.aent.com, www.cokem.com, www.importcds.com, www.ds.aent.com,
and www.AMPEDdistribution.com.
The
Company relies on trade secrets and confidential information to develop and maintain its competitive advantage. Alliance seeks to protect
its trade secrets and confidential information through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees, third
parties, and others who may have access to the Company’s proprietary information. Alliance also requires key employees to sign
invention assignment agreements with respect to inventions arising from their employment and restrict unauthorized access to the Company’s
proprietary technology.
Notwithstanding
the Company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property, there can be no assurance the measures taken will be effective or that
its intellectual property will provide any competitive advantage. Alliance can provide no assurance that any patents will be issued from
its pending applications or any future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect its proprietary technology. The
Company’s intellectual property rights may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries
do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, as a result, Alliance
may be unable to protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights in certain jurisdictions. In addition, while the Company
has confidence in the measures it takes to protect and preserve its trade secrets, it cannot guarantee these measures will not be circumvented,
or that all applicable parties have executed confidentiality or invention assignment agreements. In addition, such agreements can be
breached, and may not have adequate remedies should any such breach occur. Accordingly, Alliance’s trade secrets may otherwise
become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
Human
Capital Resources
As
of June 30, 2025, Alliance had approximately 697 employees on its payroll and approximately 168 workers hired through staffing agencies
throughout the U.S. and internationally. As of June 30, 2024, Alliance had approximately 657 employees on its payroll and approximately
226 workers hired through staffing agencies throughout the U.S. and internationally. Staffing agencies are used to flex labor capacity
to ensure the labor supply and demand are in balance. None of Alliance’s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement
and Alliance believes it has a good relationship with its employees and staffing agencies.
Employees
& Demographics. With respect to global demographics on June 30, 2025, approximately 49.5% of the Company’s payroll
employees are female and 50.5% are male.
Talent
& Turnover. With a focus on talent acquisition, the leadership team seeks out the most qualified candidates for open roles
and endeavors to keep them at Alliance. Alliance has a robust program for seeking out those candidates, which ranges from sourcing through
talent applications, reviewing direct applicants and using internal referrals to fill roles. Additionally, Alliance strives to promote
internally when possible. Alliance’s program resulted in an annualized turnover rate of about 11.4% for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2025.
Compensation
Practice & Pay Equality. As Alliance evolves and expands operations, Human Resources, in partnership with the leadership
team, will continue to evaluate the existing workforce to ensure that best practices are maintained across the entire team without risk
of inequality. Pay structures for hourly employees are reviewed annually and for all other employees, compensation is benchmarked according
to the position when a vacancy becomes available. This ensures best practices in a competitive market and, as part of that review, compensation
will be realigned where appropriate for existing employees and new hires.
10
Regulatory
Compliance
The
Company’s overall business approach and strategy includes rigorous attention to regulatory compliance, as its operations are subject
to regulations in the following principal areas, across a wide variety of jurisdictions. Alliance’s business is subject to a wide
array of laws, regulations, and standards in each domestic and foreign jurisdiction where we operate. Alliance has a buying office in
the UK and operates under the name Fulfillment Express. Fulfillment Express sources music from the UK music suppliers that is then transferred
(exported from the United Kingdom) to Kentucky where that music product is prepared to sell in the US market. Fulfillment Express makes
no sales of any kind, for it is a buying office.
The
regulatory environment in each market is often complex, evolving and can be subject to significant change. Some relevant laws and regulations
are inconsistent, ambiguous and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could adversely affect the Company’s
business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied to
an innovative hospitality provider such as Alliance, which often makes their application to its business uncertain. For additional information
regarding the laws and regulations that affect the Company’s business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Privacy
and Data Protection Regulation
In
processing purchase transactions and information about customers, the Company receives and stores a large volume of personally identifiable
data. The collection, storage, processing, transfer, use, disclosure and protection of this information are increasingly subject to legislation
and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)
and variations and implementations of that regulation in the member states of the European Union, as well as privacy and data protection
laws and regulations in various U.S. states and other jurisdictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California
Privacy Rights Act), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), and the UK General
Data Protection Regulation and the UK Data Protection Act.
Alliance
incorporates a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other procedures and protocols to protect data within the
Company’s platforms and business services, including personally identifiable data pertaining to guests and employees. Alliance
is engaged in an ongoing process of evaluating and considering additional steps to maintain compliance with the California Consumer Privacy
Act, GDPR, PIPEDA, the UK General Data Protection Regulation, and the UK Data Protection Act.
Employment
Laws
The
Company is also subject to laws governing its relationship with employees, including laws governing wages and hours, benefits, immigration
and workplace safety and health.
Other
Regulation
Alliance’s
business is subject to various other laws and regulations involving matters such as income tax and other taxes, consumer protection,
online messaging, advertising, and marketing, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws governing bribery and other corrupt
business activities, and regulations aimed at preventing money laundering or prohibiting business activities with specified countries
or persons. As the Company expands into additional markets, it will be subject to additional laws and regulations.
Periodic
Reporting and Financial Information
Our
Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and as a smaller reporting company, we have specific
reporting obligations. We file annual, quarterly, and current reports with the SEC, which include audited financial statements
prepared by our independent registered public accountants. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and
information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC (www.sec.gov). These reports
and other important information are available on our website at www.aent.com under the Investor Relations section, free of charge,
as soon as they are filed with the SEC. Please note that information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this
report.
11
We
are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such,
we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies
that are not “ emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and
shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive
as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) of 2026, (b) in which we have total
annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market
value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th,
and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References
herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally,
we currently qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under SEC regulations. This status allows us to benefit from certain
reduced disclosure obligations, such as the option to provide only two years of audited financial statements. We will continue to be
classified as a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year.

13
Risks Related to
Our Business and Industry
If
we fail to respond to or capitalize on the rapid technological development in the music, video, gaming, and entertainment industry, including
changes in entertainment delivery formats, our business could be harmed.
The
music, video, gaming, entertainment and collectible industries continue to experience frequent change driven by technological
development, including developments with respect to the formats through which music, films, television programming, games, and other
content are delivered to consumers. With rapid technological changes and dramatically expanded digital content offerings, the scale
and scope of these changes have accelerated in recent years. For example, consumers are increasingly accessing television, film, and
other episodic content on streaming and digital content networks, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+ and Apple TV+.
Additionally, consumers access music content through Apple Music, Pandora, Amazon Music, Spotify, and other providers. Video game
services can be accessed through Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Now, GeForce, Steam, Stadia, xCloud, Shadow, Luna, and Switch
Online.
Some
entertainment offerings have gone direct to streaming channels and have not produced a physical content format. Direct release to streaming
channels is likely to continue. Technological as well as other changes caused by the pandemic have caused significant disruption to the
retail distribution of music and entertainment offerings and have caused and could in the future cause a negative impact on sales of
our products and other forms of monetization of content. We may lose opportunities to capitalize on changing market dynamics, technological
innovations, or consumer tastes if we do not adapt our content offerings or distribution capabilities in a timely manner. The overall
effect that technological development and new digital distribution platforms have on the revenue and profits we derive from our entertainment
content, including from merchandise sales derived from such content, and the additional costs associated with changing markets, media
platforms and technologies, is unpredictable. If we fail to accurately assess and effectively respond to changes in technology and consumer
behavior in the entertainment industry, our business may be harmed.
If
we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment network, our business could be harmed.
If
we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network successfully, it could result
in excess or insufficient fulfillment, or result in increased costs, impairment charges, or both, and harm our business in other ways.
As we continue to add fulfillment or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment networks become increasingly complex
and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively. In addition,
a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network could result in lost sales from under inventory positions or extra costs of
holding excess inventory or write-downs on inventory. Due to tight labor markets, we may be unable to staff our fulfillment network and
customer service centers adequately or must increase wages to attract more employees.
We
rely on several shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and complete orders to our customers. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable
terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results
and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also
may be negatively affected by inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, acts
of God, and similar factors.
Under
some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory
and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately
forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.
14
We face competition. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors,
our revenues, market share and profitability could decline
Our
businesses are rapidly evolving and competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including physical, e-commerce,
and omni-channel retail, e-commerce services, digital content and electronic devices, web and infrastructure computing services, and
transportation and logistics services, and across geographies, including cross-border competition. Some of our current and potential
competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition. They may also secure better terms
from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.
The
music, video, gaming, and entertainment industry is highly competitive. We compete in the U.S. and internationally with a wide array
of large and small distributors, and sellers of vinyl records, CD’s, DVD’s, video games and other entertainment and consumer
products. In addition, we compete with companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories,
including through entertainment offerings. Across our business, we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate
consumer tastes and trends, seeking which will appeal to consumers, and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer
acceptance and purchase.
The
market for physical media is becoming increasingly competitive as companies compete for a shrinking customer base. Distributors must
differentiate themselves by offering unique products, exclusive content, and superior customer service. To be successful, we must correctly
anticipate the types of entertainment, products and play patterns which will capture consumers’ interests and imagination, and
quickly develop and introduce innovative products and engaging entertainment which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited
time, attention, and spending. Specialized distributors often have an advantage in this regard, as they can be more agile and responsive
compared to larger more diverse distributors. Additionally, partnerships with artists and content creators to secure exclusive releases
can provide a unique competitive edge. As the market evolves, distributors that can innovate and meet the demands of niche audiences
will likely thrive.
Competition
is likely to continue intensifying, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors,
as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances, and established companies in other market segments expand to become
competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, digital content, and electronic devices,
are likely to continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased
competition may reduce our sales and profits.
Disruptions
in Alliance’s supply chain have increased product expenditures and could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.
The
occurrence of one or more natural or human induced disasters, including pandemic diseases or viral contagions such as the COVID-19 pandemic;
geopolitical events, such as war, civil unrest attacks in a country in which Alliance’s suppliers are located; and the imposition
of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade could result in disruption of Alliance’s
logistics or supply chain network. For example, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the operations of Alliance and its suppliers
and customers. Customer demand for certain products has also fluctuated during the pandemic which challenged Alliance’s ability
to anticipate and/or procure product to maintain inventory levels to meet that demand. Additionally supply chain disruptions can be the
result of the bankruptcy or failure of trucking and other logistics businesses. Labor shortages can also cause supply chain disruptions.
These
factors have resulted in higher product inventory cost positions in certain products as well as delays in delivering those products to
Alliance’s distribution centers, branches or customers, and similar results may occur in the future. Even when Alliance is able
to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require Alliance to incur higher transportation costs, which could
adversely impact Alliance’s profitability and financial condition. Any of these circumstances could impair Alliance’s ability
to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, penalties, or damage to Alliance’s
reputation. Any such increased product costs from supplier disruption could adversely impact the results of operations and financial
performance.
15
Inflation
may continue to cause Alliance’s product costs and operating and administrative expenses to grow more rapidly than net sales, which
could result in lower gross margins and lower net earnings.
Market
variables, such as inflation of product costs from suppliers, labor rates and fuel, freight and energy costs, have and may continue to
increase potentially causing Alliance to be unable to efficiently manage its product costs and operating and administrative expenses
in a way that would enable it to leverage its revenue growth into higher net earnings. In addition, Alliance’s inability to pass
on such increases in product costs to customers in a timely manner, or at all, could cause Alliance’s operating and administrative
expenses to grow, which could result in lower gross profit margins and lower net earnings.
Weakness
in the economy, market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of Alliance’s customers
could negatively impact Alliance’s sales growth and results of operations.
Economic,
political and industry trends affect Alliance’s business environments. Unfavorable conditions in the economy in the United States
and abroad may negatively affect the growth of our business and have affected our results of operations. For example, macroeconomic events,
including inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical issues, have led to economic uncertainty globally. Alliance serves
several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending
and demand for products and services of Alliance’s customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to cyclical
fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty, trade and tariff policies, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, central bank
interest rate fluctuations, economic downturns, recessions, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices,
geopolitical developments, labor shortages, inflation, natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, outbreaks of pandemic disease
such as the COVID 19 pandemic, inflation, deflation, and a variety of other factors beyond Alliance’s control. Any of these factors
could cause customers to idle or close stores, delay purchases, reduce wholesale purchasing levels, or experience reductions in the demand
for their own retail and wholesale products or services.
Any
of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from Alliance or impair the ability of
Alliance’s customers to make full and timely payments and could cause increased pressure on Alliance’s selling prices and
terms of sale.
If
we incurred any significant impairment charges, our net earnings would be reduced.
Declines
in the profitability of acquired brands or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the
carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Similarly, declines in our profitability may impact on
the fair value of our reporting unit, which could result in a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our net earnings.
Risks
Related to Expansion of our Business
Our
expansion places a strain on our management, operational, financial, and other resources.
We
are rapidly and significantly expanding operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure
to support our retail and services businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places strain on our management,
personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We
may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating
results.
We
may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in our acquisitions or joint ventures, or those benefits may
be delayed or reduced in their realization.
Acquisitions
and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business, such as our acquisition of Hand Made by Robots
in December 2024 and COKeM in September 2020. Acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings and product offerings and allow
us to build additional capabilities and competencies of the company.
16
We
cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity
with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to market our products more effectively,
develop our competencies or grow our business. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into
our operations will create production, marketing and other operating, revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth
and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies, and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that
these synergies, efficiencies, and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their
realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case
we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key
talented individuals at these companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will develop popular and profitable
products, entertainment, or services in the future. We cannot guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful
or beneficial, and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact
other aspects of our business.
Our
expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional business, legal, financial, and
competitive risks.
We
may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, including collectibles, and our customers may not adopt our
offerings. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of
these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer
activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our
investments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our
operating results.
We
may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate.
We
may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant
portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less
than expected.
Our
revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends
on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our customers, and our business is affected by general
economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of
the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.
Our
sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and
the following:
●
our
ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands;
●
our
ability to retain and expand our network of customers;
●
our
ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;
●
the
introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;
●
changes
in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;
●
timing,
effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;
●
the
success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;
17
●
the
extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;
●
the
outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material
adverse impact on our operating results;
●
variations
in the mix of products and services we sell;
●
variations
in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;
●
the
extent to which we offer free shipping, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;
●
factors
affecting our reputation or brand image;
●
the
extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories;
●
increases
in the prices of fuel and gasoline, as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing
supplies;
●
the
extent to which our equity-method investees record significant operating and non-operating items;
●
the
extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired
and unconstrained access to our online services;
●
our
ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;
●
the
extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data
theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events;
●
terrorist
attacks and armed hostilities;
●
supply
chain issues either in chip shortages; and
●
long
lead time in the manufacturing vinyl LP’s.
Our
international operations expose us to a number of risks.
Our
international activities are insignificant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international
market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise
succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations, and promote our brand internationally. Our international
operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis.
In
addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
●
local
economic and political conditions;
●
government
regulation and compliance requirements (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition), restrictive
governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs), nationalization,
and restrictions on foreign ownership;
18
●
restrictions
on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content,
including uncertainty as a result of less Internet- friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules,
regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property
rights;
●
business
licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;
●
limitations
on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;
●
limited
fulfillment and technology infrastructure;
●
shorter
payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;
●
laws
and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing
or discounts;
●
lower
levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;
●
lower
levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;
●
difficulty
in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences.
●
different
employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;
●
compliance
with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government
officials and other third parties;
●
laws
and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and
●
geopolitical
events, including war and terrorism.
As
international physical, e-commerce, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business
models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local
customer, as well as their more established local brand names. We may not be able to hire, train, retain, and manage required personnel,
which may limit our international growth.
Our
business will suffer if we are not successful in developing and expanding our partner brands across our consumer base.
Our
strategy is to focus and expand larger global brands with an emphasis on developing and expanding those of our key partner brands, which
we view as having the largest global potential across our customer base. As we concentrate our efforts on more brands, we believe we
can gain additional leverage and enhance the consumer experience. This focus means that our success depends disproportionately on our
and our new partners’ ability to successfully develop these new brands across our consumer base and to maintain and extend the
reach and relevance of these brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets. This strategy has required us to acquire, build,
invest in and develop our competencies in music, movies, gaming, consumer products and entertainment products. Acquiring, developing,
investing in, and growing these competencies has required significant effort, time and money, with no assurance of success. The success
of our brand blueprint strategy also requires significant alignment and integration among our business segments. If we are unable to
successfully develop, maintain and expand key partner brands across our brand blueprint, our business performance will suffer.
19
Risks
Related to Shifts in Consumer Demand
Consumer
interests change rapidly, and acceptance of products and entertainment offerings are influenced by outside factors.
The
interests of families, individuals, fans, and audiences evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year and by
geography. To be successful, we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment, products and play patterns which will capture consumers’
interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products and engaging entertainment which can compete successfully
for consumers’ limited time, attention, and spending. This challenge is more difficult with the ever-increasing utilization of
technology, social media, and digital media in entertainment offerings, and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers.
Evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests, coupled with an ever-changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties
and products that compete for consumer interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products and entertainment offerings
can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other products and entertainment offerings can be popular during a certain period of time
but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, our products and entertainment offerings can have short consumer life cycles.
Consumer
acceptance of our or our partners’ entertainment offerings is also affected by outside factors, such as critical reviews,
promotions, the quality and acceptance of films and television programs, music, video games, collectibles and content released into
the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities,
general economic conditions and public tastes generally, all of which could change rapidly and most of which are beyond our control.
There can be no assurance that television programs and films, video games, video movies and collectibles we distribute will obtain
favorable reviews or ratings, that films, video games, video movies we distribute will be popular with consumers and perform well in
our distribution channels.
If
we devote time and resources to distributing and marketing products or entertainment that consumers do not accept or do not find interesting
enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us, our revenues and profits may decline, and our business performance may
be harmed. Similarly, if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests, our revenues and earnings
will be reduced.
An
inability to develop, introduce and ship planned products, product lines and new brands in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage
our business.
In
acquiring new products, product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions. When
we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product, product line or brand at a certain time in the future
those expectations are based on completing the associated development, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently
anticipated development schedule. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to source and ship new or continuing products in a timely
manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands.
The
risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are distributing, providing greater innovation and
product differentiation. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development,
or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than
anticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction
to be discontinued.
20
Risks
Related to Our Supply Chain and Sales Channels
Disruptions
or inefficiencies in our supply chain or logistics network could adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer demand and may increase
our costs.
While
global supply chain conditions have generally stabilized compared to the disruptions experienced in 2021 and 2022, we continue to face
certain logistical and cost-related challenges, including fluctuating freight rates, labor shortages in transportation and warehousing,
and longer lead times for certain products sourced internationally.
Although
we have implemented strategies to mitigate these risks—such as diversifying our supplier base, leveraging alternative shipping
methods, and negotiating improved carrier terms, there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient in the event of renewed
disruption, geopolitical instability, or macroeconomic pressures.
If
we are unable to effectively manage shipping logistics, maintain adequate inventory levels, or adjust pricing in response to cost increases,
we may not be able to meet customer demand or sustain our margins. Any prolonged disruption or cost pressure in our supply chain could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
If
we are unable to adapt our business to the continued shift to e-commerce, our business may be harmed.
In
fiscal year 2025, ecommerce sales represented approximately 45% of our top four customers overall sales as consumers increasingly purchased
our products online as compared to through in-store shopping. Ecommerce sales have resulted in retailers holding less inventory,
which has caused us to adjust our supply chain. This supply chain is further strained by customers desiring faster delivery at reduced
costs. Additionally, if our technology and systems used to support ecommerce order processing are not effective, our ability to deliver
products on time on a cost-effective basis may be adversely affected. Failure to continue to adapt our systems and supply chain and successfully
fulfill ecommerce sales could harm our business.
The
concentration of our retail customer base and continued shift to ecommerce sales means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing
or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us.
For
the year ended June 30, 2025, our top three customers generated approximately 40% of our net sales, and our largest customer accounted
for approximately 15% of our total net sales. For the year ended June 30,
2024, our top customer accounted for 18% of total net sales.
Due to our customer concentration, if our top customer was to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations
to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, change
their purchasing patterns, impose unexpected fees on us, alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote
to promoting and selling our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, our business may be harmed.
Our
customers do not make binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders.
Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries, and
the shelf space allotted for our products. In addition, increased concentration among our customers could negatively impact our ability
to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were
less consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, the failure or lack of success of a significant retail customer could negatively
impact our revenues and profitability.
21
Our
business, including our costs and supply chain, is subject to risks associated with sourcing, manufacturing, warehousing, distribution
and logistics, and the loss of any of our key suppliers or service providers could negatively impact our business.
All
the products we offer are manufactured by third-party labels, studios, publishers, and suppliers, and as a result we may be subject to
price fluctuations or demand disruptions. Our operating results would be negatively impacted by increases in the costs of the products
we offer, and we have no guarantees that costs will not rise. In addition, as we expand into new categories and product types, we expect
that we may not have strong purchasing power in these new areas, which could lead to higher costs than we have historically seen in our
current categories. We may not be able to pass increased costs on to consumers, which could adversely affect our operating results. Moreover,
in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the materials used in the manufacture of the products we offer, we and the
vendors that we work with might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price.
In
addition, products, and merchandise we receive from manufacturers and suppliers may not be of sufficient quality or free from damage,
or such products may be damaged during shipping, while stored in our warehouse fulfillment centers or with third-party ecommerce or retail
customers or when returned by consumers. We may incur additional expenses, and our reputation could be harmed if consumers and potential
consumers believe that our products do not meet their expectations, are not properly labeled or are damaged.
We
purchase significant amounts from a limited number of suppliers with limited supply capabilities. There can be no assurance that our
current suppliers will be able to accommodate our anticipated growth or continue to supply current quantities at preferential prices.
An inability of our existing suppliers to provide products in a timely or cost-effective manner could impair our growth and have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We generally do not maintain long-term supply contracts
with any of our suppliers and any of our suppliers could discontinue selling to us at any time. The loss of any of our other significant
suppliers, or the discontinuance of any preferential pricing or exclusive incentives they currently offer to us could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
We
continually seek to expand our base of product suppliers, especially as we identify new markets. We also require our new and existing
suppliers to meet our ethical and business partner standards. Suppliers may also have to meet governmental and industry standards and
any relevant standards required by our consumers, which may require additional investment and time on behalf of suppliers and us. If
any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent, ceases, or significantly reduces its operations or experiences financial distress, or if
any environmental, economic or other outside factors impact their operations. If we are unable to identify or enter distribution relationships
with new suppliers or to replace the loss of any of our existing suppliers, we may experience a competitive disadvantage, our business
may be disrupted and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.
Our
principal suppliers currently provide us with certain incentives such as extended payment terms, volume purchasing, trade discounts,
cooperative advertising, and market development funds. A reduction or discontinuance of these incentives would increase our costs and
could reduce our ability to achieve or maintain profitability. Similarly, if one or more of our suppliers were to offer these incentives,
including preferential pricing, to our competitors, our competitive advantage would be reduced, which could have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
22
We
face significant inventory risk.
In
addition to risks described elsewhere relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed
to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid
changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer
tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking
or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory
or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult
to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition
of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment, and they may not be returnable. We carry a
broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities
or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. If our inventory forecasting and production planning processes result in higher
inventory levels exceeding the levels demanded by customers or should our customers decrease their orders with us, our operating results
could be adversely affected due to costs of carrying the inventory and additional inventory write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory.
Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.
If
our third-party suppliers’ labels, studios, and publishers do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, our reputation,
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed.
Our
reputation and our consumers’ willingness to purchase our products depend in part on our suppliers’ labels, studios, publishers,
and other suppliers, and retail partners’ compliance with ethical employment practices, such as with respect to child labor, wages
and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, safe and healthy working conditions, and with all legal and regulatory requirements relating
to the conduct of their businesses. We do not exercise control over our suppliers, manufacturers, and retail partners and cannot guarantee
their compliance with ethical and lawful business practices. If our suppliers, manufacturers, or retail partners fail to comply with
applicable laws, regulations, safety codes, employment practices, human rights standards, quality standards, environmental standards,
production practices, or other obligations, norms, or ethical standards, our reputation and brand image could be harmed, and we could
be exposed to litigation, investigations, enforcement actions, monetary liability, and additional costs that would harm our reputation,
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Shipping
is a critical part of our business and any changes in our shipping arrangements or any interruptions in shipping could adversely affect
our operating results.
We
primarily rely on the major suppliers for our shipping requirements. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable pricing and other terms
with these suppliers or if one of the two experiences performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating
results and our consumer or retail partner experience. Shipping vendors may also impose shipping surcharges from time to time. In addition,
our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship products to consumers and retailers may be negatively affected by inclement
weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, trade embargoes, customs and tax requirements
and similar factors. For example, strikes at major international shipping ports have in the past impacted our supply of inventory from
our third-party labels, studios, publishers, and suppliers, and the escalating trade dispute between the United States and China has
and may in the future lead to increased tariffs, the revocation of current tariff exclusions for certain of our products, which may restrict
the flow of the goods from China to the United States. We are also subject to risks of damage or loss during delivery by our shipping
vendors. If our products are not delivered in a timely fashion or are damaged or lost during the delivery process, our consumers could
become dissatisfied and cease shopping on our site or retailer or third-party ecommerce sites, which could have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.
23
We
are subject to risks related to online payment methods, including third-party payment processing-related risks.
We
currently accept payments using a variety of methods, including checks, ACH, wire transfers, credit card, debit card, PayPal, and gift
cards. As we offer new payment options to consumers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements, fraud, and
other risks. We also rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, and for certain payment methods, we pay interchange
and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and affect our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.
We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard, or PCI-DSS, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult
or impossible for us to comply. If we (or a third-party processing payment card transactions on our behalf) suffer a security breach
affecting payment card information, we may have to pay onerous and significant fines, penalties and assessments arising out of the major
card brands’ rules and regulations, contractual indemnifications or liability contained in merchant agreements and similar contracts,
and we may lose our ability to accept payment cards for payment for our goods and services, which could materially impact our operations
and financial performance.
Furthermore,
as our business changes, we may be subject to different rules under existing standards, which may require new assessments that involve
costs above what we currently pay for compliance. As we offer new payment options to consumers, including by way of integrating emerging
mobile and other payment methods, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud. If we fail to comply
with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, if the volume of fraud in our transactions limits or terminates
our rights to use payment methods we currently accept, or if a data breach occurs relating to our payment systems, we may, among other
things, be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit card
payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments.
We
also occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent data and we may ultimately be held liable for the unauthorized use of a cardholder’s
card number in an illegal activity and be required by card issuers to pay charge-back fees. Charge-backs result not only in our loss
of fees earned with respect to the payment, but also leave us liable for the underlying money transfer amount. If our chargeback rate
becomes excessive, card associations also may require us to pay fines or refuse to process our transactions. To mitigate credit card
fraud, we use Kount to score all credit card orders for risk of fraud. In addition, we may be subject to additional fraud risk if third-party
service providers or our employees fraudulently use consumer information for their own gain or facilitate the fraudulent use of such
information. Overall, we may have little recourse if we process a criminally fraudulent transaction. If any of these events were to occur,
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.
We
rely on third-party suppliers, labels, studios, publishers, suppliers, retail and ecommerce partners and other vendors, and they may
not continue to produce products or provide services that are consistent with our standards or applicable regulatory requirements, which
could harm our brand, cause consumer dissatisfaction, and require us to find alternative suppliers of our products or services.
We
do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We use multiple third-party suppliers and labels, studios, publishers, suppliers
based primarily in the United States, China and Mexico and other countries to a lesser extent, to manufacture and supply all the products
we offer and sell.
We
engage many of our third-party suppliers and labels, studios, publishers, suppliers on a purchase order basis and in most cases are not
party to long-term contracts with them. The ability and willingness of these third parties to supply and manufacture the products we
offer, and sell may be affected by competing orders placed by other companies and the demands of those companies. If we experience significant
increases in demand or need to replace a significant number of existing suppliers or manufacturers, there can be no assurance that additional
supply and manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier
or manufacturer will allocate sufficient capacity to us to meet our requirements. Furthermore, our reliance on suppliers and manufacturers
outside of the United States, the number of third parties with whom we transact and the number of jurisdictions to which we sell complicates
our efforts to comply with customs duties and excise taxes; any failure to comply could adversely affect our business. In addition, quality
control problems, such as the use of materials and delivery of products that do not meet our quality control standards and specifications
or comply with applicable laws or regulations, could harm our business. Quality control problems could result in regulatory action, such
as restrictions on importation, products of inferior quality or product stock outages or shortages, harming our sales and creating inventory
write-downs for unusable products.
24
We
have also outsourced minute portions of our fulfillment process, as well as certain technology-related functions, to third-party service
providers. Specifically, we are dependent on third-party vendors for credit card processing, and we use third-party hosting and networking
providers to host our sites. The failure of one or more of these entities to provide the expected services on a timely basis, or at all,
or at the prices we expect, or the costs and disruption incurred in changing these outsourced functions to being performed under our
management and direct control or that of a third party, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.
We
are party to short-term contracts with some of our retail and ecommerce partners, and upon expiration of these existing agreements, we
may not be able to renegotiate the terms on a commercially reasonable basis, or at all.
Further,
our third-party labels, studios, publishers, suppliers and retail and ecommerce partners may:

Risks
Related to Our Debt
Alliance’s
existing and any future indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to operate its business.
On
December 31, 2023, the Company as Parent and Guarantor, certain of its subsidiaries from time to time party thereto, as Borrowers and/or
Guarantors, White Oak Commercial Finance, LLC, as administrative agent, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto, entered
into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which provides for a $120 million senior secured revolving credit
facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility matures on December 21, 2026 (the “Revolving
Credit Facility Maturity Date”). As of June 30, 2025, the Company had approximately $57 million outstanding under the Revolving
Credit facility (see Note 8 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)
25
Borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the 30-day SOFR rate, subject to a floor rate of 2.00%, plus a margin of 4.5% to
4.75%, depending on the level of the Company’s utilization of the facility and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. The effective
interest rate for the period from execution of the Revolving Credit Facility through June 30, 2025 and 2024, was 9.25% and 9.5% respectively.
On
June 30, 2025, the Company entered into an amendment to which reduced the applicable interest rate
margin from a range of 4.5% – 4.75% to a range of 4.0% – 4.25%, effective immediately. The Company expects the reduction
in the applicable interest rate range to decrease its interest expense in future periods.
The
Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest on the Company’s and the borrowers’ and other guarantors’
cash, accounts receivable, books and records and related assets. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains certain financial
covenants, financial reporting requirements and affirmative covenants with which the Company is required to comply.
A
breach of the covenants under the Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default
may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration
or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Facility could permit the lenders under the Credit
Agreement to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the Credit Agreement. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the
amounts due and payable under the Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that
indebtedness. In the event our lender accelerates the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.
The
Revolving Credit Facility also includes an unused commitment fee of 0.25%. Upon the reduction or termination of the commitments under
the Revolving Credit Facility prior to the Revolving Credit Facility Maturity Date, the Company will be required to pay an early termination
fee of 2.0% if reduced or terminated prior to December 21, 2024, or 1.0% if reduced or terminated after December 21, 2024 but before
August 21, 2025 plus an amount of minimum interest if reduced or terminated on or prior to June 21, 2025. The Company did not reduce or terminate the facility, and as of June 30, 2025, the early termination fee provisions
had expired. The Company remains subject to the unused commitment fee.
Availability
under the Revolving Credit Facility is limited by formula based on eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory, subject to adjustment
at the discretion of the lenders.
Alliance’s
outstanding indebtedness, including any additional indebtedness beyond our borrowings under the Credit Agreement, combined with its other
financial obligations and contractual commitments could have significant adverse consequences, including:
●
Requiring
us to dedicate a portion of our cash resources to the payment of interest and principal, reducing money available to fund working
capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, international expansion, new product development, new enterprise relationships
and other general corporate purposes;
●
Increasing
our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and market conditions;
●
Subjecting
us to restrictive covenants that may reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions or obtain further debt or equity financing;
●
Limiting
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and
●
Placing
us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options.
We
intend to satisfy our current and future debt service obligations with our then existing cash. However, we may not have sufficient funds
and may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay the amounts due under the Revolving Credit Facility or any other debt instruments.
Failure to make payments or comply with other covenants under our existing credit facility or such other debt instruments could result
in an event of default and acceleration of amounts due, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
26
A
breach of the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such
a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration
or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility could permit the lenders under
the Revolving Credit Facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. Furthermore,
if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Revolving Credit Facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral
granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lender accelerates the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient
assets to repay that indebtedness.
Covenants
and events of default under Alliance’s Credit Facility could limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions and adversely
affect our liquidity.
A
breach of the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such
a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration
or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility could permit the lenders under
the Revolving Credit Facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. Furthermore,
if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Revolving Credit Facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral
granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lender accelerates the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient
assets to repay that indebtedness.
Government
efforts to combat inflation, along with other interest rate pressures arising from an inflationary economic environment, could lead to
us to incur even higher interest rates and financing costs.
Inflation
has risen on a global basis, the United States has been experiencing historically high levels of inflation, and government entities have
taken various actions to combat inflation, such as raising interest rate benchmarks. Government entities may continue their efforts,
or implement additional efforts, to combat inflation, which could include among other things continuing to raise interest rate benchmarks
and/or maintaining interest rate benchmarks at elevated levels. Such government efforts, along with other interest rate pressures arising
from an inflationary economic environment, could lead to us to incur even higher interest rates and financing costs on our Credit Agreement
with White Oak Commercial Financing, LLC. and have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our
indebtedness may limit our availability of cash, cause us to divert cash to fund debt service payments or make it more difficult to take
certain other actions.
We
operate the business with an asset-based line of credit to fund working capital to support our Accounts Payable and our Inventory purchases.
●
make
it more difficult and/or costly for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due, particularly during adverse economic and
industry conditions, because a decrease in revenues or increase in costs could cause cash flow from operations to be insufficient
to make scheduled debt service payments;
●
require
a substantial portion of our available cash to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, acquisitions or other strategic opportunities, dividend payments,
share repurchases and other general corporate purposes;
●
make
it more difficult for us to raise capital to fund working capital, make capital expenditures, pay dividends, pursue strategic initiatives
or for other purposes and result in higher interest expense, which could be further increased in case of current or future borrowings
subject to variable rates of interest;
●
require
that materially adverse terms, conditions, or covenants be placed on us under our debt instruments, which could include, for example,
limitations on additional borrowings or limitations on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or
make investments, any of which could hinder our access to capital markets or our flexibility in the conduct of our business and make
us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive industry conditions; and
●
jeopardize
our ability to pay our indebtedness if our business experienced a severe downturn.
27
If
we were unable to obtain or service our other external financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome,
our business would be harmed.
Due
to the seasonal nature of our business, to meet our working capital needs, we rely on a revolving credit agreement that provides for
a $120,000,000 committed revolving asset-based loan Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain restrictive
covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment-grade facility. These
restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial, operating, and strategic flexibility.
Not
only may our financial performance impact our ability to access external financing sources, but significant disruptions to credit markets
in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the credit markets,
it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation,
it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative
sources of funding.
We
also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to issue such securities
on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit
rating agencies, market interest rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering. The
condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in
the future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest
rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability
to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities.
If
we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt, we would need to refinance our outstanding
debt or face default. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all.
Risks
Related to our Management
Our
success is dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees.
Our
officers and employees are at the heart of all our efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hard work that drive our success. We compete
with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring, and retaining our management team and our many other skilled officers and
employees around the world. The increasing prevalence of remote work creates further challenges in retaining employees as some employees
desire more flexibility in their employment and the ability to work remotely opens more employment opportunities. The impact of failing
to retain key employees can be high due to loss of key knowledge and relationships, loss of creative talent, lost productivity, hiring
and training costs, all of which could result in lower profitability. We cannot guarantee that we will recruit, hire, or retain the key
personnel we need to succeed.
Our
future success also depends on the continued leadership of key executives, including Mr. Bruce Ogilvie, our Executive Chairman, and Mr.
Jeff Walker, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of any key members of our management team, including Mr. Ogilvie
and Mr. Walker, or the failure to attract and retain talented individuals with the necessary skill sets for our diverse and evolving
business could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial results. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully recruit,
hire, or retain the personnel essential to our success.
28
If
we fail to develop diverse top talent, we may be unable to compete, and our business may be harmed.
To
compete successfully, we must continuously develop a diverse group of talented people. We promote a diverse and inclusive work environment.
To that end, we have set goals and objectives with respect to hiring and retention of talented, diverse employees, who we believe will
foster new ideas and perspectives that will benefit our business. Competition for diverse talent is intense. We cannot guarantee we will
achieve our goals or that our actions will result in expected benefits to our business.
Alliance
has engaged in transactions with related parties, and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse
effect on our business and results of operations.
Alliance
has entered into transactions with related parties, including our two principal stockholders. We have entered into transactions with
companies owned by Bruce Ogilvie and Jeffrey Walker, including GameFly Holdings, LLC. For the year ended June 30, 2025, and 2024, Alliance
made sales of new release movies, video games, and video game consoles to GameFly Holdings LLC in the amount of $2.7 million and $8.4
million, respectively. GameFly, a customer of Alliance, is equally owned by Bruce Ogilvie and Jeff Walker, the two shareholders of Alliance.
Alliance believes the amounts payable to GameFly are at fair market value. Although the agreement between Alliance and GameFly can be
terminated by either party at any time, given Mr. Ogilvie’s and Mr. Walker’s positions with Alliance as Executive Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, respectively. We may in the future enter into additional transactions with entities
in which majority shareholders, executive officers and members of our board of directors and other related parties hold ownership interests.
See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”
Transactions
with such related parties present potential for conflicts of interest, as the interests of the third-party owned related entity and its
shareholders may not align with the interests of our stockholders with respect to the negotiation of, and certain other matters. For
example, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions regarding the structure and terms of the GameFly contract, contractual
remedies, events of default and dealings with customers.
Pursuant
to our related party transactions policy, all additional material related party transactions that we enter require either (i) the unanimous
consent of our audit committee or (ii) the approval of a majority of the members of our board of directors. See “Certain Relationships
and Related Party Transactions — Policies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions.” Nevertheless, we may have achieved
more favorable terms if such transactions had not been entered into with related parties and these transactions, individually or in the
aggregate, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations or may result in government enforcement actions or other
litigation.
29
Risks
Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property
Our
business may be harmed if we are unable to protect our critical intellectual property rights.
Our
intellectual property, including our trademarks and tradenames, copyrights, patents, and rights under our license agreements and other
agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of critical
value. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent, and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights
to valuable intellectual property in the U.S. and around the world. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the
future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property in the U.S. and around the world. In addition, our business is subject
to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights, as well as the risk of unauthorized
third parties copying and distributing our entertainment content or leaking portions of planned entertainment content. We may need to
resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.
Similarly, third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products, productions, or other intellectual property. Our failure
to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position.
Failure
to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales
or profitability.
We
rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business, including
product development, management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, royalty and financial reporting and various other
processes and transactions. We are critically dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related
back-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer
viruses, malware and other cybersecurity breaches, catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, acts
of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees or partners. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends
on these information systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new
technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems or third-party hosted
technology to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significant
capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability.
If
our electronic data is compromised, our business could be significantly harmed.
We
and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the United States and in the cloud.
This data relates to all aspects of our business, including current and future products and entertainment under development, and also
contains certain customer, consumer, supplier, partner and employee data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this
data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion, cyber-attacks or tampering that could compromise the
integrity and privacy of this data. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication, and intensity, and are becoming
increasingly difficult to detect. They are often carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled, and persistent actors, including
nation states, organized crime groups, “hacktivists” and employees or contractors acting with malicious intent. Cyber-attacks
could include the deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, ransomware, a denial-of-service attack, a malicious website, the use
of social engineering and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology systems and data. Cyber-attacks
could also include supply chain attacks, which could cause a delay in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we provide confidential
and proprietary information to our third-party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business.
While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable,
that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties, those partners may also be subject to data intrusion
or otherwise compromise the protection of such data. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, consumers, suppliers,
partners, employees or ourselves, or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information
technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, consumers, employees and other business
partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations, subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities
and result in a loss of business that could be material.
30
Risks
Related to Matters Outside our Control That May Impact Our Business
Risks
Related to International Trade Policies and Tariffs
We
are subject to risks arising from changes in international trade policies, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs on imported
goods. These risks are particularly relevant to our gaming and collectibles categories, where a significant portion of our inventory
is sourced from foreign suppliers.
There
have recently been significant changes to international trade policies and tariffs affecting imports and exports. Any significant increases
in tariffs on goods or materials or other changes in trade policy could negatively affect our search for a target and/or our ability
to complete
a
business combination.
Recently,
the U.S. has implemented a range of new tariffs and increases to existing tariffs. In response to the tariffs announced by the U.S.,
other countries have imposed, are considering imposing and may in the future impose new or increased tariffs on certain exports from
the United States. There is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries
with respect to trade policies, taxes, government regulations and tariffs, and we cannot predict whether and to what extent current tariffs
will continue or trade policies will change in the future.
Tariffs,
the threat of tariffs or increases in tariffs, could materially increase our cost of goods sold. While we may be able to offset some
of these increases through price adjustments, there is no guarantee that market conditions will support such increases without negatively
affecting consumer demand. In some cases, higher retail prices could increase revenues, but these effects are uncertain and highly dependent
on our ability to maintain price elasticity and competitive positioning in the marketplace.
If
we are unable to pass through increased costs or if supply chain disruptions prevent us from sourcing key products, our business, financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
Adverse
economic conditions in the markets in which we and our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers, and manufacturers operate could negatively
impact our ability to produce and ship our products, and lower our revenues, margins and profitability.
Various
economic conditions in the markets we, our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers, and manufacturers operate, could have a significant
negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business. The occurrence of adverse economic conditions can result in manufacturing
and other work stoppages, slowdowns, and delays; shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials; delays or
reduced purchases from customers and consumers; and other factors that cause increases in costs or delay in revenues. Inflation, such
as what consumers in the U.S. and other economies are experiencing, can cause significant increases in the costs of other products which
are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary products
and entertainment we offer. Weakened economic conditions, higher interest rates, lowered employment levels or recessions may also significantly
reduce consumer purchases of our products and spending on entertainment. Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist
attacks, wars, and other conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, natural disasters, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs,
or the prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate,
could significantly harm our revenues and profitability.
Our
success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell those products
at costs which allow us to make a profit. Rising fuel and raw material prices, due to inflation or otherwise, for paperboard and other
components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components, increased transportation and shipping costs, and increased labor
costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products,
which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm our business.
Changes
in U.S., global or regional economic conditions could harm our business and financial performance.
Our
financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate. Reductions in stimulus
payments provided to consumers, high inflation and rising interest rates on credit cards could impact discretionary spending. Recessions,
credit crises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit and financial markets in the U.S. and in other markets in which
we operate can result in lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer
confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can
lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase
of our products and entertainment. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability.
Our
global operations mean we transact business in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies. As a result, if the exchange
rate between the U.S. dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes,
our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly
affected. Similarly, our expenses can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of
our business in U.S. dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control. Depreciation in key
currencies may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in U.S. dollars.
31
Our
quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality in our business and union strikes impacting the availability
of content.
Sales
of our music, video movies, video games and other entertainment products are seasonal, with an increase of retail sales occurring during
the period from October through December for the holiday season. This seasonality for our consumer products business has increased over
time, as retailers become more and more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response or just in time inventory
management techniques, including the use of automated inventory replenishment programs. Further, ecommerce continues to grow significantly
and accounts for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers. Ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory
and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers. As a result, customers are timing their orders
so that they are being fulfilled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. While these techniques reduce
a retailer’s investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant
portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier. This can also result in our losing significant revenues and earnings if
our supply chain is unable to supply product to our customers when they want it.
The
level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or our customers
determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to procure
and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand. Additionally, the logistics of supplying more product within shorter
time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales
and harm our financial performance.
Our
entertainment business is also subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of music, television, film, gaming content releases.
Release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of holiday periods, geographical release dates and competition
in the market.
This
seasonal pattern of our business requires significant use of working capital, mainly to purchase inventory during the months prior to
the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential
sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict
and respond to consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items and/or overproducing less popular items, would reduce our
total sales and harm our results of operations.
As
a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the
impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as a natural disaster, a terrorist attack,
economic shock or pandemic that harms the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events
such as strikes or port delays or other supply chain challenges that interfere with the shipment of goods, particularly from the Far
East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season.
Risks
Related to Taxes and Government Related Matters
We
face additional tax liabilities and collection obligations. Changes in, or differing interpretations of, income tax laws and rules, and
changes in our geographic operating results, may impact our effective tax rate.
We
are subject to income taxes in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as tax collection and reporting obligations in various
other jurisdictions where we conduct business. Changes in tax laws, regulations, or their interpretations, whether at the federal, state,
or international level, could increase our tax liabilities or compliance costs. For example, the OECD’s Pillar Two initiative has
resulted in the implementation of a 15% global minimum tax in the European Union and other jurisdictions, and additional countries are
actively considering similar legislation. At this time, we do not expect these developments to have a material impact on our effective
tax rate or financial position, but we continue to monitor legislative activity across relevant jurisdictions.
In
the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on certain stock repurchases.
These provisions currently do not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we are subject to routine
audits by domestic and international tax authorities. The outcome of tax audits or disputes, changes in applicable tax laws or rates,
or changes in the recognition of deferred tax assets could materially affect our effective tax rate, income tax expense, or cash flows.
32
We
are subject to various government regulations, violations of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition,
we could be the subject of future product liability suits or merchandise recalls, which could harm our business.
We
are subject to significant government regulations, including, in the U.S., under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous
Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international
markets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international
authorities. Advertising to children is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission,
and a host of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age of 13 is subject to the provisions
of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and other privacy laws around the world. The collection of personally identifiable
information from anyone, including adults, is under increasing regulation in many markets, such as the General Data Protection Regulation
adopted by the European Union, and data protection laws in the United States and in a number of other counties. While we take all the
steps, we believe are necessary to comply with these acts and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance and, if
we fail to comply with these requirements or other regulations enacted in the future, we could be subject to fines, liabilities or sanctions
which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject
to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally
not been material to our business, the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in aggregate in any given fiscal
year could be significant. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm the reputation of our
products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.
As
a multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust, employment,
customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmental regulations, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with
these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements
could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition.
Risks
Related to Litigation
We
may face increased costs in achieving our sustainability goals and any failure to achieve our goals could result in reputational damage.
We
view sustainability challenges as opportunities to innovate and continuously improve our product design and operational efficiencies.
We also believe the long-term viability and health of our own operations and our supply chain, and the significant potential for environmental
improvements, are critical to our business success. We have set key goals and objectives in this area as described in our business section
of this Form 10-K.
We
devote significant resources and expenditure to help achieve these goals. It is possible that we will incur significant expense in trying
to achieve these goals with no assurance that we will be successful. Additionally, our reputation could be damaged if we fail to achieve
our sustainability goals, or if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to the
production and packaging of our products.
Our
entertainment business involves risks of liability claims for media content, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.
As
a distributor of media content, we may face potential liability for defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark
infringement, and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed. These types of claims have been brought,
sometimes successfully, against producers and distributors of media content. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance
or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.
33
We
are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain, and which could entail significant expense.
As
a larger multinational corporation, we are subject to regulatory investigations, risks related to internal controls, litigation and arbitration
disputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may
be developed by us, claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties’ property or rights, or
claims by former employees for employment related matters. Because the outcome of litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations
is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and
harm our business. The fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face
legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful
claim against us could significantly harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
On June 6, 2024, Office Create Corporation filed a complaint against COKeM International Ltd. (“COKeM”) in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging contributory trademark infringement, contributory false designation of origin and unjust enrichment relating to COKeM’s [alleged] distribution of a specific video game, Cooking Mama: Cookstar. Office Create Corporation is seeking damages of no less than $20,913,200, plus interest of 9% accruing from October 3, 2022. On August 29, 2024, COKeM filed a response denying all allegations. COKeM intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. On September 12, 2024, COKeM filed a Third-Party Complaint against Planet Entertainment LLC and Steven Grossman asserting claims for indemnification and contribution. Mediation has been postponed. Office Create Corporation has filed an amended complaint impleading the former owner, chairman, CFO and SVP of Sales for COKeM seeking willful trademark infringement claims and civil conspiracy. Alliance filed an amended Answer insofar as any new claims pertain to COKeM directly on March 12, 2025. The Amended Complaint is now seeking damages in excess of $35MM. The court did schedule a settlement conference for August 11, 2025 but Office Create Corporation cancelled it with no new date scheduled. COKeM has offered a settlement amount of $330,000 which has been rejected by Office Create Corporation. COKeM believes that Office Create Corporation is relying on case law that has been overturned and precedent that is not-binding in the 8th Circuit. COKeM has some insurance coverage for this claim with CNA but the policy is capped at $2.5 million for all claims and also has to be shared with the VPPA class action claim(s) discussed below.
On August 8, 2024, a class action complaint, Feller v. Alliance Entertainment, LLC and DirectToU, LLC, was filed under the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”). The complaint alleges that the Company violated the VPPA by disclosing users’ personally identifiable information, as well as information regarding videos they viewed on the Company’s website, to Facebook through the use of Facebook Pixel. The Company is evaluating the claims and intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. At this time, the potential outcome or range of financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated.

Feller, Jeffry Haise, and Joseph Mull v. Alliance Entertainment, LLC and DirectToU, LLC, United States District Court for the
Southern District of Florida, Case No. 0:24-cv-61444; and Vivek Shah v. DirectToU, LLC, JAMS Arbitration, No. 5220006749.- On or
about September 12, 2024, Jonathan Hoang To, who allegedly used the website www.deepdiscount.com; Douglas Feller and Jeffry Haise,
who allegedly used the website www.ccvideo.com; Joseph Mull and Vivek Shah, who allegedly used the website www.moviesunlimited.com.
The lawsuits also put at issue any other website owned or operated by Alliance Entertainment, LLC (“Alliance”) or one of
its corporate affiliates, including the websites www.ccmusic.com and wowhd.co.uk. The lawsuits bring claims against DirectToU, LLC
(“DirectToU”) and/or Alliance, alleging a violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”) related to
the alleged collection of, and alleged disclosure to Meta and other third parties, including data brokers, of alleged private
information and user data regarding a user’s account information and video viewing/purchasing history from the respective
Websites. Plaintiff Hoang To also alleges violations of California’s state VPPA equivalent, as well as violations of
California’s Unfair Competition Law. DirectToU and Alliance dispute the allegations and will defend the lawsuits vigorously.
The parties in the Hoang To matter have reached a settlement with respect to all potential class members. The settlement agreement
has been submitted to the court for approval, slated for December 15, 2024. An approved settlement would cover the class members
covered by the Feller matter, rendering such litigation moot. A motion to stay the Feller matter pending court approval of the
settlement in Hoang To has been filed and granted. Counsel for the Feller parties filed a motion to intervene and stay the
settlement in Hoang, which motions were rejected. The parties await final settlement approval. The settlement was rejected and the
court has mandated the parties initiate discovery with respect to third-party data collection. The Alliance parties have filed a
reply memorandum in support of its motion to compel arbitration on April 28, 2025. The parties reached a settlement on June 12,
2025, whereby COKem will pay to the class a settlement amount of $1.577MM and COKeM’s insurance carrier CNA has approved to
cover their part of the settlement amount. COKeM will have an estimated receivable of $1.377M. The company had accrued for the
liability and the receivables from CNA on the balance sheet for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. The settlement approval before
the court is pending and is expected to be ruled on in late October/early November 2025.

McConigle v. Alliance/DirectToU, LLC: On December 29, 2024, McConigle filed a class action lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Case No. 0:24-cv-62443-DSL), alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227 (“TCPA”). On August 8, 2025, subsequent to year-end, the parties entered into a settlement agreement for $70,000. The Company did not record an accrual for this matter as of June 30, 2025, as the amount was not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect any further material impact from this matter.
Algomus v. Alliance: Alliance received a cease and desist notice from Algomus on July 24, 2025, alleging that Alliance
breached a non-solicitation provision of a Master Services Agreement between the parties when Alliance agreed to become the Category Advisor
for Walmart. Alliance responded to the letter on August 8, 2025, asserting that Algomus’s position lacks merit. Alliance had been
conducting business with Walmart prior to the Master Services Agreement, and Algomus and Walmart’s relationship is not governed
by the language of the non-solicitation provision.
On June 9, 2025,
Sparkle
Pop, LLC v. Alliance Entertainment Holding Corporation and Alliance Entertainment. LLC (U.S. Bankruptcy Court for MD-In Re Diamond Comic
Distributors): Sparkle Pop has sued the Alliance entities in bankruptcy court alleging theft of trade secrets and tortious interference
with contracts arising out of Alliance’s successful bid and subsequent termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement in the DCD bankruptcy
matter. Alliance brought a motion to dismiss the original complaint with prejudice, but during the pendency of the motion plaintiff filed
an Amended Complaint. Alliance will file a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint shortly.

Alliance
Has Fully Remediated Previously Identified Material Weaknesses in Its Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, we believe we fully remediated previously identified material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting. As a result, management has concluded, based on its assessment conducted in accordance with
Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that our internal controls were effective as of June 30, 2025.
However,
maintaining effective internal controls is an ongoing process subject to inherent limitations. Changes in personnel, evolving business
processes, new systems implementations, or other factors may impact the effectiveness of our controls. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. If we identify any new material weaknesses in the future, or if our remediation measures are not effective, any such
newly identified or existing material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures
that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain
compliance with securities law requirements regarding the timely filing of periodic reports, in addition to applicable stock exchange
listing requirements. Investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may decline as a result.
Prior
to the Business Combination, Adara had accounted for its outstanding Warrants as a warrant liability and following the Business Combination,
Alliance is now required to determine the value warrant liability for the Private Warrants quarterly, which could have a material impact
on Alliance’s financial position and operating results.
Included
on Alliance’s balance sheet as of June 30, 2025, and 2024, contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K, are derivative liabilities related
to embedded features contained within the Warrants. Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC
815”) provides for the remeasurement of the fair value of such derivatives at each balance sheet date, with a resulting non-cash
gain or loss related to the change in the fair value being recognized in earnings in the statements of income and comprehensive income. As a result of the
recurring fair value measurement, our financial statements and results of operations may fluctuate quarterly based on factors that are
outside of our control. Due to the recurring fair value measurement, we expect that we will recognize non-cash gains or losses on our
warrants each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or losses could be material.
Following
the Business Combination, although Alliance has determined that the Public Warrants are treated as equity, Alliance is required to continue
to recognize the changes in the fair value of the Private Warrants from the prior period, if any, in its operating results for the current
period, which could have a material impact on Alliance’s financial position and operating results.
35
Since
Alliance currently qualifies as an “emerging growth company” and a “smaller reporting company” within the meaning
of the Securities Act, it could make Alliance’s securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare
Alliance’s performance to the performance of other public companies.
Alliance
qualifies as an “emerging growth company” and a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 405 promulgated
under the Securities Act and Rule12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. As such, Alliance will be eligible for and intends to take
advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies, including (a) the exemption
from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, (b) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on- golden parachute voting requirements and (c) reduced disclosure
obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also
provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards
provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as Alliance is an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can
therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies, which
Alliance will not be able to do for its next fiscal year.
Even
after Alliance no longer qualifies as an emerging growth company, it may still qualify as a “smaller reporting company” or
“non-accelerated filer,” which would allow it to continue to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure
requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements. Moreover, smaller reporting
companies may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in their Annual Reports on Form
10-K.
Investors
may find the Class A common stock less attractive due to Alliance’s reliance on these exemptions, which could result in a less
active trading market for the stock and potentially greater price volatility.
Risks
Related to Our Securities
The
warrant agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of the Warrants, which
could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Alliance.
The
warrant agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating
in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New
York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction,
which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. Alliance will waive any objection to such exclusive
jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement do not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the
Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum.
Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of the Warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have
consented to the forum provisions in the warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum
provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (a “foreign action”) in the name of any holder of the Warrants, such holder shall be
deemed to have consented to:
(x)
the
personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any
such court to enforce the forum provisions (an “enforcement action”), and
(y)
having
service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder’s counsel
in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder.
36
This
choice of forum provision may limit a warrant holder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for
disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement
inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, Alliance may incur additional
costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.
Alliance
may redeem unexpired Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to a Warrant holder, thereby making the Warrants
worthless.
Alliance
has the ability to redeem outstanding Warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of
$0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted
for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading- day
period commencing once the warrants become exercisable and ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which Alliance gives
proper notice of such redemption and provided certain other conditions are met. If and when the Warrants become redeemable, Alliance
may not exercise our redemption right if the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the Warrants is not exempt from registration
or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or it is unable to affect such registration or qualification. Alliance will use
its best efforts to register or qualify such shares of Class A common stock under the blue-sky laws of the state of residence in those
states in which the Warrants were offered in the IPO, if necessary. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force holders (i) to
exercise the Warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for a holder to do so, (ii) to sell
Warrants at the then-current market price when the holder might otherwise wish to hold Warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption
price which, at the time the outstanding Warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value
of the Warrants. None of the Private Warrants are redeemable by Alliance so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees.
If
Warrant holders exercise Public Warrants on a “cashless basis,” they will receive fewer shares of Alliance common stock from
such exercise than if you were to exercise such warrants for cash.
There
are circumstances in which the exercise of the Public Warrants may be required or permitted to be made on a cashless basis. First, if
a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is not effective by a specified
date, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in
accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Second, if a registration statement covering the Class A
common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of the Business
Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when Alliance
shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise Warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided
by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available; if that exemption, or another exemption, is not
available, holders will not be able to exercise their Warrants on a cashless basis.
Third,
if Alliance calls the Public Warrants for redemption, Alliance’s management will have the option to require all holders that wish
to exercise Warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In the event of an exercise on a cashless basis, a holder would pay the Warrant exercise
price by surrendering the Warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price
of the Warrants and the “fair market value” (as defined in the next sentence) by (y) the fair market value. The “fair
market value” for this purpose shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class A common stock for the ten trading
days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the
notice of redemption is sent to the holders of Warrants, as applicable. As a result, you would receive fewer shares of Class A common
stock from such exercise than if you were to exercise such warrants for cash.
37
The
receipt of cash proceeds from the exercise of our Warrants is dependent upon the market price exceeding the $11.50 exercise price and
the Warrants being exercised for cash.
The
receipt of cash proceeds from our Warrants’ exercise depends on the market price exceeding the $11.50 exercise price and the Warrants
being exercised for cash. The $11.50 exercise price per share of the Warrants is considerably higher than the $6.00 closing sale price
of the Class A common stock on September 8, 2025. If the price of our Class A Common Stock remains below the respective Warrant exercise
prices per share, warrant holders will unlikely cash exercise their Warrants, resulting in little or no cash proceeds to us.
In
addition, we may lower the exercise price of the Warrants in accordance with the Warrant Agreement to induce the holders to exercise
such warrants. We may affect such a reduction in exercise price without the consent of such warrant holders and such reduction would
decrease the maximum amount of cash proceeds we would receive upon the exercise in full of the Warrants for cash. Further, the holders
of the Private Warrants and the Underwriter Warrants may exercise such Warrants on a cashless basis at any time. The holders of the Public
Warrants may exercise such Warrants on a cashless basis at any time a registration statement is not effective. A prospectus is not currently
available for issuing Class A common stock shares upon such exercise. Accordingly, we would not receive any proceeds from a cashless
exercise of Warrants.
Concentration
of ownership among Alliance’s executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant
corporate decisions.
As
of the date of this Form 10-K, the executive officers and directors and their affiliates collectively beneficially owned, directly, or
indirectly, excluding the Contingent Consideration Shares, approximately 99% of the outstanding Class A common stock.
As
a result, these stockholders are able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including
the election of directors, appointment and removal of officers, any amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation and approval of mergers
and other business combination transactions requiring stockholder approval, including proposed transactions that would result in Alliance’s
stockholders receiving a premium price for their shares and other significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect
of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible
without the support of these stockholders.
An
active trading market may not develop for our securities, and you may not be able to sell your Class A common stock at or above the price
per share for which you purchased it.
Our
Class A common stock shares are thinly traded, and we cannot predict when or if an active trading market will develop or how liquid that
market might become. If such a market does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of Class
A common stock at a time or at price that is attractive to you, or at all.
The
trading market for our Class A common stock in the future could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors, including,
but not limited to:
●
Actual
or anticipated variations in our results of operations.
38
●
Our
ability or inability to generate revenues or profit.
●
The
relatively small number of shares in our public float, which could exacerbate stock price volatility.
●
Increased
competition.
Furthermore,
our stock price may be impacted by unrelated or disproportionate factors to our operating performance. These market fluctuations, along
with general economic, political, and market conditions—such as recessions, interest rates, or international currency fluctuations—may
adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Due to our status as a smaller reporting company, the limited number of
shares in our public float could contribute to extreme fluctuations in our Class A common stock price, increasing the risk of price volatility.
We
might not be able to maintain the listing of our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
Our
Class A common stock and warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
maintain the listing standards of that exchange, which include requirements that we maintain our stockholders’ equity, total value
of shares held by unaffiliated stockholders, and market capitalization above certain specified levels. If we fail to maintain the Nasdaq
listing requirements on an ongoing basis, our Class A common stock might cease to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and may move to
the OTCQX, OTCQB or OTC Pink Open Market operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. These quotation services are generally considered to be
less efficient, and to provide less liquidity, than the Nasdaq Capital Market.
If
securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about Alliance, its business, or its market, or
if they change their recommendations regarding Alliance’s securities adversely, the price and trading volume of Alliance’s
securities could decline.
The
trading market for Alliance’s securities is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish
about Alliance, its business, market, or competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research
on Alliance. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of Alliance, Alliance’s share price and trading volume would
likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover Alliance change their recommendation regarding Alliance’s shares
of common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about its competitors, the price of Alliance’s shares
of common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover Alliance were to cease coverage of Alliance or fail to regularly publish
reports on it, Alliance could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause its share price or trading volume to
decline.
Because
we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on Alliance’s common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return
on investment unless you sell Alliance’s common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.
Alliance
may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and has no current plans to pay any cash dividends
for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends as a public company in the future will be made at the discretion
of Alliance’s board of directors and will depend on, among other things, Alliance’s results of operations, financial condition,
cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that Alliance’s board of directors may deem relevant. In addition,
Alliance’s ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness it or its subsidiaries
incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in the Class A common stock unless you sell your shares of common
stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.
Anti-takeover
provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of Alliance, which may be beneficial
to its stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by its stockholders to replace or remove Alliance’s then current management.
The
Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions that may delay or prevent an acquisition of Alliance or a change in its management.
These provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove members of the board of directors. Because the board
of directors is responsible for appointing the members of the management team, these provisions could in turn frustrate or prevent any
attempt by the stockholders to replace or remove current management. In addition, these provisions could limit the price that investors
might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Class A common stock. Among other things, these provisions include:
●
the
limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, its directors and officers.
39
●
a
prohibition on actions by its stockholders except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders.
●
a
prohibition on actions by its stockholders by written consent; and
●
the
ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a “poison
pill” that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that
have not been approved by the board of directors.
Moreover,
because Alliance is incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the DGCL), which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with Alliance for
a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired 15% or more of Alliance’s outstanding voting
stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This could discourage, delay, or prevent a third party from
acquiring or merging with Alliance, whether or not it is desired by, or beneficial to, its stockholders. This could also have the effect
of discouraging others from making tender offers for Alliance’s common stock, including transactions that may be in its stockholders’
best interests. Finally, these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors
or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. These provisions would apply even if the offer may be considered
beneficial by some stockholders. For more information, see the section titled “Description of Securities — Certain Anti-Takeover
Provisions of Delaware Law and the Existing Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.”
The
Certificate of Incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against
our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty and certain other actions may be brought only in
the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will, subject to
certain exceptions, be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder’s counsel, which may have the effect
of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders.
The
Certificate of Incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in the name of Alliance,
actions against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any officer, director
or other employee of Alliance or Alliance’s shareholders, any action asserting a claim against Alliance, its directors, officers
or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws and certain other actions
may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the
suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder’s counsel except any action (A) as to which the
Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following
such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery or (C) for
which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest
in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation.
This choice of forum provision may limit or make more costly a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that
it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees, or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits
with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Certificate of incorporation
to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions,
which could harm Alliance’s business, operating results and financial condition.
40
The
Certificate of Incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, subject to certain exceptions. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce
any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision
will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal
courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, The Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless Alliance consents in writing
to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. There is, however, the uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce this provision and
that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities
Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the
Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.
A
possible “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand of our Class A common stock that largely exceeds supply may lead
to price volatility in our Class A common stock.
Investors
may purchase our Class A common stock to hedge existing exposure in our Class A common stock or to speculate on the price of our Class
A common stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short
exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A common stock available for purchase in the open market, investors with short exposure
may have to pay a premium to repurchase our common stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A common stock. Those repurchases may in
turn, dramatically increase the price of our Class A common stock until investors with short exposure are able to purchase additional
Class A common stock to cover their short position. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.” A short squeeze could
lead to volatile price movements in our common stock that are not directly correlated to the performance or prospects of our Class A
common stock and once investors purchase the shares of Class A common stock necessary to cover their short position the price of our
Class A common stock may decline.
We
may issue additional shares of Class A common stock or preferred shares under the 2023 Plan, which would dilute the interest of our stockholders.
Pursuant
to the Certificate of Incorporation, Alliance’s authorized capital stock consists of 490,000,000 shares of Class A common stock,
60,000,000 shares of Alliance Class E common stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of the date of this 10-K, we have 50,957,370
shares of Class A common Stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. We may issue a substantial number of additional
shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock under the 2023 Plan. Pursuant to Alliance’s 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan,
Alliance may issue an aggregate of up to 1,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, which amount may be subject to increase from time
to time. For additional information about this plan, please read the discussion under the heading “Alliance’s Executive
Compensation — Employee Benefit Plans.” Additionally, as of the date of this 10-K, Alliance has Warrants outstanding
to purchase an aggregate of 9,920,090 shares of common stock. Alliance may also issue additional shares of common stock or other equity
securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions, or repayment of outstanding
indebtedness, without stockholder approval, in a number of circumstances.

may
significantly dilute the equity interest of holders of Class A common stock.
●
may
subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if one or more classes of preferred stock are created, and such shares
of preferred stock are issued, with rights senior to those afforded to Class A common stock.
●
could
cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our
ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers
and directors; and

1C. Cybersecurity
In
the ordinary course of business, we receive, process, use, and store digitally large amounts of data, including customer data as well
as confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and personal information. Maintaining the integrity and availability of our information technology
systems and this information, as well as appropriate limitations on access and confidentiality of such information, is important to us
and our business operations. To this end, we have implemented a program designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from potential
unauthorized occurrences on or through our information technology systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of these systems and the data residing in them.
The
program is managed by our executive management team, and includes mechanisms, controls, technologies, systems, policies, and other processes
designed to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting the systems and data
residing in them. We consult with and rely upon outside advisors and experts to assist us with assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity
risks.
We
consider cybersecurity, along with other significant risks that we face, within our overall enterprise risk management framework. Our
Board of Directors has oversight for the most significant risks facing us and for our processes to identify, prioritize, assess, manage,
and mitigate those risks. The Board of Directors receives periodic updates on cybersecurity and information technology matters and related
risk exposures from management.

3. Legal Proceedings.
Alliance
is currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary
course of business. These include proceedings, claims, and investigations relating to, among other things, regulatory matters, commercial
matters, intellectual property, competition, tax, employment, pricing, discrimination, consumer rights, personal injury, and property
rights.

Depending
on the nature of the proceeding, claim, or investigation, the Company may be subject to monetary damage awards, fines, penalties, or
injunctive orders. Furthermore, the outcome of these matters could materially adversely affect Alliance’s business, results of
operations, and financial condition. The outcomes of legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations are inherently unpredictable
and subject to significant judgment to determine the likelihood and amount of loss related to such matters.
On June 6, 2024, Office Create Corporation filed a complaint against COKeM International Ltd. (“COKeM”) in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging contributory trademark infringement, contributory false designation of origin and unjust enrichment relating to COKeM’s [alleged] distribution of a specific video game, Cooking Mama: Cookstar. Office Create Corporation is seeking damages of no less than $20,913,200, plus interest of 9% accruing from October 3, 2022. On August 29, 2024, COKeM filed a response denying all allegations. COKeM intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. On September 12, 2024, COKeM filed a Third-Party Complaint against Planet Entertainment LLC and Steven Grossman asserting claims for indemnification and contribution. Mediation has been postponed. Office Create Corporation has filed an amended complaint impleading the former owner, chairman, CFO and SVP of Sales for COKeM seeking willful trademark infringement claims and civil conspiracy. Alliance filed an amended Answer insofar as any new claims pertain to COKeM directly on March 12, 2025. The Amended Complaint is now seeking damages in excess of $35MM. The court did schedule a settlement conference for August 11, 2025 but Office Create Corporation cancelled it with no new date scheduled. COKeM has offered a settlement amount of $330,000 which has been rejected by Office Create Corporation. COKeM believes that Office Create Corporation is relying on case law that has been overturned and precedent that is not-binding in the 8th Circuit. COKeM has some insurance coverage for this claim with CNA but the policy is capped at $2.5 million for all claims and also has to be shared with the VPPA class action claim(s) discussed below.
On
August 8, 2024, a class action complaint, Feller v. Alliance Entertainment, LLC and DirectToU, LLC, was filed under the Video
Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”). The complaint alleges that the Company violated the VPPA by disclosing users’ personally
identifiable information, as well as information regarding videos they viewed on the Company’s website, to Facebook through the
use of Facebook Pixel. The Company is evaluating the claims and intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. At this time, the
potential outcome or range of financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated.

Feller, Jeffry Haise, and Joseph Mull v. Alliance Entertainment, LLC and DirectToU, LLC, United States District Court for the
Southern District of Florida, Case No. 0:24-cv-61444; and Vivek Shah v. DirectToU, LLC, JAMS Arbitration, No. 5220006749.- On or
about September 12, 2024, Jonathan Hoang To, who allegedly used the website www.deepdiscount.com; Douglas Feller and Jeffry Haise,
who allegedly used the website www.ccvideo.com; Joseph Mull and Vivek Shah, who allegedly used the website www.moviesunlimited.com.
The lawsuits also put at issue any other website owned or operated by Alliance Entertainment, LLC (“Alliance”) or one of
its corporate affiliates, including the websites www.ccmusic.com and wowhd.co.uk. The lawsuits bring claims against DirectToU, LLC
(“DirectToU”) and/or Alliance, alleging a violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”) related to
the alleged collection of, and alleged disclosure to Meta and other third parties, including data brokers, of alleged private
information and user data regarding a user’s account information and video viewing/purchasing history from the respective
Websites. Plaintiff Hoang To also alleges violations of California’s state VPPA equivalent, as well as violations of
California’s Unfair Competition Law. DirectToU and Alliance dispute the allegations and will defend the lawsuits vigorously.
The parties in the Hoang To matter have reached a settlement with respect to all potential class members. The settlement agreement
has been submitted to the court for approval, slated for December 15, 2024. An approved settlement would cover the class members
covered by the Feller matter, rendering such litigation moot. A motion to stay the Feller matter pending court approval of the
settlement in Hoang To has been filed and granted. Counsel for the Feller parties filed a motion to intervene and stay the
settlement in Hoang, which motions were rejected. The parties await final settlement approval. The settlement was rejected and the
court has mandated the parties initiate discovery with respect to third-party data collection. The Alliance parties have filed a
reply memorandum in support of its motion to compel arbitration on April 28, 2025. The parties reached a settlement on June 12,
2025, whereby COKeM will pay to the class a settlement amount of $1.577MM and COKeM’s insurance carrier CNA has approved to
cover their part of the settlement amount. COKeM will have an estimated receivable of $1.377M. The company has accrued the liability
in current liabilities and the receivables in current assets on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2025. The settlement approval
before the court is pending and is expected to be ruled on in late October/early November 2025.
Balabbo
v Abysse America, Inc., Target Corporation, DirectToU, LLC (Prop 65): On or about December 11, 2024, DirectToU received a tender of defense
from Target Corporation citing a possible violation of California Proposition 65 for a product sold by DirectToU allegedly containing
lead. The product in question was supplied to Alliance by Abysse America. Alliance/DTU have tendered defense to Abysse. Abysse has engaged
counsel to respond to the Prop 65 Violation Notice. At this time, Alliance/DTU have discontinued the product, but have documentation
supplied by Abysse showing that the product was properly tested and was within allowable thresholds for lead and other substances.
Algomus
v. Alliance: Alliance received a cease and desist notice from Algomus on July 24, 2025, alleging that Alliance breached a non-solicitation
provision of a Master Services Agreement between the parties when Alliance agreed to become the Category Advisor for Walmart. Alliance
responded to the letter on August 8, 2025, asserting that Algomus’s position lacks merit. Alliance had been conducting business
with Walmart prior to the Master Services Agreement, and Algomus and Walmart’s relationship is not governed by the language of the
non-solicitation provision.
On June 9, 2025,

Pop, LLC v. Alliance Entertainment Holding Corporation and Alliance Entertainment. LLC (U.S. Bankruptcy Court for MD-In Re Diamond Comic

matter. Alliance brought a motion to dismiss the original complaint with prejudice, but during the pendency of the motion plaintiff filed
an Amended Complaint. Alliance will file a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint shortly.
McConigle v. Alliance/DirectToU, LLC: On December 29, 2024, McConigle filed a class action lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Case No. 0:24-cv-62443-DSL), alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227 (“TCPA”). On August 8, 2025, subsequent to year-end, the parties entered into a settlement agreement for $70,000. The Company did not record an accrual for this matter as of June 30, 2025, as the amount was not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect any further material impact from this matter.

Employing
an established multi-channel strategy, Alliance distributes physical media, entertainment products, hardware, and accessories across
various platforms. Currently, the company sells its products, permitted for export, to more than 70 countries worldwide.
Alliance
provides state-of-the art warehousing and distribution technologies, operating systems and services that seamlessly enable entertainment
product transactions to better serve customers directly or through our distribution affiliates. These technology-led platforms with access
to the Company’s in stock inventory of over 340,000 SKU products, consisting of vinyl records, video games, compact discs, DVD,
Blu-Rays, toys, electronics and collectables, combined with Alliance’s sales and distribution network, create a modern entertainment
physical product marketplace that provides the discerning customer with enhanced options on efficient consumer-friendly platforms inventory.
Alliance is the retailers’ back office for in-store and e-commerce solutions. All electronic data interchange (“EDI”)
and logistics are operational and ready for existing retail channels to add new products.
License
Agreements
In
January 2025, Alliance entered into an exclusive home entertainment distribution agreement with Paramount Pictures, designating Alliance
as the sole distributor of Paramount’s physical media – including DVDs, Blu-rays, and 4K UHD titles, across the United States
and Canada. This strategic partnership significantly enhances Alliance’s leadership in home entertainment distribution by providing
direct access to Paramount’s extensive library of blockbuster films and iconic TV series. The collaboration has already yielded
positive results. This partnership not only strengthens relationships with major retailers and collectors but also reinforces Alliance’s
commitment to delivering high-quality entertainment products to consumers.
Merger
and Business Acquisition
Alliance
has a proven history of successfully acquiring and integrating competitors and complementary businesses. The Company will continue to
evaluate opportunities to identify targets that meet strategic and economic criteria.
On
December 17, 2024, we acquired Handmade by Robots from Bensussen Deutsch & Associates, LLC for $7.6 million. Handmade by Robots produces
licensed vinyl figures that mimic the look of knitted or crocheted plush toys and feature characters from popular franchises such as
DC Comics, Ghostbusters, Harry Potter, Star Trek, and Stranger Things. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase, with the
purchase price allocated to inventory, tooling equipment, and a trademark associated with the product line.
The
Handmade by Robots acquisition enhances our portfolio by adding an exclusive collectible line that expands our reach into licensed pop
culture merchandise. While the financial contribution of Handmade by Robots since the acquisition date has not been material to our consolidated
results for fiscal 2025, we expect this product line to provide incremental revenue growth opportunities in future periods.
On
February 10, 2023, Alliance completed its business combination with Adara Acquisition Corp., which was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization
with Alliance treated as the accounting acquirer. As a result of this transaction, the Company continues to recognize non-cash fair value
remeasurement adjustments related to its outstanding warrants. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Company recorded a non-cash
loss of $0.9 million related to changes in the fair value of its warrants, compared to a loss of $0.04 million for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2024. These adjustments may create volatility in reported results; however, they do not impact cash flows from operations.
45
Macroeconomic
Uncertainties
Macroeconomic conditions, including persistent inflation, continued to influence our operating environment in fiscal
2025. Warehouse costs declined year-over-year, reflecting improved operating efficiencies, and interest expense under our credit facility
decreased due to lower borrowings. At the same time, renewed tariff discussions on imported physical media and electronics present potential
cost increases that could pressure future gross margins. While we did not experience material supply chain disruptions in fiscal 2025,
we continue to monitor these factors and their potential impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For further
discussion of related risks, see Part I, Item 1A. ‘Risk Factors.
Key
Performance Indicators
Management
monitors and analyzes key performance indicators to evaluate financial performance, including:
Net
Revenue: To derive Net Revenue, the Company reduces total gross sales by customer returns, returns reserve, and allowances including
discounts.
Cost
of Revenues (excluding depreciation and amortization): Our cost of revenues reflects the total costs incurred to market and distribute
products to customers. Changes in cost are impacted primarily by sales volume, product mix, product obsolescence, freight costs, and
market development funds (“MDF”).
Margins:
To analyze profitability, the Company reviews gross and net margins in dollars and as a percentage of revenue by line of business
and product line.
Operating
Expenses: Our Operating Expenses are the direct and indirect costs associated with the distribution and fulfillment of products and
services. They include both Distribution and Fulfillment and Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses. The Distribution
and Fulfillment Expenses are the payroll and operating expenses associated with the receipt, warehousing, and distribution of product.
Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses: The Selling, General and Administrative Expenses are payroll and operating costs for Information
Technology, Sales & Marketing, and General & Administrative functions. In addition, we include Depreciation and Amortization
expenses and Transaction Costs, if applicable.
Balance
Sheet Indicators: The Company views cash, product inventory, accounts payable, and working capital as key indicators of its financial
position.

Net
Revenue: Year-over-year, total net revenues slightly decreased from $1,100 million to $1,063 million (-$37 million, -3%) for the
year ended June 30, 2025. Like other U.S. retailers and distributors, we continue to face macroeconomic headwinds stemming from high
interest rates, cautious consumer spending due to reduced purchasing power, and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties. Despite these challenges,
Alliance Entertainment distinguishes itself as a value-added retail distributor with exclusive distribution rights for approximately
175 film and music studios and labels. Our robust portfolio of exclusive content, coupled with deep inventory levels, positions us to
effectively serve both bulk B2B customers and the direct-to-consumer (DTC) market with a broad selection of products not readily available
through other distributors. Our proprietary DTC distribution and inventory solutions—anchored by our consumer-direct subsidiary,
DirectToU LLC which contributed approximately 37% of gross revenue for the year ended June 30, 2025, up from 36% in the prior
year.
Year
over year, vinyl record sales increased from $329 million to $340 million ($11 million, 3%) for the year ending June 30, 2025. This growth was driven by a 3.8% increase in sales volume, partly offset
by a 0.5% reduction in the average selling price. The modest decline in pricing was outweighed by higher unit demand, resulting in overall
revenue growth.
Robust early demand and pre-sales ahead of Record Store Day in April 2025 also supported performance. We expect continued momentum from
collectors and music enthusiasts drawn to the physical format and limited-edition releases. Notable vinyl releases during the twelve
months ended June 30, 2025, included Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department (including its Anniversary
Anthology vinyl edition), Sabrina Carpenter’s deluxe Short n’ Sweet, Billy Idol’s Dream Into It (his
first new album in over a decade), Lorde’s critically acclaimed Virgin, and Bruce Springsteen’s archival box set Tracks
II: The Lost Albums. Our leading vinyl distribution partners for the period included Walmart, Barnes & Noble, and Amazon.
Music
Compact Discs (CDs) sales slightly decreased from $130 million to $125 million (-$5 million, -4%) for the year ended June 30, 2025. The
decline was primarily the result of a 4.5% reduction in average selling price, which more than offset a modest 0.4% increase in unit
volume. While consumer demand showed slight improvement, pricing pressure weighed on overall revenue performance. A key driver of the
decline in average selling price for CD sales was increased pricing pressure and a shift in consumer purchases toward lower-priced formats.
Throughout the year, interest in expanded anniversary re-issues, collector’s editions, and multi-disc box sets remained steady.
However, these premium formats represented a smaller share of total sales compared to prior years, as more consumers gravitated toward
standard, lower-priced releases. This shift in product mix contributed to the overall decline in average selling price.
47
Physical
movie sales, which include DVDs, Blu-Ray, and Ultra HD, increased from $204 million to $279 million (+$75 million, +37%) for the year
ended June 30, 2025, versus the same period last year. Unit volume rose by 14.8% year over year, and an 18.8% increase in
average selling price further amplified growth, resulting in strong overall revenue performance. The strong growth in physical movie sales was driven by
a steady pipeline of theatrical releases and continued consumer interest in premium formats such as 4K Ultra HD and collectible SteelBooks.
The launch of a new exclusive content partnership in January 2025 further strengthened our film portfolio, introducing a slate of high-profile
titles that enhanced both our pricing power and retail visibility. This shift toward premium content significantly contributed to the
increase in average selling price, even as overall volume declined. We expect this trend to continue, as brick-and-mortar retailers increasingly
prioritize curated, high-value offerings to meet demand for omnichannel shopping experiences over lower-cost, mass-market inventory.
With a robust content pipeline and strengthened retail partnerships, we are well-positioned to capitalize on evolving consumer preferences
and deliver sustained growth across our physical media business.
Year-over-year,
gaming sales decreased from $338 million to $255 million (-$83 million, -25%) for the 12 months ended June 30, 2025. Unit volume declined by 61.5%, reflecting limited hardware availability
and delays in major game releases from key publishers. However, this was partially offset by a 93.4% increase in average selling price,
driven by a stronger product mix that included more premium accessories, collector-focused items, and reduced discounting. The June 2025
release of the Nintendo Switch 2 also contributed to elevated price points but did not fully offset the steep drop in units sold. As a leading distributor of physical gaming products,
we are well-positioned to benefit from the upcoming wave of next-generation console releases and growing demand for high-end gaming accessories.
We continue to adapt our inventory and purchasing strategies to align with evolving industry trends and are prepared to support both
retailers and consumers as the market rebounds.
For
the year ended June 30, 2025, consumer products revenue, which includes Collectibles and Electronics, decreased from $43 million
to $37 million (-$6 million, -14%) versus the prior year. Collectibles revenue totaled $22 million, down from $26 million
the prior year (-$4 million, -15%). Unit volume increased 19.5%, but this growth was outweighed by a 30%
decline in average selling price, resulting in lower overall revenue. Following our acquisition of Handmade by Robots, we anticipate a strong lineup of new theatrical and streaming releases that will
drive collectible and merchandise sales, boosting margins. The collectibles market remains an integral part of the entertainment category,
driven by its mix of nostalgic, investment, and intrinsic value. We continue to view this category as an important and profitable part
of the entertainment ecosystem. Electronics revenue was $15 million, down slightly from $16 million in the prior year (-$1 million, -6%).
This decline was driven by a 5.3% decrease in unit volume combined
with a 4.1% decrease in average selling price. The softer pricing reflects ongoing competitive pressures and product mix shifts, while
the modest volume decline indicates more stable demand compared to the prior year.
Cost
of Revenues: Total cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased from $972 million to $931 million ($41 million
or 4%) year over year primarily due to the direct relation of product costs to sales volume. gross margin dollars increased $4 million
year over year on lower sales and higher gross margins. Gross margins increased from 11.7% to 12.5% (+.8 percentage points) for the year ended June 30, 2025, versus June 30, 2024. The improvement in the gross margin was primarily driven by higher average selling
prices and the successful launch of a new exclusive content partnership. Additionally, enhanced inventory management and increased vendor
rebate activity contributed to stronger profitability and overall margin expansion.
Operating
Expenses: Total Operating Expenses declined 10.3% and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 10.4% to 9.7% (.7 percentage points)
year over year. Distribution and Fulfillment expenses declined in terms of absolute dollars and the percentage of revenue, and Selling
General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses declined in terms of absolute dollars as well.
Total
Distribution and Fulfillment Expense, as a percentage of net revenue, decreased from 4.4% to 3.8% (.6 percentage point) for the year
ended June 30, 2025, versus the prior year. This improvement was driven by reductions in both fulfillment and payroll expenses,
as we implemented a strategic plan to streamline operations without compromising service levels. In May 2024, we closed our Shakopee,
MN warehouse and consolidated fulfillment operations in Shepherdsville, KY, enhancing efficiency, eliminating redundancies, and lowering
operating costs for the twelve-month period. We also continue to invest in warehouse automation to reduce reliance on permanent labor,
while leveraging temporary labor to manage fluctuations in demand. As a result, total fulfillment payroll expenses declined by $5 million,
or 17%, for the year ended June 30, 2025. Despite historically low unemployment rates, the average cost per labor hour fell by 4.6% year
over year. Additionally, non-payroll fulfillment costs, including storage, declined significantly, reflecting continued efforts to optimize
warehouse operations and improve cost structure.
48
A
key contributor to the decline in operating expenses was a $1.7 million, or 2.9%, reduction in Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A)
expenses for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to the prior year. SG&A costs decreased from $57.7 million to $56 million,
while remaining relatively steady as a percentage of net revenue at 5.3%, compared to 5.2% in the prior year. In addition to lower overhead,
Transaction Costs fell from $2.1 million to $1.0 million. We continually review SG&A expenses, including business processes, to identify
opportunities for further cost reductions and operational efficiency.
Interest
Expense: Interest expense decreased from $12.2 million to $10.6 million ($1.6 million or 13.1%) for the year ended June 30, 2025,
versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by both a lower average effective interest rate, which declined from 9.5% to 9.2%, and
a reduction in the average revolver balance, which fell by $25.5 million (25%) from $103 million to $77.5 million for the year ended
June 30, 2025.
Income
Tax: For the year ended June 30, 2025, an income tax provision of $3.6 million was recorded compared to tax benefit of $2.7 million
for the prior year. Alliance reported a pretax income of $18.7 million and
$1.9 million for the years
ended June 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively. The annual effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2025, was
19% due to an immaterial true up adjustment to deferred income taxes related to the net tax effects of temporary differences between
the amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures: For the year ended June 30, 2025, we had non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $36.5 million compared with Adjusted EBITDA
of $24.3 million prior year or an improvement of $12.2 million year-over-year. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted
to exclude: (i) income tax expense; (ii) other income (loss); (iii) interest expense; and (iv) depreciation and amortization expense
and (v) other infrequent, non- recurring expenses. Our method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may differ from other issuers and accordingly,
this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our own operating performance
and as an integral part of our planning process. We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure because we believe such a measure
is useful to investors as a reasonable indicator of operating performance. We believe this measure is a financial metric used by many
investors to compare companies. This measure is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP in the United States and
should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings (losses), net earnings (loss) from continuing operations or cash flows
from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. See the table below for a reconciliation, for the periods presented,
of our GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity:
On December 21, 2023, Alliance Entertainment Holding Corporation entered into a Revolving Credit Facility, which is a three-year
$120 million senior secured asset-based credit facility with White Oak Commercial Finance, LLC. The Revolving Credit Facility replaced
the Company’s revolver with Bank of America (the “Prior Credit Facility”). The Prior Credit Facility was scheduled
to expire on December 31, 2023.
The
Company has implemented certain strategic initiatives to reduce expenses and focus on the sale of higher margin products. As a result
of the new credit facility, combined with these initiatives and the Company’s financial performance for the year ended June 30,
2025, the Company has concluded that it has sufficient cash to fund its operations and obligations (from its cash on hand, operations,
working capital and availability on the credit facility) for at least twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated financial
statements.
Our
primary sources of liquidity are existing cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our
credit facility. As of June 30, 2025, in addition to the $1.2 million of cash, we carried a $57 million revolver balance on our $120
million credit facility under the Loan and Security Agreement with White Oak Commercial Finance, LLC. Since June 30, 2024, our availability
increased from $44 million to $54 million, an increase of $10 million, as we converted accounts receivable and inventory to cash which
was used to reduce the revolver from $73 million to $57 million ($16 million or 22%) year over year.

The
Company currently intends to continue relying primarily on its borrowing capacity under the Current Credit Facility, as well as any
renewal or replacement of such facility, to fund working capital and other operational requirements. The availability of additional
cash proceeds from the potential exercise of outstanding Warrants is contingent upon the market price of the Company’s Class A
common stock exceeding the Warrant exercise price of $11.50 per share. Given that the market price of the Class A common stock was
$3.77 as of June 30, 2025, the Company does not currently expect Warrants to be exercised unless and until the market price exceeds
the exercise price. Although the Company does not currently have any definitive plans to do so, it may seek to raise additional
capital through the issuance of equity securities in the future, depending on market conditions, strategic opportunities and
liquidity needs.
In
addition, we may lower the exercise price of the Warrants in accordance with the Warrant Agreement to induce the holders to exercise
such Warrants. We may effect such reduction in exercise price without the consent of such warrant holders and such reduction would decrease
the maximum amount of cash proceeds we would receive upon the exercise in full of the Warrants for cash. Further, the holders of the
Private Warrants and the Underwriter Warrants may exercise such Warrants on a cashless basis at any time and the holders of the Public
Warrants may exercise such Warrants on a cashless basis at any time an effective registration statement is not available for the issuance
of shares of Class A common stock upon such exercise. Accordingly, we would not receive any proceeds from a cashless exercise of Warrants.
Cash
Flow: The following table summarizes our net cash provided by or used on operating activities, investing activities and financing
activities for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the year ended
June 30, 2025 and 2024.

For
the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company generated $26.8 million in cash from operating activities on net income of $15.1 million, compared
to $55.8 million in the prior year. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by a $10 million increase in net income and a $22
million increase in accounts payable, compared to an $18 million decrease in accounts payable in the prior year, reflecting the impact
of improved cash management practices. Inventory increased by $5 million as of June 30, 2025, whereas in the prior year it had decreased
by $49 million. The significant reduction in the prior year reflected efforts to draw down surplus inventory that had accumulated during
the pandemic due to supply chain disruptions. That inventory had supported sales throughout fiscal 2024, contributing to the large swing.
Additionally, working capital declined modestly by $3 million year over year—from $48 million to $45 million. Changes in the inventory
and sales mix during fiscal 2025 led to higher payable balances to vendors offering extended payment terms.
Cash
Flows used in investing activities for the 12 months ended June 30, 2025 were at $8 million. By comparison, for the 12 months ended June
30, 2024, cashflow used in investing activities was $0.1 million. In fiscal year 2025, Alliance Entertainment reported a significant increase
in cash used for business acquisitions, totaling approximately $7.6 million. This outflow was related to a planned acquisition that ultimately
did not materialize. Although the transaction was not completed, the funds had already been disbursed as part of the acquisition process.
The company is currently in the process of recovering these funds, and the reimbursement is expected to be reflected in future reporting
periods. This one-time event temporarily inflated investing cash outflows and does not reflect ongoing acquisition activity.
For
the year ended June 30, 2025, net cash used in financing activities totaled $19 million, compared to $55 million in the prior year. The
current year’s financing activity primarily reflects net repayments on the revolving credit facility of $15.7 million, resulting
from $986.1 million in payments and $970.4 million in borrowings. In contrast, the prior year saw heavier net repayments of $60.3 million.
Additionally, there were no proceeds from shareholder loans in fiscal 2025, while the prior year included $46 million in inflows and
$36 million in repayments. Other financing activities in the current year include $2.8 million in payments on financing leases, consistent
with the prior year, which saw $3.0 million. Overall, the lower cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2025 reflects more moderate
debt activity and the absence of shareholder-related financing transactions.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
The
consolidated financial statements and disclosures have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
which require that management apply accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions that impact the results of operations and the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. Management uses estimates and judgments based on historical experience
and other variables believed to be reasonable at the time. Actual results may differ from these estimates under a separate set of assumptions
or conditions. Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies
and methods used by the Company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates inherent in
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include management’s estimates related to the sales returns reserve, customer
rebates and discount reserves, inventory valuation, goodwill and intangible asset impairment, and the fair value of warrants. On an ongoing
basis, management evaluates its estimates compared to historical experience and trends, which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying value of assets and liabilities.
Management believes that of the Company’s
significant accounting policies and estimates, the following involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity:
Inventory
and Returns Reserve: Product inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The valuation of inventory requires
significant judgment and estimates, including evaluating the need for any adjustments to net realizable value related to excess or obsolete
inventory to ensure that the inventory is reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value. For all product categories, the Company
records any adjustments to net realizable value, if appropriate, based on historical sales, current inventory levels, anticipated customer
demand, and general market conditions.
51
For
the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company continued to perform a net realizable value analysis to determine if a reserve or write-down
was necessary for excess or obsolete inventory. The key assumptions in this analysis included estimated monthly sales and the average
sales price of inventory items. The analysis considered factors such as fluctuations in market prices, recent purchase invoices, and
advertised prices, adjusted for potential discounts and costs to complete and sell.
The
Company tests its goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the entity may be less than its
carrying amount. For the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the entity level, which
is considered a single reporting unit. Based on this analysis, the Company determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded
its carrying value, and no impairment was recognized.
Intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization, if applicable. Definite-lived intangible assets
are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 5 to 15 years. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including certain
trade names, are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is also tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if triggering
events occur. There was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets for the year ended June 30, 2025.
Given
the inherent uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, including interest rates and economic conditions, actual results could differ
from management’s estimates, which could lead to future impairment charges.
Business
Combinations — Valuation of Acquired Assets and Liabilities Assumed: The Company allocates the purchase price for each business
combination, or acquired business, based upon (i) the fair value of the consideration paid and (ii) the fair value of net assets acquired,
and liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires estimates and judgements
of future cash flow expectations for the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable tangible and intangible
assets. Fair values are calculated by applying estimates related to Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Weighted Average Cost of Capital
(WACC) assumptions as well as incorporating expected cash flows into industry standard valuation techniques. Goodwill is the amount by
which the purchase price consideration exceeds the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired, less assumed liabilities. Intangible
assets, such as customer relations and trade names, when identified, are separately recognized and amortized over their estimated useful
lives, if considered definite lived. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and are included in the consolidated statements of income
and comprehensive income.
Warrant
Liability – The Company’s warrant liability is remeasured at fair value as of the reporting period balance sheet date. The
fair value of the Private Warrant was measured using the Black Scholes model approach. Significant inputs into the respective models
at June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2024, are as follows:

The

The
significant assumptions using the Black Scholes model approach for valuation of the Private Placement Warrants and Representative Warrants
were determined in the following manner:
●
Risk-free
interest rate: the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate with a term matching the time to expiration.
●
Expected
term: the expected term is estimated to be equivalent to the remaining contractual term.
●
Expected
volatility: expected stock volatility is based on daily observations of the Company’s historical stock value and implied by
market price of the Public Warrants, adjusted by guideline public company volatility.
●
Expected
dividend yield: expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s anticipated dividend payments. As the Company has never issued
dividends, the expected dividend yield is 0% and this assumption will be continued in future calculations unless the Company changes
its dividend policy.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
Our
management, under the direction of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act)
as of June 30, 2025. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our management concluded that, as of June 30,
2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The material weaknesses previously identified in our internal control over
financial reporting have been fully remediated. The Company has implemented the necessary business processes and related internal controls
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Remediation
of Previously Identified Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual consolidated financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis.
As
previously disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, management identified material weaknesses in the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting related to (i) the control environment and certain entity-level controls, (ii) information
technology general controls, and (iii) certain financial close and reporting processes. These material weaknesses arose primarily due
to insufficient qualified personnel, ineffective segregation of duties, and a lack of appropriately designed and documented control activities.
53
Remediation
of Material Weaknesses
As
of June 30, 2025, management has completed the remediation of all previously identified material weaknesses. The following actions were
taken to remediate the deficiencies:
●
Entity-Level
Controls: We enhanced our governance and oversight structure, including increased involvement by the Board of Directors and the Audit
Committee in evaluating internal control matters. Additional accounting and compliance personnel were hired to strengthen the control
environment and provide appropriate oversight of financial reporting functions.
●
Information
Technology General Controls: We designed and implemented new user access controls, including periodic access reviews for key IT systems.
Logical access and segregation of duties were reinforced to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access. We also centralized key IT
processes and engaged third-party service providers to support certain IT functions.
●
Financial
Close and Reporting Controls: We established formal accounting policies and procedures and implemented improved management review
controls over key financial statement areas, including revenue recognition, inventory, accounts payable, payroll, income taxes, and
journal entries. Monthly and quarterly close processes were strengthened through enhanced review of journal entries, account reconciliations,
and financial analyses. We also implemented procedures to ensure the completeness and accuracy of information used in control execution.
A third-party advisor was engaged to assist with documenting transaction flows and implementing key control activities across critical
financial processes.
These
remediation activities were overseen by management and the Audit Committee, which received regular updates on progress and testing outcomes.
Management tested the design and operating effectiveness of the remediated controls, which had been in place and operating for a sufficient
period, and concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, the controls were operating effectively. As a result, management has concluded that
the previously reported material weaknesses have been fully remediated.
Ongoing
Commitment to Internal Control Excellence
Although
we have remediated the identified material weaknesses, we remain committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. We will
continue to monitor the effectiveness of our internal controls, address evolving risks, and make enhancements as necessary to support
the reliability of our financial reporting and promptly address any future risks that may arise.
54
Management’s
Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
As
required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
(1)
pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of our company,
(2)
provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance
with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors,
and
(3)
provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated
financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status
as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, and due to our non-accelerated filer status.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Company completed the implementation and testing of certain controls that had been operating
for a sufficient period to demonstrate effectiveness, as part of the remediation efforts for previously identified material weaknesses
in internal control over financial reporting. These changes did not materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
As
discussed in “Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weaknesses,” these changes included enhancements to entity-level
controls, the implementation of new user access and IT general controls, and improvements to our financial close and reporting processes.
Management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, conducted in accordance with the criteria established in
the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) and pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act, concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, these controls were
operating effectively. As a result, the previously reported material weaknesses have been fully remediated.
Item
9B. Other Information.
During
the three months ended June 30, 2025, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement”
or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
On
June 30, 2025, the Company entered into a material definitive agreement in the form of an amendment to its already existing Credit Facility
with White Oak, which reduced the applicable interest rate margin from a range of 4.5% – 4.75% to a range of 4.0% – 4.25%,
effective immediately. The Company expects the reduction in the applicable interest rate range to decrease its interest expense in future
periods.

board of directors based on his breath and depth of experience in varied investment, financing and legal roles.
Director
Independence
An
“independent director” is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries
or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would interfere with the
director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined
that Messrs. Donaldson and Nagelson and Ms. Wielenga are “independent directors” as defined in the Nasdaq listing
standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors
are present.
Committees
of the Board of Directors
Our
board of directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating committee. Subject to
phase-in rules and a limited exception, the Nasdaq listing rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee
of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and the Nasdaq listing rules require that the compensation committee
of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Each of the audit committee, the compensation committee and the nominating
committee may have as one of its members a “non-independent director” under exceptional and limited circumstances pursuant
to the exemptions under Rules 5605(c)(2)(B), 5605(d)(2)(B) and 5605(e)(3) of the Nasdaq listing rules.
Audit
Committee
Ms.
Wielenga and Mr. Nagelson serve as members of our audit committee, and Ms. Wielenga chairs the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq
listing standards and applicable SEC rules, the audit committee is required to have at least three members, all of whom must be
independent, except that the audit committee may have as one of its members a “non-independent director” under
exceptional and limited circumstances pursuant to the exemption under Rule 5605(c)(2)(B) of the Nasdaq listing rules. We expect to
appoint a third member to the Audit Committee at or prior to our annual stockholder meeting. Each member of the audit committee
meets the independent director standard under the Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange
Act.
58
Each
member of the audit committee is financially literate, and our board of directors has determined that Mr. Nagelson qualifies as an
“audit committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules.
We
have adopted an audit committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including:
●
the
appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm
engaged by us;
●
pre-approving
all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and

authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken
to deal with such issues and (iii) all relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and us to assess the
independent registered public accounting firm’s independence;
●
reviewing
the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control policies and procedures, including establishing special audit procedures in response
to any material control deficiencies;
●

and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC
prior to us entering into such transaction address any conflicts of interest;

with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory
or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published
reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting
standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities;
●
periodically
review risk management policies;
●
review,
approve and monitor code of ethics for senior officers.

and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Office’s compensation,
if any is paid by us, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer’s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining

●
if
required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and
●
reviewing,
evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.
●
The
charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation
consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the
work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or
any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required
by the SEC and any national securities exchange on which the Company is listed.
Nominating
Committee
Mr.
Donaldson, and Ms. Wielenga serve as members of the nominating committee, and Mr. Nagelson serves as chair of the nominating committee.
Under the Nasdaq listing standards, all of the directors on the nominating committee must be independent, except that the nominating
committee may, if it is comprised of at least three members, have as one of its members a “non-independent director” under
exceptional and limited circumstances pursuant to the exemption under Rule 5605(e)(3) of the Nasdaq listing rules.
The
Nominating Committee Charter, which details the purpose and responsibilities of the nominating committee, includes:
●
identifying,
screening and reviewing individuals qualified to serve as directors, consistent with criteria approved by the board, and recommending
to the board of directors candidates for nomination for election at the annual general meeting or to fill vacancies on the board
of directors;
●
developing
and recommending to the board of directors and overseeing implementation of our corporate governance guidelines;
●
coordinating
and overseeing the annual self-evaluation of the board of directors, its committees, individual directors and management in the governance
of the company; and
●
reviewing
on a regular basis our overall corporate governance and recommending improvements as and when necessary.
60
The
charter will also provide that the nominating committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of, and terminate, any
search firm to be used to identify director candidates, and will be directly responsible for approving the search firm’s fees and
other retention terms.
We
have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess.
In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors will consider educational background, diversity
of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent
the best interests of our shareholders.
Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our common stock
to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. These reporting persons are also required to furnish us with copies
of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely upon a review of such forms, we believe that during the fiscal year ended June 30,
2025, there have been no delinquent filers.
Code
of Ethics
We
have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to our directors, officers, and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal
financial officer, and principal accounting officer. The Code of Ethics is designed to promote honest and ethical conduct, full and fair
disclosure in reports and documents filed with the SEC, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Code of Ethics
was adopted on March 15, 2023.
The
Code of Ethics is posted on our website at SEC Filings – AENT .
Any
amendments to, or waivers from, certain provisions of the Code of Ethics applicable to our principal executive officer, principal financial
officer, or principal accounting officer require approval by the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee. We intend to disclose such
amendments or waivers promptly in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
No
waivers were granted during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.
Insider
Trading Policy
We
have adopted an insider trading policy (the “Trading Policy”) that is designed to promote compliance with federal securities
laws, rules, and regulations, as well as the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The Trading Policy provides Alliance’s
standards on trading and causing the trading of our securities or securities of other publicly traded companies while in possession of
confidential information. It prohibits trading in certain circumstances and applies to all of our directors, officers, and employees,
as well as independent contractors or consultants who have access to material nonpublic information of Alliance. Additionally, our Trading
Policy imposes special additional trading restrictions applicable to all of our directors and executive officers. The Trading Policy
is annexed to this Annual Report as an exhibit and the full text of the Trading Policy is available on our website at www.aent.com.

Equity
Incentive Plan Awards
In
addition to the salaries and bonus targets set forth above, each of the two Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in and
receive awards under the 2023 Plan.
Benefits
Each
of the two Named Executive Officers also has the right to receive or participate in all employee benefit programs and perquisites generally
established by the Company from time to time for employees similarly situated to the Named Executive Officer, subject to the general
eligibility requirements and other terms of such programs and perquisites, and subject to the Company’s right to amend, terminate
or take other similar action with respect to any such programs and perquisites. Each also receives approximately $2,000 per month for
an automobile lease and is entitled to first class air travel where available.
Termination;
Severance Benefits
Pursuant
to their employment agreements, in the event of a termination of such Named Executive Officer’s employment for any reason, the
executive would generally be entitled to receive earned but unpaid salary, accrued but unpaid annual bonus, any owed accrued expenses,
as well as amounts payable under any benefit plans, programs or arrangements that such Named Executive Officer participates in or benefits
therefrom. In the event that a Named Executive Officer’s employment is terminated due to his death, in addition to the foregoing,
he would be entitled to a pro-rated portion of his annual bonus, as determined by the Board.
In
the event that a Named Executive Officer’s employment is terminated either without “cause” (as defined in the applicable
employment agreement) or by the Named Executive Officer for “good reason” (as defined in the applicable employment agreement),
subject to his execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims and continued compliance with his restrictive covenant obligations,
as described below, such Named Executive Officer would be entitled to payment of an amount (i) equal to the executive’s base salary
immediately prior to the termination date (or, if for “good reason” was attributable to the Company’s failure to pay
the minimum amount of Base Salary provided herein, such minimum amount) for the period of time from the day after the Termination Date
through the last day of the employment term or for a period of twelve (12) months, whichever is greater (the “Severance Period”);
(ii) in addition to payment of any unpaid bonuses from a prior fiscal year, a pro-rata portion of the bonus based on the amount of days
executive worked for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, and (iii) payment for such Named Executive Officer’s insurance
premiums incurred for participation in COBRA coverage pursuant group health plan through the earliest to occur of (A) the last day of
the Severance Period, (B) the date the executive ceases to be eligible for COBRA or (C) such time as Executive is eligible for group
health insurance benefits from another employer.
62
Provision
of the severance benefits is conditioned on (i) the Named Executive Officer’s continued compliance in all material respects with
executive’s continuing obligations to the Company, including, without limitation, the terms of the employment agreement that survive
termination of executive’s employment with the Company, and (ii) the Named Executive Officer’s signing (without revoking
if such right is provided under applicable law) a separation agreement and general release in a form of that provided to Executive by
the Company on or about the termination date. The Named Executive Officer must so execute the separation agreement within 60 days following
the termination date.

Alliance
has established a formal arrangement to compensate certain independent directors. Under this arrangement, eligible independent directors
receive an annual fee of $50,000 for their service on the board of directors and its committees.
Equity
Plans
Our
board of directors adopted and approved the 2023 Omnibus Equity and Incentive Plan, or 2023 Plan, which was subsequently adopted by Alliance’s
stockholders. The 2023 Plan became effective on February 10, 2023, and is a comprehensive incentive compensation plan under which we
can grant equity-based and other incentive awards to based officers, employees and directors of, and consultants and advisers to, Alliance
and its subsidiaries. The purpose of the 2023 Plan is to help us attract, motivate and retain such persons with awards designed for the
U.S. market and thereby enhance shareholder value.
Grant
of Awards; Shares Available for Awards. The 2023 Plan provides for the grant of awards which are distribution equivalent rights,
incentive share options, non-qualified share options, performance shares, performance units, restricted common stock, restricted share
units, share appreciation rights (“SARs”), tandem share appreciation rights, unrestricted common stock or any combination
of the foregoing, to key management employees and non-employee directors of, and non-employee consultants of, Alliance or any of its
subsidiaries (each a “participant”) (however, solely Alliance employees or employees of Alliance subsidiaries are eligible
for awards which are incentive share options). We have reserved a total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance as or under
awards to be made under the 2023 Plan. To the extent that an award lapses, expires, is canceled, is terminated unexercised or ceases
to be exercisable for any reason, or the rights of its holder terminate, any common stock subject to such award shall again be available
for the grant of a new award. The 2023 Plan shall continue in effect, unless sooner terminated, until the tenth (10th) anniversary of
the date on which it is adopted by the Board of Directors (except as to awards outstanding on that date). The Board of Directors in its
discretion may terminate the 2023 Plan at any time with respect to any shares for which awards have not theretofore been granted; provided,
however, that the 2023 Plan’s termination shall not materially and adversely impair the rights of a holder, without the consent
of the holder, with respect to any award previously granted. The number of shares of common stock for which awards which are options
or SARs may be granted to a participant under the 2023 Plan during any calendar year is limited to a number of shares equal to three
percent (3%) of the total number of shares of common stock of the Company outstanding on the last day of the prior calendar year. Future
new hires, non- employee directors and additional non-employee consultants are eligible to participate in the 2023 Plan as well. The
number of awards to be granted to officers, non-employee directors, employees and non-employee consultants cannot be determined at this
time as the grant of awards is dependent upon various factors such as hiring requirements and job performance.
63
Options.
The term of each share option shall be as specified in the option agreement; provided, however, that except for share options which are
incentive share options (“ISOs”), granted to an employee who owns or is deemed to own (by reason of the attribution rules
applicable under Code Section 424(d)) more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock or the capital stock
of our subsidiaries (a “ten percent shareholder”), no option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten years from
the date of its grant (five (5) years for an employee who is a ten percent shareholder).
The
price at which a share may be purchased upon exercise of a share option shall be determined by the Plan Committee; provided, however,
that such option price (i) shall not be less than the fair market value of a share on the date such share option is granted, and (ii)
shall be subject to adjustment as provided in the 2023 Plan. The Plan Committee or the board of directors shall determine the time or
times at which or the circumstances under which a share option may be exercised in whole or in part, the time or times at which options
shall cease to be or become exercisable following termination of the share option holder’s employment or upon other conditions,
the methods by which such exercise price may be paid or deemed to be paid, the form of such payment, and the methods by or forms in which
common stock will be delivered or deemed to be delivered to participants who exercise share options.
Options
which are ISOs shall comply in all respects with Section 422 of the Code. In the case of ISOs granted to a ten percent shareholder, the
per share exercise price under such ISO (to the extent required by the Code at the time of grant) shall be no less than 110% of the fair
market value of a share on the date such ISO is granted. ISOs may only be granted to employees of Alliance or one of its subsidiaries.
In addition, the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to an ISO (determined at the time of grant) which are exercisable
for the first time by an employee during any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. An Option which specifies that it is not intended
to qualify as ISOs or any Option that fails to meet the requirement of an ISO at any point in time will automatically be treated as a
nonqualified option (“NQSO”) under the terms of the Plan.
Restricted
Share Awards. A restricted share award is a grant or sale of common stock to the participant, subject to such restrictions on transferability,
risk of forfeiture and other restrictions, if any, as the Plan Committee or the board of directors may impose, which restrictions may
lapse separately or in combination at such times, under such circumstances (including based on achievement of performance goals and/or
future service requirements), in such installments or otherwise, as the Plan Committee or the board of directors may determine at the
date of grant or purchase or thereafter. Except to the extent restricted under the terms of the 2023 Plan and any agreement relating
to the restricted share award, a participant who is granted or has purchased restricted shares shall have all of the rights of a shareholder,
including the right to vote the restricted shares and the right to receive dividends thereon (subject to any mandatory reinvestment or
other requirement imposed by the Plan Committee or the Board of Directors or in the award agreement). During the restricted period applicable
to the restricted shares, subject to certain exceptions, the restricted shares may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, or
otherwise disposed of by the participant.
Unrestricted
Share Awards. An unrestricted share award is the award of common stock which is not subject to transfer restrictions. Pursuant to
the terms of the applicable unrestricted share award agreement, a holder may be awarded (or sold) common stock which are not subject
to transfer restrictions, in consideration for past services rendered thereby to us or an affiliate or for other valid consideration.
Restricted
Share Unit Awards. A restricted share unit award provides for a cash payment to be made to the holder upon the satisfaction of predetermined
individual service-related vesting requirements, based on the number of units awarded to the holder. The Plan Committee shall set forth
in the applicable restricted share unit award agreement the individual service-based or performance-based vesting requirement which the
holder would be required to satisfy before the holder would become entitled to payment and the number of units awarded to the Holder.
The vesting restrictions under any restricted share unit award shall constitute a “substantial risk of forfeiture” under
Section 409A of the Code. At the time of such an award, the Plan Committee may, in its sole discretion, prescribe additional terms and
conditions or restrictions. The holder of a restricted share unit shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market
value of a share, or one (1) share, as determined in the sole discretion of the Plan Committee and as set forth in the restricted share
unit award agreement, for each restricted share unit subject to such restricted share unit award, if and to the extent the applicable
vesting requirement is satisfied. Such payment shall be made no later than by the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) calendar month
next following the end of the calendar year in which the restricted share unit first becomes vested.
64
Performance
Unit Awards. A performance unit award provides for a cash payment to be made to the holder upon the satisfaction of predetermined
individual and/or Alliance performance goals or objectives, based on the number of units awarded to the holder. The Plan Committee shall
set forth in the applicable performance unit award agreement the performance goals and objectives (and the period of time to which such
goals and objectives shall apply) which the holder and/or Alliance would be required to satisfy before the holder would become entitled
to payment, the number of units awarded to the holder and the dollar value assigned to each such unit. The vesting restrictions under
any performance under award shall constitute a “substantial risk of forfeiture” under Section 409A of the Code. At the time
of such an award, the Plan Committee may, in its sole discretion, prescribe additional terms and conditions or restrictions. The holder
of a performance unit shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the dollar value assigned to such unit under the applicable
performance unit award agreement if the holder and/or Alliance satisfy (or partially satisfy, if applicable under the applicable performance
unit award agreement) the performance goals and objectives set forth in such performance unit award agreement.
If
achieved, such payment shall be made no later than by the 15th day of the third calendar month following the end of Alliance’s
fiscal year to which such performance goals and objectives relate.
Performance
Share Awards. A performance share award provides for distribution of common stock to the holder upon the satisfaction of predetermined
individual and/or Alliance goals or objectives. The Plan Committee shall set forth in the applicable performance share award agreement
the performance goals and objectives (and the period of time to which such goals and objectives shall apply) which the holder and/or
Alliance would be required to satisfy before the holder would become entitled to the receipt of common stock pursuant to such holder’s
performance share award and the number of shares of common stock subject to such performance share award. The vesting restrictions under
any performance under award shall constitute a “substantial risk of forfeiture” under Section 409A of the Code and, if such
goals and objectives are achieved, the distribution of such common stock shall be made no later than by the 15th day of the 3rd calendar
month next following the end of our fiscal year to which such goals and objectives relate. At the time of such an award, the Plan Committee
may, in its sole discretion, prescribe additional terms and conditions or restrictions. The holder of a performance share award shall
have no rights as an Alliance shareholder until such time, if any, as the holder actually receives common stock pursuant to the performance
share award.
Distribution
Equivalent Rights. A distribution equivalent right entitles the holder to receive bookkeeping credits, cash payment and/or share
distributions equal in amount to the distributions that would be made to the holder had the holder held a specified number of common
stock during the period the holder held the distribution equivalent rights. The Plan Committee shall set forth in the applicable distribution
equivalent rights award agreement the terms and conditions, if any, including whether the holder is to receive credits currently in cash,
is to have such credits reinvested (at fair market value determined as of the date of reinvestment) in additional common stock or is
to be entitled to choose among such alternatives. Such receipt shall be subject to a “substantial risk of forfeiture” under
Section 409A of the Code and, if such award becomes vested, the distribution of such cash or common stock shall be made no later than
by the 15th day of the third calendar month next following the end of the Company’s fiscal year in which the holder’s interest
in the award vests. Distribution equivalent rights awards may be settled in cash or in common stock, as set forth in the applicable distribution
equivalent rights award agreement. A distribution equivalent rights award may, but need not be, awarded in tandem with another award
other than an Option or SAR award, whereby, if so awarded, such distribution equivalent rights award shall terminate or be forfeited
by the holder, as applicable, under the same conditions as under such other award. The distribution equivalent rights award agreement
for a distribution equivalent rights award may provide for the crediting of interest on a distribution rights award to be settled in
cash at a future date (but in no event later than by the 15th day of the third calendar month next following the end of the Company’s
fiscal year in which such interest was credited), at a rate set forth in the applicable distribution equivalent rights award agreement,
on the amount of cash payable thereunder.
Share
Appreciation Rights. A SAR provides the participant to whom it is granted the right to receive, upon its exercise, the excess of
(A) the fair market value of the number of shares of common stock subject to the SAR on the date of exercise, over (B) the product of
the number of shares of common stock subject to the SAR multiplied by the base value under the SAR, as determined by the Plan Committee
or the board of directors. The base value of a SAR shall not be less than the fair market value of a share on the date of the grant.
If the Plan Committee grants a share appreciation right which is intended to be a tandem SAR, additional restrictions apply.
65
Amendment
and Termination. The 2023 Plan shall continue in effect, unless sooner terminated pursuant to its terms, until February 10, 2033,
the tenth anniversary of the date on which it is adopted by the Board of Directors (except as to awards outstanding on that date).
As
of June 30, 2025, a total of 561,300 awards have been granted under the 2023 Plan.
Bonus
Incentive Plan
In
fiscal year 2024, the Company updated its cash Bonus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) designed to align leadership compensation
with the Company’s financial performance, specifically its growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
(“EBITDA”). The Plan is structured as follows:
The
Plan applies to executives and leaders as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The bonus payout under
the Plan is directly linked to the Company’s EBITDA growth year-over-year. The Plan uses the percentage increase in the Company’s
EBITDA for the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year as the performance metric.
A
full payout of the cash bonus will occur if the Company’s EBITDA for the current fiscal year increases by 10% or more compared
to the prior year’s EBITDA. For EBITDA growth below 10%, the bonus payout is pro rata down to 1% of the bonus amount based on the
percentage increase in EBITDA.
10%
or greater EBITDA increase: 100% bonus payout.
9%
EBITDA increase: 90% bonus payout.
8%
EBITDA increase: 80% bonus payout.
This
pattern continues, with a 10% reduction in payout for every 1% decrease in EBITDA growth. No bonus will be paid if EBITDA growth is less
than 1%.
Bonuses
earned under the Plan, if any, will be paid in the first quarter of the following fiscal year, after the Company’s financial results
for the relevant year are finalized and audited. The Compensation Committee retains the discretion to adjust the final bonus payouts
in the event of extraordinary or non-recurring items that materially affect the Company’s reported EBITDA. The Company will accrue
bonuses based on its estimated performance to the Plan’s EBITDA targets throughout the fiscal year.
Clawback
Policy
The
Board has adopted a clawback policy which allows us to recover performance-based compensation, whether cash or equity, from a current
or former executive officer in the event of an Accounting Restatement. The clawback policy defines an Accounting Restatement as an accounting
restatement of our financial statements due to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities
laws. Under such policy, we may recoup incentive-based compensation previously received by an executive officer that exceeds the amount
of incentive-based compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts in the Accounting
Restatement.
The
Board has the sole discretion to determine the form and timing of the recovery, which may include repayment, forfeiture and/or an adjustment
to future performance-based compensation payouts or awards. The remedies under the clawback policy are in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any legal and equitable claims available to the Company. The clawback policy is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report as an exhibit.
Equity Compensation Policy and Practices
While we do not have a formal written
policy in place with regard to the timing of awards of options in relation to the disclosure of material nonpublic information, the Compensation
Committee does not seek to time equity grants to take advantage of information, either positive or negative, about our company that has
not been publicly disclosed. It has been our practice to grant equity awards to our officers and directors upon their appointment. We
intend to issue equity grants to our officers and/or directors at the same time each year, in connection with our first meeting of the
Board of Directors each fiscal year. Option grants are effective on the date the award determination is made by the Compensation Committee,
and the exercise price of options is the closing market price of our Common Stock on the business day of the grant or, if the grant is
made on a weekend or holiday, on the prior business day.
During the fiscal year ended June 30,
2025, we did not award any options to a named executive officer in the period beginning four business days before the filing of a periodic
report on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, or the filing or furnishing of a current report on Form 8-K that discloses material nonpublic information,
and ending one business day after the filing or furnishing of such report.
Alliance Indemnification
Agreements
In connection with the IPO, Alliance entered into agreements with its officers and directors to provide contractual
indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in its certificate of incorporation. Alliance also purchased a policy
of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that insures its officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement
or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures Alliance against its obligations to indemnify its officers and directors.
Item
12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
The
information included under the heading “Equity Plans” in Item 11 and Part III of this annual report is hereby incorporated
by reference into this Item 12 of Part II of this annual report.
66
The
following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our Class A common stock as of the date of this annual report,
by:
●
each
person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock;
●
each
of our executive officers and directors; and
●
all
our executive officers and directors as a group.
Beneficial
ownership is determined according to the rules of the SEC, which generally provide that a person has beneficial ownership of a security
if he, she or it possesses sole or shared voting or investment power over that security, including options and warrants that are currently
exercisable or exercisable within 60 days. Except as described in the footnotes below and subject to applicable community property laws
and similar laws, we believe that each person listed below has sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares.

beneficial ownership percentages set forth in the table below are based on 50,957,370 shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding
as of September 10, 2024.

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.
Registration
Rights Agreement
The
holders of the Initial Stockholder Shares and private warrants (and in each case holders of their underlying securities, as applicable)
have registration rights to require us to register a sale of any of our securities held by them pursuant to a registration rights agreement
that was signed on February 8, 2021. This agreement provided that these holders are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short
form registration demands, that we register such securities for sale under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders were granted
“piggy-back” registration rights to include their securities in other registration statements filed by us.
In
connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Adara Initial Stockholders and the Legacy Alliance stockholders entered
into the Registration Rights Agreement, which amended and restated the former registration rights agreement. Pursuant to the Registration
Rights Agreement, Alliance filed a resale registration statement, and it was declared effective in accordance with the terms of the registration
statement. In certain circumstances, the Adara Initial Stockholders and the Legacy Alliance stockholders may each demand up to two registrations,
which may be underwritten offerings, and all of the registration rights holders will be entitled to piggyback registration rights.
Alliance
Related Party Transactions
GameFly
Holdings, LLC
During
the years ended June 30, 2025, and 2024, Alliance has made sales of new release movies, video games, and video game consoles to GameFly
Holdings LLC in the amount of $2.7 million and $8.4 million, respectively. GameFly, a customer of Alliance, is equally owned by Bruce
Ogilvie and Jeff Walker, the two shareholders of Alliance. Alliance believes the amounts that GameFly paid for New Release, movies, video
games, and video game consoles are at fair market value. GameFly does fulfillment services of fast selling new releases by providing
3PL services at market rates. The agreement between Alliance and GameFly can be terminated by either party at any time. GameFly is free
to purchase from any competitor of Alliance.
On
February 1, 2023, Alliance entered into a Distribution Agreement (the “Agreement”) with GameFly, which is effective from
February 1, 2023, through March 31, 2028. At that time, the Agreement continues indefinitely until either party provides the other party
with six-month advance notice to terminate it. During the year ended June 30, 2025, and 2024, Alliance had distribution revenue in the
amount of $0 and $0.25 million respectively.
68
MVP
Logistics, LLC
MVP
Logistics is an independent contractor, which, prior to August 31, 2023, was partially owned by Joe Rehak, the SVP of Operations of COKeM
International Limited, which Alliance acquired in September 2020. Subsequent to August 31, 2023, Mr. Rehak no longer has an equity stake
in MVP Logistics and retired from COKeM in January 2024. Alliance believes the amounts payable to MVP Logistics are at fair market value.
During
the years ended June 30, 2025, and 2024 Alliance incurred costs with MVP Logistics, LLC, in the amount of $0 , and $1.0 million, respectively,
for freight shipping fees, transportation costs, warehouse distribution, and 3PL management services (for Arcades) at the Santa Fe Springs,
California and South Gate, California distribution facilities.
Ogilvie
Loans
On
July 3, 2023, the Company entered into a $17 million line of credit (the “Ogilvie Loan”) with Bruce Ogilvie, a principal
stockholder. Initial borrowings amounted to $10 million on that date, followed by an additional $5 million on July 10, 2023. These sums
were repaid on July 26, 2023. Subsequently, on August 10, 2023, the Company accessed the Ogilvie Loan for the full $17 million, repaying
$7 million on August 28, 2023. Further transactions occurred on September 14, 2023, with a borrowing of $7 million, repaid on September
28, 2023. On October 10, 2023, an additional $7 million was borrowed and repaid on October 18, 2023. As of June 30, 2025, and June 30,
2024, the outstanding balance on the Ogilvie Loan was $10 million.
The
Ogilvie Loan is subordinated to the Company’s revolving credit facility, meaning that in the event of liquidation or default, repayment
of the Ogilvie Loan is subordinate to amounts outstanding under the Company’s debt arrangements.
The
Ogilvie Loan matures on December 22, 2026, and bears interest at the rate of the 30-day SOFR plus 5.5% (4.34% and 5.29% at June 30, 2025,
and June 30, 2024, respectively). Interest expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, and 2024 were $1.0 million each. The interest
rate on June 30, 2025, and 2024, was 9.80% and 10.8% respectively.
B&D
Capital Partners, LLC
During
the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, Alliance Entertainment Holding Corporation (the “Company”) entered into a financial
advisory agreement with B&D Capital Partners, LLC (“BDCP”). Donaldson, a director of the company, is managing partner
and a principal equity holder of Blystone & Donaldson, the parent company of BDPC. The agreement, dated July 28, 2023, engaged BDCP
as a non-exclusive financial advisor to assist the Company in issuing privately held debt securities and related transactions. BDCP is
owned by Blystone & Donaldson, LLC, and Mr. Donaldson, an independent director of the Company, is a principal of BDCP.
Under
the terms of the agreement, BDCP provided financial advisory services, including the review of confidential information, identification
and engagement of potential transaction parties, and assistance with investor presentations.
During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Company did not incur any related party fees with BDCP. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024,
the Company paid BDCP approximately $1.8 million, which included an advisory fee equal to 1.5% of the gross proceeds from transactions
involving White Oak Commercial Finance, LLC.
Policies
and Procedures for Related Person Transactions
Our
board of directors adopted a related person transaction policy setting forth the policies and procedures for the identification, review
and approval or ratification of related person transactions. This policy covers, with certain exceptions set forth in Item 404 of Regulation
S-K under the Securities Act, any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships,
in which we and a related person were or will be participants and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, including purchases of goods
or services by or from the related person or entities in which the related person has a material interest, indebtedness and guarantees
of indebtedness. In reviewing and approving any such transactions, our audit committee will consider all relevant facts and circumstances
as appropriate, such as the purpose of the transaction, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services, whether
the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in an arm’s length transaction, management’s recommendation
with respect to the proposed related person transaction, and the extent of the related person’s interest in the transaction.
69
Director
Independence
An
“independent director” is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries
or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would interfere with the
director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined
that Messrs. Donaldson, Finke, and Nagelson and Ms. Wielenga are “independent directors” as defined in the Nasdaq listing
standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors
are present.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To

Stockholders of Alliance
Entertainment Holding Corporation
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alliance Entertainment Holding Corporation (the Company) as of June 30,
2025, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for the year ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30,
2025, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis
for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Grassi
& Co., CPAs, P.C.
We
have served as the Company’s auditor since 2024.

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Alliance Entertainment Holding Corporation (the “Company”) as
of June 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and
cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
at June 30, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis
for Opinion
These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We
served as the Company’s auditor from 2021 to 2024.

Note
1: Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Alliance
Entertainment Holding Corporation (“Alliance”) was formed on August 9, 2010. The Company provides full-service distribution
of pre-recorded music, video movies, video games and related accessories, and merchandising to retailers and other independent customers
primarily in the United States. It provides product and commerce solutions to “brick-and-mortar”, e-commerce retailers, and
consumer direct websites, while maintaining trading relationships with manufacturers of pre-recorded music, video movies, video games
and related accessories.
On
February 10, 2023, Alliance completed its business combination with Adara Acquisition Corp., which was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization
with Alliance treated as the accounting acquirer. The recapitalization has been retroactively reflected in all periods presented. The
Company continues to recognize certain warrant and equity-related impacts from this transaction, including the outstanding Class E contingent
shares and warrant liabilities, as discussed further in Notes 15 and 20.
A
summary of the significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:
Reclassification
Certain
amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Basis
of Presentation
The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alliance Entertainment
Holding Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Liquidity
On
December 21, 2023, the Company entered into a new three3-year
credit facility with White Oak Commercial Finance, LLC, which will mature on December 21, 2026. The facility is a $120
million asset-based revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit
Facility”). Additionally, the Company has implemented certain strategic
initiatives to reduce expenses and focus on the sale of higher margin products. As a result of the new credit facility, combined
with these initiatives and the Company’s financial performance for the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company has concluded
that it has sufficient cash to fund its operations and obligations (from its cash on hand, operations, working capital and
availability on the credit facility) for at least twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated financial
statements.
F-8
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company enters into contracts with its customers for the purchase of products in the ordinary course of business. A contract with commercial
substance exists once the Company receives and accepts a purchase order under a sales contract. Payment terms on invoiced amounts generally
range from 0 to 90 days. Revenue from the sale and distribution of pre-recorded music, video, games, accessories, and other related products
are recognized when the performance obligations under the terms of a contract with its customer are satisfied, which occurs with the
transfer of control of the product. For the majority of the Company’s products, control is transferred, and revenue is recognized
when the product is shipped from the Company’s distribution center to the Company’s customers, which primarily consist of
retailers. For most of the Company’s distribution contracts, the Company is considered to be the principal to these transactions,
and the revenue is recognized on a gross basis, since the Company is the primary obligor for fulfilling the promise to its customers
on these arrangements, has inventory risk, and has latitude in establishing prices. In limited circumstances, the Company has
determined that it acts as an agent (ASC 606-10-55-36 through 55-40) because it does not control the specified goods before they are
transferred to the customer. For these arrangements, revenue is recognized on a net basis, reflecting only the fee or commission to which
the Company is entitled in exchange for arranging the sale.
Additionally, the Company ships some of its products
to retailers on a consignment basis. The Company retains ownership of its products stored at these retailers. As the Company’s
products are sold by the retailer, ownership is transferred from the Company to the retailer. At that time, the Company invoices the
retailer and recognizes revenue for these consignment transactions. If a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the
transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price. Shipping and handling activities
are treated as a fulfillment activity rather than a promised service, and therefore, are not considered a performance obligation. Sales,
use, value-added, and other excise taxes the Company collects concurrent with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue.
Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense when incurred.
The
Company applies ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (ASC 606) utilizing the following allowable exemptions or practical
expedients:
●
Portfolio
approach practical expedient relative to the estimation of variable consideration.
●
Shipping
and handling practical expedient to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related good transfers
as fulfillment activities.
●
Costs
of obtaining a contract practical expedient to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred
if the amortization period of the asset is one year or less.
●
Sales
taxes practical expedient to exclude sales taxes and other similar taxes from the transaction price.
●
Significant
financing component practical expedient
Revenue
is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled to receive. When determining the transaction price, the
Company estimates variable consideration by applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The primary sources of
variable consideration for the Company are rebate programs, incentive programs and product returns. The rebate and incentives are recorded
as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale or when offered. The Company estimates variable consideration related to products
sold under its rebate and incentive programs using the expected value method, which is based on sales terms with customers, historical
experience, inventory levels, volume purchases, and known changes in relevant trends in the future. There are no material instances where
variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale.
Substantially
all of the Company’s sales are domestic and are made to customers under agreements permitting certain limited rights of return
based upon the prior months’ sales and vendor return rights. Except for video games and vinyl sales, which are not returnable,
generally it is the Company’s policy not to accept product returns that cannot be returned to the Company’s vendors. Revenue
from product sales is recognized net of estimated returns. Sales in the pre-recorded music and video movies industry generally give certain
customers the right to return products. In addition, the Company’s suppliers generally permit the Company to return products that
are in the supplier’s current product listing, except for video games and vinyl.
F-9
Based
on historical returns, review of current catalog list and the change of mass merchant’s floor space and store locations carrying
the Company’s products, management provides for estimated net returns at the time of sale and other specific reserves when appropriate.
This is typically done using a twelve-month average return rate by product.
The
Company has determined that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are most significantly affected by
the overall economic health of the consumer product industry in the United States.
Cash
Cash
includes all investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit
accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
Trade
Receivables, Net
The
Company grants credit to customers on credit terms in the ordinary course of business. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of a
customer’s financial condition, and collateral is generally not required. Trade receivables are carried at the original invoice
amount less estimates made for allowances for credit losses based on a periodic review of all outstanding amounts. Management
measures all expected losses based on a forward-looking expected loss model, which reflects probable losses based on historical experience,
current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Trade receivables are written off against the allowance when they are deemed
uncollectable. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded as a credit to the allowance for uncollectable accounts
when received.
Escrow
Receivable
As
of June 30, 2025, the Company had $8.5 million held in escrow related to a terminated acquisition transaction. The Company does not have
access to or control over the escrow account, and the acquisition did not proceed. The funds are classified as a receivable within Other
Current Assets, and the Company is actively pursuing return of the escrowed funds. Management believes the balance is recoverable within
the next 12 months.
Inventory
and Inventory Reserves
Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost, using the weighted average cost method, or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Excess
or obsolete inventory reserves that reduce the cost basis of the assets are established when inventory is estimated to not be sellable
or returnable to suppliers based on product demand and product life cycle.
Property
and Equipment, Net
Property
and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line
method over the asset’s estimated useful life. Costs of major additions and improvements are capitalized, while repair and maintenance
costs are charged to expense as incurred. When items are disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts,
and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
Depreciation
and Amortization
Depreciation
is provided in amounts sufficient to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives using the
straight-line method. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Schedule of Estimated Useful Lives
Asset Class
Useful Life
Leasehold Improvements
5 – 10 years
Machinery and Equipment
3 – 7 years
Furniture and Fixtures
5 – 7 years
Capitalized Software
1 – 3 years
Equipment Under Finance Leases
5-7 years
Computer Equipment
2 – 5 years
Leasehold
improvements and equipment under financed ROU leases are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the life of the
lease.
F-10
Goodwill
and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets, Net
Goodwill
is assessed using either a qualitative assessment or quantitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair
value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. The qualitative assessment evaluates factors including macroeconomic conditions,
industry-specific and company-specific considerations, legal and regulatory environments, and historical performance. If the Company
determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment
is performed. Otherwise, no further assessment is required. The quantitative approach compares the estimated fair value of the reporting
units to it carrying amount, including goodwill. Impairment is indicated if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than
the carrying amount of the reporting unit, and an impairment charge is recognized for the differential.
The
Company completes its annual goodwill impairment tests in the fourth quarter, or whenever there are indicators that the fair value of
the reporting unit might be less than the carrying amount. For the years ended June 30, 2025, and 2024, the Company did not record any
impairment.
Definite-Lived
intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization of customer relationships and lists is recorded
using an accelerated method over the useful lives of the related assets, which range from 10
to 15
years. Covenants not to compete and trade names are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets, which range from 5
to 15
years.
Indefinite-lived
intangible assets, such as certain trade names, are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. For the years ended June 30, 205 and 2024 the company did not record any impairment.
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
Recoverability
of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets are evaluated whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors considered important which could trigger an impairment
review include but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant
changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business, significant decrease in the market value of the
assets and significant negative industry or economic trends. In the event the carrying amount of the long-lived assets may not be recoverable
based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted
cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual deposition. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum
of the estimated future undiscounted cash flow, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over
its fair value. There was no impairment during the years ended June 30, 2025, and 2024.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Significant
estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements include management’s estimates of
sales returns reserve, warrants fair value, customer rebates and discount reserves, goodwill impairment, and inventory valuation. On an ongoing basis,
management evaluates its estimates compared to historical experience and trends, which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying value of assets and liabilities.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company complies with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure requirements about fair
value measurements. Under ASC 820, there are three categories for the classification and measurement of assets and liabilities carried
at fair value:
Level
1: Valuation based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Since valuations are based on quoted
prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree
of judgment. Examples include publicly traded equity securities and publicly traded mutual funds that are actively traded on a major
exchange or over-the-counter market.
F-11
Level
2: Valuation based on quoted market prices of investments that are not actively traded or for which certain significant inputs are not
observable, either directly or indirectly. Examples include municipal bonds, where fair value is estimated using recently executed transactions,
bid asked prices and pricing models that factor in, where applicable, interest rates, bond spreads and volatility.
Level
3: Valuation based on inputs that are unobservable and reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use
as fair value. Examples include limited partnerships and private equity investments.
The
estimated fair value of cash, trade receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities are based on Level
1 inputs as the fair values approximate carrying amounts as of June 30, 2025, and 2024, based on the short-term nature and maturity of
these instruments.
The
estimated fair values of subordinated shareholder debt and the credit facility is based on Level 2 inputs, which consist of interest
rates that are currently available to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. As of June 30, 2025,
and 2024 the estimated fair value of the Company’s short and long-term debt approximates it carrying value due to market interest
rates charged on such debt or their short-term maturities.
The
estimated fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of
Think3Fold were measured using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs.
The
estimated fair value of warrants, and contingent shares is determined based on various valuation methodologies, including the Black-Scholes
option pricing model and other appropriate valuation techniques. These methodologies consider factors such as the exercise price, expected
volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rate.
Warrants
Management
evaluates all of the Company’s financial instruments, including warrants issued to purchase its Class A Common Stock, to determine
if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480, Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity and ASC 815-15, Derivatives and Hedging-Embedded Derivatives. The classification of derivative instruments,
including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is assessed at issuance of the financial instrument
and re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.
As
a result of the Merger, the Company initially had 5,750,000 Public Warrants, 4,120,000 Private Placement Warrants, and 50,090 Representative
Warrants issued that are exercisable to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock. The Public Warrants qualify for the derivative scope
exception under ASC 815 and are therefore presented as a component of Stockholders’ Equity on the consolidated balance sheets without
subsequent fair value re-measurement.
The
Private Placement Warrants and Representative Warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40. Accordingly,
the Company recognizes the Private Placement Warrants and Representative Warrants as liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance
sheets with the warrant liabilities subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value
recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
The
Company re-computes the fair value of the Private and the Representative Warrants at the issuance date and the end of each quarterly
reporting period. Such value computation includes subjective input assumptions that are consistently applied each period. If the Company
were to alter its assumptions or the numbers input based on such assumptions, the resulting fair value could be materially different.
Refer to Note 20, Warrants and Note 21, Fair Value for additional details of the Warrants and related valuation.

Earnings
per Share
Basic
Earnings Per Share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted EPS takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue shares,
such as stock options, warrants, and unvested restricted stock units, were exercised and converted into common shares and the impact
would not be antidilutive. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average shares
outstanding during the period, increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if the potential shares
had been issued and were dilutive. Contingently issuable shares are included in basic net loss per share only when there is no circumstance
under which those shares would not be issued.
The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net earnings per share of Common Stock for the years ended June
30, 2025, and 2024 respectively:

there are 9,920,090 warrants outstanding that have been excluded from diluted earnings per share because they are anti-dilutive. For
the year ended June 30, 2025, there are also 9,920,090 warrants outstanding and 660,000 restricted shares that have been excluded from
diluted earnings per share because they are anti-dilutive.
Advertising
Costs
Advertising
costs, which consist primarily of mailers, catalogs, online marketing and other promotions, are expensed in the period in which the advertisement
or promotion occurs. Additionally, the Company maintains cooperative advertising agreements with certain vendors to include their logos
and product descriptions prominently in the catalogs and calendars. The fee revenues charged to the vendors for the cooperative advertising
arrangements are recorded as a reduction of advertising expense and any excess fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold.
Advertising costs, which are included as selling, general and administrative expenses, were $7.7 million and $7.3 million for the years
ended June 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively.
Deferred
Financing Costs
Deferred
financing costs relating to the Company’s revolving credit facility are deferred and amortized ratably over the life of the
debt using the straight-line method. Deferred financing costs are included as an addition to interest expense on the consolidated
statements of income and comprehensive income and are included in Revolving Credit Facility, Net on the consolidated
balance sheets.
F-13
Shipping
and Handling
The
Company accounts for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities. As such, the Company does not evaluate shipping and
handling as promised services to its customers. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income and comprehensive income.
Foreign
Currency Translation and Transactions
The
financial position and results of operations of the Company’s foreign subsidiary is measured using the local currency as the
functional currency. Assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rate in
effect at each period end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period.
Foreign currency translation income (loss) totaled $3
thousand and ($2)
thousand for the years ended June 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively.
The
Company does not typically hedge its foreign exchange rate position. Realized gains or losses from foreign currency transactions are
included in operations as incurred.
Business
Combinations — Valuation of Acquired Assets and Liabilities Assumed
The
Company allocates the purchase price for each business combination, or acquired business, based upon (i) the fair value of the consideration
paid and (ii) the fair value of net assets acquired, and liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of net assets acquired
and liabilities assumed requires estimates and judgements of future cash flow expectations for the acquired business and the allocation
of those cash flows to identifiable tangible and intangible assets. Fair values are calculated by applying estimates related to Internal
Rate of Return (IRR) and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) assumptions as well as incorporating expected cash flows into industry
standard valuation techniques. Goodwill is the amount by which the purchase price consideration exceeds the fair value of tangible and
intangible assets acquired, less assumed liabilities.
Intangible
assets, such as customer relationships and trade names, when identified, are separately recognized and amortized over their estimated
useful lives, if considered definite lived. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and are included in the consolidated statements
of income and comprehensive income.
Leases
The
Company is a lessee in multiple noncancelable operating and financing leases. If the contract provides the Company with the right to
substantially all the economic benefits and the right to direct the use of the identified asset, it is generally considered to be or
contain a lease. Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value
of the future lease payments over the expected lease term. The ROU asset is also adjusted for any lease prepayments made, lease incentives
received, and initial direct costs incurred.
The
lease liability is initially and subsequently recognized based on the present value of its future lease payments. Variable payments are
included in the future lease payments when those variable payments depend on an index or a rate. Increases (decreases) to variable lease
payments due to subsequent changes in an index or rate are recorded as variable lease expense (income) in the future period in which
they are incurred.
The
discount rate used is the implicit rate in the lease contract, if it is readily determinable, or the Company’s incremental borrowing
rate. The Company uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date for all leases. The
Company’s incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow
an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms and in a similar economic environment.
F-14
The
ROU asset for operating leases is subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the amount of the remeasured lease liability (i.e.,
present value of the remaining lease payments), plus unamortized initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments,
less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received, and any impairment recognized. Operating leases with fluctuating lease payments:
For operating leases with lease payments that fluctuate over the lease term, the total lease costs are recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. The ROU asset for finance leases is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
For
all underlying classes of assets, the Company has elected the practical expedient to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities
for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease commencement and do not include an option to purchase the
underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. Leases containing termination clauses in which either party may
terminate the lease without cause and the notice period is less than 12 months are generally deemed short-term leases with lease
costs included in short- term lease expense. The Company recognizes short-term lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease
term.
Variable
Interest Entity
The
Company evaluates its ownership, contractual, and other interests in entities to determine if it has any variable interest in a variable
interest entity (VIE). These evaluations are complex, involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical
information, among other factors. If the Company determines that an entity in which it holds a contractual, or ownership, interest is
a VIE and that the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates such entity in its consolidated financial statements.
The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most
significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits
that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Management performs ongoing reassessments of whether changes in the
facts and circumstances regarding the Company’s involvement with a VIE will cause the consolidation conclusion to change.
Changes
in consolidation status are applied prospectively. The Company evaluated its transactions with a related party included in Note 13 and
concluded that the arrangements do not result in variable interests and do not require consolidation of any of the related party entities.

Segments
Operating
segments are defined as components of an enterprise where discrete financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the
chief operating decision maker or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s
chief operating decision makers (CEO and Executive Chairman) manage the business, allocate resources, and assess performance on a consolidated
basis. Accordingly, the Company has one operating and reportable segment.
Accounting
Pronouncements
Recently
Issued and Adopted Pronouncements
In
November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. ASU 2023-07 requires public entities to disclose significant
segment expense categories that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included in the
measure of segment profit or loss, as well as the title and position of the CODM. The amendments also require disclosure of all annual
segment profit or loss and asset disclosures in interim periods and provide expanded disclosure requirements for entities with a single
reportable segment.
ASU
2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company
adopted ASU 2023-07 for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, in accordance with the required effective date for non-accelerated filers.
The adoption did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows; however, it resulted
in enhanced segment disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting.
These enhancements include the identification of significant segment expense categories, disclosure of the measures of segment profit
or loss used by the CODM, related reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure, and expanded disclosures for entities with a single
reportable segment.
Prior
period comparative disclosures have been updated to conform to the current year presentation. The Company will include comparable disclosures
in its interim financial statements beginning with the quarter ending September 30, 2025.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2024-01, which introduces updates to accounting standards related to the classification
and measurement of financial instruments under ASC 320. The update primarily focuses on clarifying guidance for equity securities, debt
instruments, and other financial assets, particularly in the areas of fair value measurement and impairment recognition. It aims to improve
consistency and comparability in the reporting of financial instruments by refining the criteria for classifying securities and enhancing
the methodology for recognizing and measuring impairments. ASU 2024- 01 also mandates additional disclosures to provide greater transparency
around the valuation techniques and assumptions used in determining the fair value of financial instruments. The update is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
this ASU on its financial statements and disclosures.

8: Revolving Credit Facility
On
December 21, 2023, the Company entered into a new credit facility with White Oak Commercial Finance, LLC, which will mature on December
21, 2026. The facility is a $120 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Borrowings
under the Revolving Credit facility bear interest at the 30-day SOFR rate, subject to a floor of 2%, plus a margin ranging from 4.00%
to 4.25%, depending on the Company’s utilization and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. The 30-day SOFR rates as of June
30, 2025, and June 30, 2024, were 4.35% and 5.29%, respectively. The effective interest rates at June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2024, were
9.2% and 9.5%, respectively.
On
June 30, 2025, the Company entered into an amendment to its Credit Facility with White Oak, which reduced the applicable interest rate
margin from a range of 4.5% – 4.75% to a range of 4.0% – 4.25%, effective immediately. The Company expects the reduction
in the applicable interest rate range to decrease its interest expense in future periods.
If
the Company reduces or terminates the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility before its maturity, it will incur an early termination
fee of 1% if done between December 21, 2024, and August 21, 2025. As of August 21, 2025, the Company is no longer subject to any early
termination fees.
Availability
under the Revolving Credit Facility is determined by the Company’s borrowing base calculation, as defined in the credit agreement
relating to this facility. The Company also incurs a commitment fee of 0.25% for unused credit line with fees for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2024, of $0.22 million and $0.15 million, respectively. Availability as of June 30, 2025, was approximately
$54 million with an outstanding revolver balance of approximately $57 million. Availability as of June 30, 2024, was $44 million with
an outstanding revolver balance of $73 million.
The
maximum borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are determined by a formula based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory,
subject to lender discretion. The facility includes standard representations and warranties, events of default, and financial reporting
requirements, including maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.1 to 1.0 on a trailing twelve-month basis. The facility
also imposes covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, pay dividends, make unpermitted
investments, or materially change its business operations. The facility is secured by a first-priority security interest in the Company’s
and its subsidiaries’ cash, accounts receivable, and related assets.
The
Company was in compliance with its covenants as of June 30, 2025 and 2024. Revolving Credit Facility, net consists of the following

Note
9: Employee Benefits Company Health Plans
During
the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company transitioned its health insurance coverage from a self-funded model to an Individual
Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (“ICHRA”). As a result, the self-insured medical plans (including both PPO and
HDHP options) under the Alliance Health & Benefits Plan (“AHBP”) were terminated. Under the ICHRA model, the Company
reimburses employees and executive officers for individual health insurance premiums, with contribution levels varying based on coverage
tiers.
There
were no changes to the Company’s dental (PPO and HMO), vision, life insurance, or short-term disability plans. The Company’s
dental HMO plan remains self-insured, with exposure limited to a maximum per individual procedure based on a published fee schedule.
The dental PPO plan is fully insured. The Company contributes various percentages toward premium costs across benefit offerings, based
on coverage levels and Board-approved schedules. The vision, life insurance, and short- and long-term disability plans are fully insured
and Company-sponsored, with premiums paid by both the employer and employees in accordance with Board-approved contribution structures.
As
of June 30, 2025, the Company had no remaining liability related to the terminated self-insured medical plans, as the previously accrued
estimated run-out exposure was fully settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. At June 30, 2024, the accrued estimated run-out
exposure for the medical and dental plans totaled approximately $332,000 and was included in accrued expenses on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet. Effective in fiscal 2025, the Company implemented an Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement
(“ICHRA”) plan, which eliminates the Company’s exposure to self-insured medical and dental claims; therefore, no similar
liabilities are expected under the current plan structure.
401(k)
Plan
The
Company has the Alliance Entertainment 401(k) Plan (the Plan) covering all eligible employees of the Company. All employees over the
age of 18 are eligible to participate in the Plan at the beginning of the month following date of hire. The Plan has automatic deferral
at the beginning of the month following the date of hire. Employees are automatically enrolled in the Plan with a 3% contribution; however,
they have the option to increase/decrease their deferrals or opt out of the Plan at any time. The Company currently offers a match contribution
of $0.50 of every dollar up to 4% of contribution percentage. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, and 2024 the company’s
matching expense was approximately $588,000 and $620,000, respectively. The Company conducts a retirement plan review on an annual basis.
Note
10: Segment Information
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,
which requires enhanced disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments, including significant segment expense categories
and expanded interim reporting requirements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2025.
Management performed an assessment of the Company’s operating segments
in accordance with ASC 280-10-50-1 through 50-9. Based on this evaluation, the Company determined that it operates as a single operating
segment, which is also its sole reportable segment. Segment revenue is derived from the sale of distribution of pre-recorded music, video
movies, video games and related accessories, and merchandising. This conclusion is consistent with prior periods.

Note
11: Income Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements
or tax returns as well as tax credits carry forward. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected
future events other than enactments of changes in the tax laws or rates. Valuation allowances are established as necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to an amount more likely than not to be realized.
F-22
The
Company’s policy on income statement classification of interest and penalties related to income tax obligations is to include such
items as part of total interest expense and other expense, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, and 2024, the Company did not have any
material uncertain tax positions and thus has not recognized any interest or penalties in these consolidated financial statements. The
Federal income tax return remains open for examination by the U.S. tax authorities for all years subsequent to 2020.
The
components of the provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the fiscal year-ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 are as

As of June 30, 2025,
2024 and 2023, The Company had recorded no unrecognized tax benefits and, therefore, no accrued interest or penalties for unrecognized
tax positions. In addition, The Company is under examination by the Florida tax authorities. These proceedings may lead to adjustments
or proposed adjustments to their taxes or provisions for uncertain tax provisions. The Company believes that it would prevail under such
examination and, accordingly, has not recorded a provision for uncertain tax positions.
The Company evaluates deferred tax assets each
period for recoverability. The Company records a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the threshold of “more likely than
not” to be realized in the future. To make that determination, the Company evaluates the likelihood of realization based on the
weight of all positive and negative evidence available. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, The Company has not recorded a valuation allowance.
The Company will reevaluate this determination
quarterly and record a tax expense if and when future evidence requires a valuation allowance.
As
of June 30, 2025, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of $14.7 million and state NOLs of $19.3
million. Of these carryforwards, approximately $10.3 million will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2043. The remaining
carryforwards have no expiration.
The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes restrictions
on the utilization of net operating losses and certain credits in the event of an “ownership change” of a corporation. Accordingly,
a company’s ability to use net operating losses and certain credits may be limited as prescribed under.
Note
12: Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
The
Company enters into various agreements with suppliers for the products it distributes. The Company had no long-term purchase commitments
or arrangements with its suppliers as of June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2024.
Litigation,
Claims and Assessments
We
are exposed to claims and litigations of varying degrees arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve
these matters. When a loss is probable, we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. When no point of
loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and, if material, disclose the estimated
range of loss. We do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies but do disclose a range of reasonably possible
losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range. If we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, we
explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.
We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities.
We do not believe that any of these identified claims or litigation will be material to our results of operations, cash flows, or financial
condition.
F-24
On August 8, 2024, a class action complaint, Feller v. Alliance Entertainment,
LLC and DirectToU, LLC, was filed under the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”). The complaint alleges that the Company
violated the VPPA by disclosing users’ personally identifiable information, as well as information regarding videos they viewed
on the Company’s website, to Facebook through the use of Facebook Pixel. The Company is evaluating the claims and intends to defend
against the allegations vigorously. At this time, the potential outcome or range of financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated.
On
June 6, 2024, Office Create Corporation filed a complaint against COKeM International Ltd. (“COKeM”) in the United States
District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging contributory trademark infringement, contributory false designation of origin and
unjust enrichment relating to COKeM’s [alleged] distribution of a specific video game, Cooking Mama: Cookstar. Office Create Corporation
is
seeking damages of no less than $20,913,200, plus interest of 9% accruing from October 3, 2022. On August 29, 2024, COKeM filed a response
denying all allegations. COKeM intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. On September 12, 2024, COKeM filed a Third-Party Complaint against
Planet Entertainment LLC and Steven Grossman asserting claims for indemnification and contribution. Mediation has been postponed. Office Create Corporation
has filed an amended complaint impleading the former owner, chairman, CFO and SVP of Sales for COKeM seeking willful trademark infringement
claims and civil conspiracy. Alliance filed an amended Answer insofar as any new claims pertain to COKeM directly on March 12, 2025.
The Amended Complaint is now seeking damages in excess of $35MM. The court did schedule a settlement conference for August 11, 2025
but Office Create Corporation cancelled it with no new date scheduled. COKeM has offered a settlement amount of $330,000 which has been rejected by Office Create Corporation. COKeM believes that Office Create Corporation is relying on case law that has been overturned and precedent that is not-binding in the
8th Circuit. COKeM has some insurance coverage for this claim with CNA but the policy is capped at $2.5 million for all claims and also
has to be shared with the VPPA class action claim(s) discussed below.

Southern District of Florida, Case No. 0:24-cv-61444; and Vivek Shah v. DirectToU, LLC, JAMS Arbitration, No. 5220006749.- On or
about September 12, 2024, Jonathan Hoang To, who allegedly used the website www.deepdiscount.com; Douglas Feller and Jeffry Haise,
who allegedly used the website www.ccvideo.com; Joseph Mull and Vivek Shah, who allegedly used the website www.moviesunlimited.com.
The lawsuits also put at issue any other website owned or operated by Alliance Entertainment, LLC (“Alliance”) or one of
its corporate affiliates, including the websites www.ccmusic.com and wowhd.co.uk. The lawsuits bring claims against DirectToU, LLC
(“DirectToU”) and/or Alliance, alleging a violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”) related to
the alleged collection of, and alleged disclosure to Meta and other third parties, including data brokers, of alleged private
information and user data regarding a user’s account information and video viewing/purchasing history from the respective
Websites. Plaintiff Hoang To also alleges violations of California’s state VPPA equivalent, as well as violations of
California’s Unfair Competition Law. DirectToU and Alliance dispute the allegations and will defend the lawsuits vigorously.
The parties in the Hoang To matter have reached a settlement with respect to all potential class members. The settlement agreement
has been submitted to the court for approval, slated for December 15, 2024. An approved settlement would cover the class members
covered by the Feller matter, rendering such litigation moot. A motion to stay the Feller matter pending court approval of the
settlement in Hoang To has been filed and granted. Counsel for the Feller parties filed a motion to intervene and stay the
settlement in Hoang, which motions were rejected. The parties await final settlement approval. The settlement was rejected and the
court has mandated the parties initiate discovery with respect to third-party data collection. The Alliance parties have filed a
reply memorandum in support of its motion to compel arbitration on April 28, 2025. The parties reached a settlement on June 12,
2025, whereby COKeM will pay to the class a settlement amount of $1.577MM
and COKeM’s insurance carrier CNA has approved to cover their part of the settlement amount. COKeM will have an estimated
receivable of $1.377M.
The company had accrued for the liability and the receivables from CNA on the balance sheet for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.
The settlement approval before the court is pending and is expected to be ruled on in late October/early November 2025.
McConigle v. Alliance/DirectToU,
LLC: On
December 29, 2024, McConigle filed a class action lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Florida (Case No. 0:24-cv-62443-DSL), alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227
(“TCPA”). On August 8, 2025, subsequent to year-end, the parties entered into a settlement agreement for $70,000.
The Company did not record an accrual for this matter as of June 30, 2025, as the amount was not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect any further material impact from this matter.
Balabbo v Abysse America, Inc., Target Corporation, DirectToU, LLC (Prop 65): On or about December 11, 2024, DirectToU received a tender of defense from Target Corporation citing a possible violation of California Proposition 65 for a product sold by DirectToU allegedly containing lead. The product in question was supplied to Alliance by Abysse America. Alliance/DTU have tendered defense to Abysse. Abysse has engaged counsel to respond to the Prop 65 Violation Notice. At this time, Alliance/DTU have discontinued the product, but have documentation supplied by Abysse showing that the product was properly tested and was within allowable thresholds for lead and other substances.
Algomus v. Alliance: Alliance received a cease and desist notice from Algomus on July 24, 2025, alleging that Alliance
breached a non-solicitation provision of a Master Services Agreement between the parties when Alliance agreed to become the Category Advisor
for Walmart. Alliance responded to the letter on August 8, 2025, asserting that Algomus’s position lacks merit. Alliance had been
conducting business with Walmart prior to the Master Services Agreement, and Algomus and Walmart’s relationship is not governed
by the language of the non-solicitation provision.
On June 9, 2025, Sparkle Pop, LLC v. Alliance Entertainment Holding Corporation and Alliance Entertainment. LLC (U.S. Bankruptcy Court for MD-In Re Diamond Comic Distributors): Sparkle Pop has sued the Alliance entities in bankruptcy court alleging theft of trade secrets and tortious interference with contracts arising out of Alliance’s successful bid and subsequent termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement in the DCD bankruptcy matter.

Alliance will file a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint shortly.

Note
14: Leases
The
Company leases offices, warehouses, computer equipment, and vehicles. Certain leases include options to renew, which may extend the lease
term from 1 one to 13 years. The decision to exercise renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion and is included
in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.
Leasehold
improvements and assets are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term unless the lease includes a purchase
option or title transfer that is reasonably certain to occur.
Our
lease agreements do not include material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Lease payments generally include fixed payments,
with some leases requiring variable payments. These variable payments typically cover the Company’s proportionate share of property
taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance and are recognized as incurred rather than being included in the lease liability.
On
the balance sheet, operating leases are reflected in “Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets, Net,” “Current Portion
of Operating Lease Obligations,” and “Operating Lease Obligations, Non-Current.” Finance leases are included under
“Property & Equipment, Net,” “Current Portion of Finance Lease Obligations,” and “Finance Lease Obligations, Non-Current.
On
June 1, 2024, the Company executed a modification to one of its existing lease agreements to extend the lease term for an additional
seventy-four months. As a result of this modification, the Company recognized an additional $21.9 million to its right-of-use (ROU) asset.
The
extended lease term will result in continued amortization of the ROU asset over the remaining lease period, with the associated lease
liabilities being remeasured in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. The Company will continue to amortize the ROU asset in line with
the revised lease terms and conditions, reflecting the financial impact of the extension in future periods.

15: Merger
As
disclosed in Note 1, on February 10, 2023, the Company completed the Merger with Alliance and a Merger Sub, resulting in the Company
becoming a publicly traded company. While Alliance was the legal acquirer in the Merger, for financial accounting and reporting purposes
under U.S. GAAP, Legacy Alliance was the accounting acquirer, and the Merger was accounted for as a “reverse recapitalization.”
A reverse recapitalization (i.e., a capital transaction involving the exchange of stock by Alliance for Legacy Alliance’s stock)
does not result in a new basis of accounting, and the consolidated financial statements of the combined entity represent the continuation
of the consolidated financial statements of Legacy Alliance. Accordingly, the consolidated assets, liabilities, and results of operations
of Legacy Alliance became the historical consolidated financial statements of the combined company, and Alliance’s assets, liabilities
and results of operations were consolidated with Legacy Alliance beginning on the acquisition date. Operations prior to the Merger are
presented as those of Legacy Alliance in future reports. The net assets of Alliance were recognized at historical cost (which was consistent
with carrying value), with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.
F-27
At
the closing of the Merger, each of the then issued and outstanding shares of Alliance common stock were cancelled and automatically converted
into the right to receive the number of shares of Alliance common stock equal to the exchange ratio (determined in accordance with the
Business Combination Agreement). The Company’s 900 shares of previously outstanding common stock were exchanged for 47,500,000
shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, the treasury stock was cancelled. This change in equity structure has been retroactively
reflected in the financial statements for all periods presented.
The
following table summarizes the shares of Class A outstanding following consummation of the Merger:
Schedule
of Consummation of Merger
Alliance Public Shares
167,170
Alliance Sponsor Shares
1,500,000
Legacy Alliance Shares
47,500,000
Total Shares of Common Stock Outstanding after Merger
49,167,170
Up
to 60 million additional Class E shares may be issued to the Legacy Alliance shareholders at no cost based on future performance of the
company’s stock price, and 9.9 million warrants (Class A) that can be exercised for common shares at $11.50 per share (See Note
20). The 60 million Class E shares are set aside in an escrow account as additional consideration contingent on triggering events occurring
within 10 years after the Merger. Upon reaching the following triggering events, the Class E shares will be released from the escrow
account to the three major shareholders, and converted to Class A shares on a 1:1 basis:
●
If
the stock price increases to $20 per share within 5 years, 20 million Class E shares will be released.
●
If
the stock price increases to $30 per share within 7 years, 20 million Class E shares will be released.
●
If
the stock price increases to $50 per share within 10 years, 20 million Class E shares will be released.
Each
share of Class A and Class E common stock has one vote, and the common shares collectively will possess all voting power and will have
the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders.
Since the Class E shares are subject to vesting conditions and meet the contingent exercise and settlement provisions to be considered
indexed to the Company’s stock, they are accounted for as equity instruments, and are reflected as a reduction of retained earnings,
at their fair value on the date of the Merger.
The
Company incurred total transaction costs of approximately $5.0 million, including legal, financial advisory and other professional fees
related to the Merger, which was recorded as an expense as the offering costs exceeded the proceeds received in the Merger.
In
connection with the Merger, the Company’s 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”) became effective.
The 2023 Plan is a comprehensive incentive compensation plan under which the Company can grant equity-based and other incentives
awards to based officers, employees and directors of, and consultants and advisers to, Alliance and its subsidiaries. The Company
has reserved a total of 600,000
shares of common stock for issuance as or under awards to be made under the 2023 Plan. To the extent that an award lapses, expires,
is canceled, is terminated unexercised or ceases to be exercisable for any reason, or the rights of its holder terminate, any common
stock subject to such award shall again be available for the grant of a new award. The 2023 Plan shall continue in effect, unless
sooner terminated, until the tenth anniversary of the date on which it is adopted by the Board of Directors (except as to awards
outstanding on that date). The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may terminate it at any time with respect to any shares for
which awards have not theretofore been granted, provided certain conditions are met, in accordance with the 2023 Plan. The price at
which a share may be purchased upon exercise of a share option shall be determined by the Plan Committee; provided, however, that
such option price (i) shall not be less than the fair market value of a share on the date such share option is granted, and (ii)
shall be subject to adjustment as provided in the 2023 Plan. As of June 30, 2025, and 2024, 101,300 and 463,800 shares,
respectively, were awarded under the 2023 Plan.

The trademark is determined to have an indefinite useful life and will not be amortized. Instead, it will be tested for impairment annually
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired, in accordance with ASC 350 (Intangibles
– Goodwill and Other).
Inventory was recorded at its estimated fair value on the acquisition date
and is expected to be sold within 18 months. Acquisition-related costs of $59 thousand, consisting of capitalized legal and shipping
fees, included in the value of the intangible asset in accordance with ASC 805 -50-30-1. As a result, the total allocated purchase price,
including capitalized costs, is $7,610 thousand.
Note
17: Reclassification of Private Warrants to Public Warrants
Reclassification
from Liability to Equity
During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, certain shareholders of the Company sold private warrants to third parties who were not deemed “permitted
transferees” under the terms of the Warrant Agreement. In accordance with the Warrant Agreement, upon such a sale, the private
warrants became subject to the same redemption provisions as the Company’s public warrants.
As
a result of this change in terms, the affected warrants, which had previously been accounted for as a liability, were reclassified to
equity. Accordingly, the Company reclassified approximately 769,000 warrants with a carrying value of $0.5 million from warrant liabilities
to Paid-in Capital during fiscal 2025. This reclassification had no impact on the Company’s consolidated statements
of income and comprehensive income or cash flows. Prior period balances were not restated (See Note 20).
Note
18: Stock-Based Compensation:
As
part of the merger with Adara on February 10, 2023, 600,000 shares were authorized for a one-time employee stock plan. The compensation
committee approved 463,800 shares of restricted stock awards to employees on June 15, 2023. The shares fully vest on October 4, 2023.The
company does not have an annual stock-based compensation plan.
In
September 2024, the Company’s Board approved, subject to stockholder approval, an amendment to the 2023 Plan to increase the number
of shares authorized for issuance thereunder by 400,000 shares of Class A common stock, for a total amount reserved under the 2023 Plan
of 1,000,000 shares of Class A common stock. On November 7, 2024, the Company’s stockholder approved the amendment to the 2023
Plan.

Note
19: Impact of Warrant Liabilities on Earnings Per Share (EPS)
Certain
outstanding warrants issued by the Company are classified as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging –
Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity, due to specific terms that require them to be remeasured at fair value at each reporting date.
Changes in fair value are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, which
resulted in fluctuations in the Company’s reported net income and earnings per share (EPS).
During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, and 2024, the Company recorded a loss of $0.9 million, and a loss of $0.04 million, respectively,
related to the fair value measurement of warrant liabilities, primarily due to changes in the market price of our common stock and the
volatility assumptions used in the valuation model.
The
fair value of the warrant liabilities at June 30, 2025, and 2024, was $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and is recorded under
warrant liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Investors
should note that the remeasurement of warrant liabilities is a non-operational, non-cash item. Future changes in fair value will continue
to be recorded in earnings until the warrants are either exercised or expire. Additional details on the fair value assumptions and measurement
techniques are provided in Note 21 – Fair Value.
Note
20: Warrants
As
a result of the Merger, at June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were 5,750,000 Public Warrants , 4,120,000 Private Placement Warrants and 50,090
Representatives Warrants issued and outstanding, each exercisable for one share of Class A Common Stock with an exercise price of $11.50
(the “Warrants”).
The
Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant. It will have no obligation
to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the shares of Class
A common stock underlying the Warrants is then effective. A prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying
its obligations with respect to registration. Additionally, no warrant will be exercisable, and the Company will not be obligated to
issue shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A common stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been
registered, qualified, or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the Warrants.
The
Company filed with the SEC on April 11, 2023, its registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise
of the Warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares
of Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. The registration, as amended,
became effective June 29, 2023.
Public
Warrants:
The
Public Warrants qualify for the derivative scope exception under ASC 815 and are therefore classified as equity on the consolidated balance
sheets. They may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. The Public Warrants are currently exercisable at $11.50 per share and
will expire five years after the completion of the Merger or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem for cash
the outstanding Public Warrants:
●
in
whole and not in part.
●
at
a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant.
●
upon
not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption after the warrants become exercisable to each warrant holder; and
●
if,
and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits,
stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations, and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing
once the Public Warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the
warrant holders. If and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right.
F-30
Even
if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.
If
the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the
Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares
of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event
of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger, or consolidation. However, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted
for issuances of Class A common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to
net cash settle the Public Warrants.
Private
Placement Warrants:
The
Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering but are classified
as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as they are not considered indexed to the company’s own stock. Additionally, the
Private Placement Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and are non-redeemable, so long as they are held by the initial purchasers
or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted
transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the
Public Warrants as described above.
Representative
Warrants
The
Company issued Representative Warrants, for minimal consideration to ThinkEquity, a division of Fordham Financial Management, Inc. (and/or
its designees), in a private placement simultaneously with the closing of Alliance’s initial public offering, which are also classified
as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Representative Warrants are identical to the Private Warrants except that so long
as the Representative Warrants are held by ThinkEquity (and/or its designees) or its permitted transferees, the Representative Warrants
(i) will not be redeemable by the Company, (ii) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis, (iii) are entitled to registration
rights and (iv) are not exercisable more than five years from the effective date of the Merger.
Note
21: Fair Value
The
Company complies with the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, for its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability
category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis.
The
Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the
extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. The company categorizes each of its fair value measurements
in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
As
of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company has classified the Private Placement Warrants and the Representative Warrants as Level 3 fair
value measurements. Management evaluates a variety of inputs and then estimates fair value based on those inputs. As discussed below,
the Company utilized the Black Scholes Model in valuing the Private Placement Warrants and Representative Warrants.
The
estimated fair value of cash, trade receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities are based on Level
1 inputs as the fair values approximate carrying amounts as of June 30, 2025, and 2024, based on the short-term nature and maturity of
these instruments.
The
estimated fair values of subordinated shareholder debt and the credit facility is based on Level 2 inputs, which consist of interest
rates that are currently available to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. As of June 30, 2025,
and 2024 the estimated fair value of the Company’s short and long-term debt approximates it carrying value due to market interest
rates charged on such debt or their short-term maturities.
F-31
The
Company recomputes the fair value of the Private and the Representative Warrants at the issuance date and the end of each quarterly reporting
period. Such value computation includes subjective input assumptions that are consistently applied each period. If the Company were to
alter its assumptions or the numbers input based on such assumptions, the resulting fair value could be materially different.
The
Company utilized the following assumptions to estimate fair value of the Private Warrants and Representative Warrants as of:

The
significant assumptions using the Lattice model approach for valuation of the Private Placement Warrants and Representative Warrants
were determined in the following manner:
(i)
Risk-free
interest rate: the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate with a term matching the time to expiration.
(ii)
Expected
term: the expected term is estimated to be equivalent to the remaining contractual term.
(iii)
Expected
volatility: expected stock volatility is based on daily observations of the Company’s historical stock value and implied by
market price of the Public Warrants, adjusted by guideline public company volatility.
(iv)
Expected
dividend yield: expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s anticipated dividend payments. As the Company has never issued
dividends, the expected dividend yield is 0%, and this assumption will be continued in future calculations unless the Company changes
its dividend policy.
