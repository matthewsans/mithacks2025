CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K” or “Annual Report”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning
of the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements in this Annual Report, other than statements of historical facts,
including, without limitation, statements regarding our strategy, future operations, future operating expenses, future financial position,
future revenue, projected costs, prospects, plans, intentions, expectations, goals and objectives may be forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements in this Annual Report do not constitute guarantees of future performance, and actual results could differ
materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements
by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “contemplate,” “estimate,”
“project,” “forecast,” “would,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “could,”
“can,” “potential,” “possible,” “proposed,” “plan,” “develop,”
“opportunity,” “intend,” “initiative,” “target,” “maintain,” “continue,”
“strive,” “progress,” “aim,” or the negative of these terms or other comparable expressions.
Factors,
among others, that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking
statement include:
●
the
ability to raise additional capital and continue as a going concern;
●
the
accuracy of our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing;
●
the
scope of protection we are able to establish and maintain for our intellectual property rights covering our products and technology;
●
the
ability to compete in our industry, including against competitors that have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing
resources than we do;
●
the
ability to obtain and maintain government or regulatory certification in the countries and regions we sell products in;
●
the
ability to maintain relations with our key distributors;
●
the
impact of global economic and political developments on our business, including rising inflation and interest rates, capital market
disruptions, bank failures, government shutdowns, economic sanctions and economic slowdowns or recessions that may result from such
developments which could harm our research and development efforts as well as the value of our common stock and our ability to access
capital markets;
●
the
implementation of our business model and strategic plans for our business, products, and technology;
●
the
risks related to third parties asserting intellectual property infringement claims against us;
●
the
impact of numerous laws and regulations that apply to us and compliance with these laws and regulations, as they currently exist
or as modified in the future;
●
the
risks related to product recalls, claims of liability, harm to patients or users of our products; and
●
the
ability to retain the   continued service of our key personnel and to identify, hire and retain additional qualified professionals.
Additional
factors that might cause actual results and our current expectations and projections to differ materially include, among other things,
those discussed under the section titled “Risk Factors,” as well as those discussed elsewhere in the Annual Report and the
other risks detailed from time-to-time in our reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
or SEC. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. These forward-looking statements
are based on the current beliefs and expectations of our management and speak only as of the date of this Annual Report or, in the case
of documents referred to or incorporated by reference, the date of those documents. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which are subject to significant known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which are in some cases, beyond
our control and which could materially affect results. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize,
actual results may differ materially from current expectations and projections.
Except
as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements,
no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.

OVERVIEW
THE
COMPANY
We
are a global biomedical technology company that develops, patents, manufactures and markets advanced diagnostic and therapeutic products.
Our diagnostic test kits are used to analyze blood, urine, nasal, or fecal material from patients in the diagnosis of various diseases,
food intolerances, and other medical complications. They can also be used to measure or detect the presence and levels of specific bacteria,
hormones, antibodies, antigens and other substances, which may exist in the human body in extremely small concentrations. Our products
are designed to enhance the health and well-being of people, while reducing total healthcare cost.
Our
extensive range of medical diagnostic products is sold worldwide, primarily in two markets: clinical laboratories and point-of-care
settings. Most of our products are Conformite Europeenne (“CE”) marked and/or registered with regulatory agencies in various
countries for diagnostic use, with several also cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for sale in the
United States.
TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCEMENTS AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Technological
advances in medical diagnostics have enabled diagnostic tests to be performed not only in clinical laboratories but also at home and
at the point-of-care in physicians’ offices. One of our key objectives has been to develop and market rapid diagnostic tests that
are accurate, utilize easily obtained patient specimens, and are simple to perform without the need for complex instrumentation. Our
home use (over-the-counter) and professional use (physicians’ office, clinics, etc.) rapid diagnostic test products help manage
existing medical conditions and may save lives through early detection and diagnosis of specific diseases. Traditionally, such tests
required the expertise of medical technologists and sophisticated equipment, with results often not available for days. We believe our
rapid point-of-care tests, when properly used, can be as accurate as laboratory tests. Our products require limited to no instrumentation,
deliver reliable results in minutes, and can be performed with confidence at home or in a physician’s office.
RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT
We
invest resources in the research and development of new products designed to diagnose and, in some cases, treat several major medical
diseases. These products are either internally developed or licensed from others. Our experienced and highly trained technical personnel,
including Ph.D. holders and other scientists, are dedicated to developing new products and managing technology transfer activities. Our
technical staff, many of whom, have extensive experience from previous employment at large diagnostic manufacturing companies, bring
a wealth of industry knowledge. Additionally, we rely on our Scientific Advisory Board, comprised of leading medical doctors and clinicians,
to guide our clinical studies and product development efforts.
For
the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, consolidated research and development expenses totaled approximately $1,023,000 and $1,491,000,
respectively. The decrease reflects our transition from intensive product development to the commercialization phase of inFoods®
IBS and hp+detect™, as well as our broader efforts to manage costs and preserve cash.
Beyond
IBS, we are pursuing additional applications for the inFoods® technology for other disease states, including Functional Dyspepsia,
Crohn’s Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (“GERD”), Migraine Headaches, Depression, and
Osteoarthritis. We have filed patents globally to protect the use of inFoods® diagnostic technology for these indications, with patents
issued in the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions, and others in review or prosecution.
Our
research and development efforts have also led to the FDA 510(k) clearance of hp+detect™, a proprietary diagnostic test for detecting
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and monitoring treatment. H. pylori is a leading cause of peptic ulcers and a significant risk factor
for gastric cancer. While commercialization activities for hp+detect™ are at an early stage, we continue to position the product
as a reliable diagnostic option for laboratories and physicians.
KEY
PRODUCT LAUNCHES
A
key outcome from our research and development efforts is our patented diagnostic-guided therapy (“DGT”) product, developed
on the inFoods® technology platform. This innovative technology is designed to aid in the management of gastrointestinal conditions
such as irritable bowel syndrome (“IBS”) and other inflammatory diseases. The DGT product targets chronic inflammatory illnesses
that are widespread and prevalent in large markets. We have launched inFoods® IBS product, which leverages this pateneted technology.
The inFoods® IBS product utilizes a simple blood test to identify patient-specific foods that, when eliminated from the diet, may
help reduce IBS symptoms such as pain, bloating, diarrhea, cramping, and constipation. Unlike broad and difficult to manage dietary restrictions,
the inFoods® IBS product pinpoints a patient’s heightened immunoreactivity to specific foods known to frequently trigger IBS
symptoms. By removing the foods identified as problematic, patients can achieve relief from IBS symptoms.
We
have introduced our inFoods® product to gastroenterology (“GI”) physician groups in multiple states and regions,
including collaboration with one of the largest GI groups in the U.S. The initial phase was focused on gathering real world
feedback, optimizing physician engagement, and validating operational processes. GI physician feedback has been generally positive,
and we are continuing to expand our presence in the GI segment while exploring opportunities to bring the inFoods® technology to
other medical specialties. The outcome of our clinical study was published in the June 2025 issue of Gastroenteroloy. We are also
assessing distribution, partnership, and licensing opportunities with large U.S. distributors to support broader
availability and sale/marketing. We are actively pursuing insurance reimbursement for the InFoods IBS product in conjunction with
our CLIA laboratory partner.
1
As
we continue pursue commercial opportunities in both U.S. and international markets, we remain attentive to evolving global economic conditions,
including uncertainties related to international trade policies, tariffs, and supply chain dynamics. Although these factors have not
had a material impact on our operations to date, future changes in trade regulations, tariff structures, or logistical constraints could
influence the cost, availability, or timing of materials and components used in our manufacturing processes. We continue to monitor these
developments closely and are actively implementing contingency plans, including alternative sourcing strategies and supplier diversification,
to support supply chain continuity, maintain operational efficiency, and help mitigate potential future impacts. We are also focusing
on alternative manufacturing and shipping strategies of our products through our European subsidiary (BioEurope), and our Mexican subsidiary
(BioMexico), to mitigate some of the risk these policies may have on our revenues and operations.
In
addition, in December 2023 we received FDA clearance for hp+detect™, a diagnostic test designed to detect Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. H. pylori is a prevalent infection, affecting approximately 35% of the U.S. population
and 45% of the population in Europe’s largest countries. This bacterium is recognized as the strongest known risk factor for gastric
cancer, which remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. The hp+detect™ test is marketed directly to
laboratories and is intended to provide physicians and medical centers with a reliable tool for diagnosing H. pylori infections and monitoring
treatment effectiveness. We are currently  in
discussions with large end-customer laboratories for our hp+detect™ to position it for commercial adoption.
STRATEGIC
INITIATIVES AND COST MANAGEMENT
As
part of our ongoing commitment to operational efficiency and disciplined capital management, we have taken proactive steps to optimize
our cost structure and extend our cash runway. These actions, which include a workforce reduction of approximately 15% during this fiscal
year, which incurred costs such as severance, impacting typical cost trends and margins. Additionally, we raised $2,015,000 in net proceeds
from the ATM offering filed in May 2024  ,
providing additional liquidity to support our operations. We are actively exploring strategic opportunities to enhance and create shareholder
value.

antigen, filling components into vials, packaging and labeling. We continually engage in quality control procedures to assure the consistency
and quality of our products and to comply with applicable FDA and international regulations.
2
Our
manufacturing operations and facilities are regulated by the FDA Current Good Manufacturing Practices for medical devices. We have an
internal quality department that monitors and evaluates product quality and output. We also have an internal Quality Systems department
whose goal is to ensure that our operating procedures are in compliance with current FDA, CE Mark and International Organization for
Standardization (“ISO”) regulations. We either produce our own antibodies and antigens or purchase these materials from qualified
vendors. We have alternate, approved sources for most critical raw materials and are working to procure alternate sources for the few
that we do not have.
MARKETS
AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION
Biomerica
has approximately 76 current customers for its diagnostic business, of which approximately 34 are foreign distributors, 4 are domestic
distributors and the balance are primarily domestic hospital and clinical laboratories, medical research institutions, medical schools,
pharmaceutical companies, chain drugstores, wholesalers, physicians’ offices, and e-commerce customers.
We
employ a director of sales and marketing for Europe and South America who is headquartered in Germany. She has over 20 years of experience
selling and marketing diagnostic and life science products across multiple diagnostics technologies and disciplines. She possesses broad
international business experience, with communication skills in German, English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese, and scientific and
technical understanding of gastrointestinal diagnostic products. She also has strong relationships with key strategic entities in Europe,
Eastern Europe, Latin America, Canada, and the United States and we expect that she will continue to help us
add new distributors
for existing products and add new product-lines for future distribution by us.
We
rely on
distributors, advertising in medical and trade journals, exhibitions at trade shows, direct mailings,
and an internal sales staff to market our diagnostic products. We target two main markets: (a) clinical laboratories and (b) point-of-care
testing (physicians’ offices and over-the-counter drug stores).
Our
net sales were approximately $5,311,000 for fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, compared to $5,415,000 for fiscal year ended May 31,
2024. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025, and 2024, the Company had one distributor each year that accounted for 31%
and 33% of our net sales, respectively.
3
Total
gross receivables were approximately $757,000 and $966,000 as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. As of those dates, four distributors
accounted for approximately 69% and 64% of gross accounts receivable, respectively. Of the 69% concentration as of May 31, 2025, 27%
was attributable to a distributor located in North America.
BACKLOG
As
of May 31, 2025, and 2024, Biomerica’s backlog of unshipped orders was approximately $1,324,000 and $755,000, respectively. As
of May 31, 2025, the majority of this backlog consisted of orders intended for shipment to Asia.
RAW
MATERIALS
Biomerica
utilizes a range of principal raw materials including chemicals, serums, reagents, and packaging supplies. The majority of these materials
are sourced from multiple suppliers, ensuring we are not reliant on any single source. However, for certain critical materials such as
antibodies, where suppliers are limited, there exists a risk of potential supply challenges or increased costs in the future.
Our
inventory includes antibodies, antigens, bottles, boxes, chemicals, and reagents essential for manufacturing our test kits, along with
products in various stages of completion.
For
the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, purchases from one vendor accounted for approximately 12% of our total raw material procurement,
primarily related to commodity plastic products. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, purchases from one vendor accounted for approximately
16% of our total raw material procurement, also primarily related to commodity plastic products.
COMPETITION
We
offer several proprietary products with notable competitive advantages, including our EZ Detect colon disease home test, Aware Breast
Self-Exam product, inFoods® IBS product, and hp+detect™ for H. pylori detection. These products stand
out due to their unique features and benefits compared to competing tests in the market.
Our
competitors vary greatly in size. Many are divisions or subsidiaries of well-established medical and pharmaceutical companies which are
much larger than Biomerica and expend substantially greater amounts than we do for research and development, manufacturing, advertising,
and marketing.
The
competitive landscape for diagnostic products is shaped by several factors, including product uniqueness, technology, quality, performance,
pricing, and service. Our competitive edge is grounded in the distinctiveness of our offerings, the high quality of our products, and
their rapid test results. Our strong patent portfolio further bolsters our market position despite our limited marketing capabilities.
GOVERNMENT
REGULATION OF OUR DIAGNOSTIC BUSINESS
Our
primary business consists of selling products that are generally legally defined as medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices.
As a result, we are a medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices manufacturer, and as such, we are subject to the regulations
issued and enforced by of numerous governmental entities. These agencies include the FDA, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Trade
Commission, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), and Consumer Product
Safety Commission, as well as certain European Government agencies. Our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states
and localities in which our products are sold. These regulations govern the introduction of new in vitro diagnostic medical devices and
other medical devices, the observance of certain standards with respect to the manufacture and labeling of medical devices, the maintenance
of certain records, the reporting of potential product problems, and other related matters.
The
Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act of 1938 (the “FDCA”) regulates medical devices in the United States by classifying them into
one of three classes based on the extent of regulation believed necessary to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those
devices for which safety and effectiveness can reasonably be assured through general controls, such as device listing, adequate labeling,
and adherence to the Quality Management System Regulation (“QMSR”) as well as Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”),
labeling and other regulatory requirements. Some Class I medical devices are exempt from the requirement of Pre-Market Notification or
clearance. Class II devices are those devices for which safety and effectiveness can reasonably be ensured through using special controls,
such as performance standards, post-market surveillance and patient registries, as well as adherence to the general controls’ provisions
applicable to Class I devices. Class III devices are devices that generally must receive clearance by the FDA pursuant to a pre-market
approval prior to marketing to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Generally, Class III devices are limited to life-sustaining, life-supporting,
or implantable devices. However, this classification can also apply to novel technology or new intended uses or applications for existing
devices. Our products are primarily either Class I or Class II medical devices.
4
Pursuant
to FDA requirements, we have registered our manufacturing facility with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and listed the medical
devices we manufacture. We are also subject to inspection on a routine basis for compliance with FDA regulations. This includes the Quality
System Regulation (“QSR”), which requires that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner
with respect to issues such as design controls, manufacturing, testing, and validation activities. Further, we are required to comply
with other FDA requirements with respect to labeling and MDR regulations which requires that we provide information to the FDA on deaths
or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of our products, as well as any product malfunctions that are likely
to cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. We believe that we are currently in material compliance
with all relevant QSR and MDR requirements.
In
addition, our facility is required to have a California Medical Device Manufacturing License. The license is not transferable and must
be renewed biannually. Our current license is valid until November 19, 2026. Through compliance with FDA and California regulations,
we can market some of our medical devices throughout the United States. International sales of medical devices are also subject to the
regulatory requirements of each country where the product is sold. In Europe, the directives of the European Union (“EU”)
require that a device has a CE Mark in order to be sold in EU countries. We comply with In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive
(“IVDD”) 98/79/EC, Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 MDR and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/746)
(“IVDR”). We also comply with ISO 13485:2016 Medical Devices Quality Management Systems – Requirements for Regulatory
Purposes and EN ISO 14971:2019.
At
present, outside of the EU, the international regulatory review process varies from country to country. We work with our distributors
and sales representatives in the foreign countries in which we market our products to ensure that we comply with the regulatory laws
of those countries. We believe that our international sales to date have been in compliance with the laws of all foreign countries in
which we have made sales. Exports of most medical devices are also subject to certain FDA regulatory controls.
The
designing, development, manufacturing, marketing, post-market surveillance, distribution, advertising, and labeling of our immunoassay
in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) medical device products are subject to regulation in the United States by the Center for Devices
and Radiological Health of the FDA and state agencies. FDA regulations require that some new products have pre-marketing clearance or
approval by the FDA and require these products to be manufactured in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice
(“cGMP”) regulations, to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims
and limitations. After a product that is subject to FDA regulation is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including,
for example, the requirement that we comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements, such as the FDA’s medical device reporting
regulations and reporting of corrections and removals. The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and post-market surveillance.
The last FDA-announced inspection was in May 2024 and no observations were noted. We believe that all our products sold in the United
States comply with the FDA and applicable state regulations.
We
are an FDA-regulated and ISO 13485:2016-certified In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices company. Our goal is to provide high quality medical
diagnostic products that generally meet or exceed customer requirements and comply with all applicable regulatory requirements: FDA 21
CFR Part 820 Quality Management System, ISO 13485:2016, Medical Devices Quality Management Systems – Requirements for Regulatory
Purposes, In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC, Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical
Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/746) IVDR, Guidelines related to Medical Devices Directive/Regulation Guidance on CE Marking, among others.
We involve our employees in a continuous improvement process to increase productivity, improve quality and maintain the suitability,
adequacy, and effectiveness of our quality management system.
The
EU In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (“IVDR”EU) 2017/746 was effective on May 26, 2022.
Manufacturers need to update their technical documentation and processes to meet the more stringent regulatory requirements of the European
Union. Notified Bodies can begin certifying devices to the new IVDR requirements once they have been designated under IVDR by their Competent
Authority. Our Notified Body is officially designated under the IVDR and listed in the European Commission NANDO database since August
19, 2021. We are working closely with our Notified Body to update our technical documentation to comply with these more stringent IVDR
requirements.

Our
international operations face distinct risks that differ from those encountered in the United States. These risks include economic fluctuations,
regulatory changes, geopolitical instability (such as terrorism and trade disputes), tariffs, embargoes, import/export restrictions,
and potential disruptions in shipping and distribution channels. Such factors can significantly impact our foreign sales and may complicate
our ability to collect accounts receivable in international markets during economic downturns.
Each
country has its own licensing requirements for diagnostic products, which can differ considerably from U.S. regulations and may change
unexpectedly. Currently, our international sales rely on approximately 38 independent distributors across around 30 countries. These
diverse factors contribute to the complexities and uncertainties associated with our international business operations.
INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY
We
consider the protection of our methodologies, designs, product formulations, manufacturing processes, diagnostic procedures, copyrights,
service marks, trademarks, and trade secrets essential for our future success. To safeguard our proprietary rights in products and services,
we utilize copyright, trademark, patent, service mark, and trade secret laws, alongside contractual restrictions. Our efforts include
confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors, as well as nondisclosure agreements with most fulfilment
and strategic partners to restrict access to and disclosure of proprietary information. However, these measures may not entirely prevent
unauthorized use or disclosure of our technology.
6
In
the past, we have licensed and may continue to license certain proprietary rights, such as trademarks, patents, trade secrets, or copyrighted
material, to third parties. While we strive to maintain the quality of our product brands through these license agreements, we cannot
guarantee that licensees will always act in a manner that preserves the value of our proprietary rights or reputation.
LICENSE
OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
On
occasion, we in-licensed both exclusive and non-exclusive rights to intellectual property and patents owned by third parties. These license
agreements typically require royalties and other payments.
We
have a royalty agreement in which we obtained rights to manufacture and market an Adrenocorticotropic Hormone test (“ACTH test”) (used to detect chronic metabolic conditions).
Royalty expenses of approximately $7,000 and $10,000, respectively, are included in cost of sales for this agreement for the fiscal years
ended May 31, 2025 and 2024. Sales of products manufactured under this agreement are not material to total sales for the fiscal years
ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We may license other products or technology in the future as it is deemed necessary or opportunistic
for conducting business.
Some
of the products that we manufacture, sell, or use may be covered by claims in issued patents held by other persons or entities, and as
such, upon notice from such persons or entity we may be required to pay a license fee or may be required to cease all manufacture, sale
or use of such products, which could negatively impact us. While we have not been notified of any such claims by third parties, we cannot
guarantee that such claims will not be made in the future.
BRANDS
AND TRADEMARKS
We
occasionally register our tradenames with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). Of note, we registered
the tradename “InFoods” on December 24, 2016. Our unregistered tradenames are “EZ Detect,” “EZ-H.P.,”
and “EZ-PSA”. A trademark for “Aware” was issued and assigned in 2001, renewed in 2011 and 2021. On January 11,
2020, the USPTO renewed our “FORTEL” trademark for another ten years.
The
laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Effective
copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available in such jurisdictions.
PATENTS
AND INFOODS TECHNOLOGY
We
have filed dozens of international and Patent Corporation Treaty patents (“PCT”) and have multiple provisional and non-provisional
patents currently filed with the USPTO. Substantially 15 of our patents that are pending or registered pertain to the inFoods®
technology platform.
Our
most important family of patent applications pertains to our inFoods® technology platform, which is a method of diagnosing
and treating symptoms of many different inflammatory diseases. Our first product launch using this technology is the inFoods®
IBS product which is designed to diagnose and treat IBS. Using a patient blood sample, a physician or lab can run our test to identify
specific foods (e.g., pork, milk, onions, sugar, chickpeas) that, if eliminated from an IBS patient’s diet, can alleviate or reduce
the individual’s IBS symptoms, including, but not limited to, constipation, diarrhea, bloating, cramping, severe pain, and indigestion.
We have filed many patent applications with the USPTO and with other such similar agencies in other countries outside of the United States
pertaining to this inFoods® technology. These patent applications include claims that address the diagnosis and treatment
of several disease states including IBS, functional dyspepsia, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease,
osteoarthritis, psoriasis, migraine headaches, and depression. The first inFoods® patents filed by us pertained to IBS.
Several of these patents pertaining to the inFoods® IBS technology have been issued and many more are in active review
and prosecution.
In
August 2018, we received our first patent pertaining to the inFoods® technology platform from the Korean Intellectual
Property Office, covering IBS. Since then, we have been granted a total of 15 patents. The USPTO has issued the Company two patents
with broad claims that protect our inFoods® technology in testing and treating patients with IBS. Patents have also
been issued in the countries of Australia, Canada, Japan (two patents), Korea (two patents), Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Singapore,
covering our inFoods® IBS technology. Additional patent applications pertaining to the inFoods® IBS
product are in prosecution and review at the USPTO and with the patent issuance authorities in other countries.
7
We
are also developing and have filed patents with claims that cover products that target other diseases utilizing the inFoods®
technology platform. We have dozens of patents that are issued, in prosecution or review, pertaining to these other diseases, including:
Functional Dyspepsia, Crohn’s disease, Ulcerative Colitis, GERD, Migraine Headaches, Depression, and Osteoarthritis. In addition,
we have a family of patents that cover the use of certain information technology (“IT”) platforms and artificial intelligence/machine
learning (“AI/ML”) tools that could assist patients in identifying and avoiding packaged or processed food that contain specific
foods that they are trying to eliminate from their diet.
In
addition to our inFoods IBS related issued patents, we have also been issued inFoods® technology patents pertaining to
the following diseases in the following jurisdictions:
●
Attention
Deficit Disorder (“ADD”) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”): Australia, European Patent
Office (EP), Unitary Patent Office (UP) for certain EU countries, Mexico
●
Crohn’s
Disease: Mexico, EP, United Kingdom (UK), UP
●
GERD
Disease: Australia, EP, UP, UK
●
Migraine
Disease: Japan, EP
●
Osteoarthritis
Disease: Mexico, Japan
●
Psoriasis
Disease: AU, EP, UK, UP
●
Psychological
depression: US, EP, Japan, Mexico, UK, UP
●
Ulcerative
Colitis: EP, Japan, UK, UP
●
IT
based food monitoring and elimination technology: Japan
We
believe the claims in these issued inFoods® IBS patents and claims in our pending patents that protect the use of the
inFoods® technology to diagnose and treat various other diseases, provide us with broad protections from other companies
making or selling competing products in this highly disruptive new field of medicine.
In
addition to the use of our own patents, we have been granted from third parties the rights to use, manufacture and sell certain products
that are protected by patents or other intellectual property owned by these third parties. In some cases, royalties are paid on the sales
of these products. We anticipate that we will license or purchase the rights to other products or technologies in the future.
We
also engage in contract research and development and contract manufacturing for third party companies. The technologies that relate to
this contract research and development and manufacturing are protected by patents and other intellectual property. In these situations,
this intellectual property is typically licensed to us under a limited license agreement enabling us to perform the services being contracted.
With
the launch of inFoods® IBS, our business model for this product includes the potential out-licensing of the product and
related patents to a large international life sciences or technology company that could commercialize it or support us in its commercialization.
Additionally, we may explore out-licensing opportunities for the patents or intellectual property associated with other products, including
our H. pylori product.
EMPLOYEES
As
of May 31, 2025 and 2024, we employed a total of 54 and 64 employees, respectively, in the United States, Mexico, UK and Germany, of
which 53 and 63 were full-time employees, respectively.
We
engage a range of external experts. including Ph.D.’s, M.D.’s, and other industry specialists, as well as medical institutions,
to support various aspects of our operations. These services include technical support, regulatory guidance, marketing and public relations,
financial advisory, and contract product development and manufacturing. To safeguard the Company, we implement confidentiality agreements,
intellectual property ownership clauses, and indemnification provisions with these external parties. Despite these measures, we cannot
guarantee complete protection against third-party claims or potential intellectual property theft.

The risks and uncertainties summarized above and described below are not intended to be exhaustive and are not the only ones we face.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results could differ materially and adversely from our anticipated results as a result
of a number of factors, including the risks described below.
RISKS
RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS
We
have a history of operating losses.
We
have a history of operating losses, and there is no guarantee that we will achieve profitability in the future. Our ability to generate
net profits and maintain positive cash flows is uncertain. Failure to achieve or sustain profitability could result in a decline in the
value of our common stock and may necessitate seeking additional funding under potentially unfavorable conditions.
Although
our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, our current level of cash and cash equivalents available to us
is not sufficient to meet our operating plans for the next 12 months, raising substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as
a going concern.
Our
financial statements as of May 31, 2025, have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next
twelve months from the date of issuance. However, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that includes
an explanatory paragraph highlighting our operational losses and expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least the next twelve months from the date this report is filed.
Our
ability to continue as a going concern depends on obtaining additional financing, achieving further operating efficiencies, increasing
sales, reducing costs, and ultimately generating profitable operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure the necessary
capital on favorable terms, achieve sufficient revenue growth, or implement adequate cost reductions. Our financial statements do not
reflect any adjustments that might result from the resolution of this uncertainty.
Our
operating results may fluctuate adversely as a result of many factors that are outside our control, which may negatively impact our stock
price.
Our
operating results are subject to fluctuations due to factors outside our control, which may adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and stock price. Key factors include:
●
Regulatory
Clearances: Delays or issues with obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, and other markets.
●
Regulatory
Compliance: Challenges in meeting compliance requirements in various jurisdictions.
●
Competition:
Introduction of superior or lower-priced products by competitors could impact our market share.
●
Reimbursement
Changes: Alterations in reimbursement systems or amounts could affect product usage decisions.
●
Economic
Conditions: Economic downturns, changes in healthcare spending, reduced consumer demand, inflation, and currency fluctuations.
●
Legal
and Regulatory Changes: New or amended laws and regulations affecting our business operations.
●
Market
Penetration: Lower than expected adoption of new or recently introduced products.
●
Distributor
Dynamics: Variability in distributor inventory levels, buying patterns, and overall performance.
●
Government
Mandates: Risks from shelter-in-place orders, lockdowns, or other crisis-related directives.
●
Tariffs:
Potential of order holds or sales delays or reductions due to Tariffs
●
Healthcare
Market Changes: Consolidation in our customer base or shifts in the healthcare market landscape.
9
Fluctuations
in our operating results, for any reason, could cause operating losses as a result of significant fixed expenses.
We
base the scope of our operations and related expenses on our estimates of future revenues. A significant portion of our operating expenses
are fixed, and we may not be able to rapidly adjust our expenses if our revenues fall short of our expectations. Our revenue estimates
for future periods are based, among other factors, on estimated end-user demand for our products. If end-user consumption is less than
estimated, revenues from our distribution partners and other distribution channels would be expected to fall short of expectations, and
because such a significant portion of our costs are fixed, could result in operating losses.
To
remain competitive, we must continue to develop, obtain, and protect our proprietary technology rights; otherwise, we may lose market
share or need to reduce prices as a result of competitors selling technologically superior products that compete with our products, or
selling products at lower prices.
Our
ability to compete successfully in the diagnostic market depends on continued development and introduction of new products, technology,
and the improvement of existing technology. If we cannot continue to improve upon or develop, obtain, and protect our technology, our
operating results could be adversely affected.
To
remain competitive, we must expend considerable resources to research new technologies and products and develop new markets, and there
is no assurance our efforts to develop new technologies, products, or markets will be successful or such technologies, products, or markets
will be commercially viable.
We
devote a significant amount of financial and other resources to researching and developing new technologies, new products, and new markets.
The development, manufacture and sale of diagnostic products require a significant investment of resources. The development of new products
and markets also requires a substantial investment of resources, such as new employees, offices and manufacturing facilities, consultants,
and clinical trials. No assurances can be given that our efforts to develop new technologies or products will be successful, that such
technologies and products will be commercially viable, or our expansion into new markets will be profitable.
There
is also no guarantee that our new products, including our inFoods® IBS product and hp+detect™, will be
well accepted into the marketplace.
Our
operations will be adversely affected if our operating results do not correspondingly increase with our increased expenditures or if
our technology, product, and market development efforts are unsuccessful or delayed. Furthermore, our failure to successfully introduce
new technologies or products and develop new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.
The
Company is required to obtain government or regulatory certification in many countries and the European community to sell its products
in those countries or regions. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to retain its certification in the future. This includes
the possibility and risk that the Company’s products do not meet the new EU IVDR testing and documentation requirements in the
future as described in the above “Research and Development” section of this document.
Significant
government regulation exists in countries in which we conduct business. A large part of the Company’s sales is to distributors
in Europe, China, and other countries, which require us to maintain certain certifications to sell our products. Failure to comply with
current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could cause the loss of these certifications, which could materially
adversely affect the results of the Company. Loss of certifications could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product recalls,
product shortages, or delays in product manufacturing and a decline in sales. Also, evolving EU IVDR requirements may increase compliance
costs and extend certification timelines, which could limit our ability to sell certain IVDD products in the EU.
The
Company maintains a manufacturing plant in Mexico which presents risks to the Company including risks associated with doing business
outside the United States.
We
operate a significant manufacturing facility in Mexico through our subsidiary, Biomerica de Mexico. This international presence introduces
a range of risks, including exposure to local economic and political conditions. Factors such as social unrest, potential terrorism,
export and import restrictions, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could impact our operations. Additionally, there is a risk
of labor shortages, which could affect our manufacturing capabilities. These factors could lead to unforeseen costs and disruptions,
materially impacting our business, financial results, and operational stability.
10
We
use hazardous materials in our research and production that may result in unexpected and substantial claims against us relating to handling,
storage, or disposal.
Our
research and production processes involve the use of hazardous materials, which presents inherent risks. Despite rigorous safety protocols,
the possibility of accidental contamination or injury cannot be entirely eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could face significant
liability for harm or damages, potentially exceeding our financial resources. Compliance with environmental regulations also entails
substantial costs.
If
government authorities introduce new environmental regulations or change the interpretation of existing regulations, our operations could
be further impacted. Such changes may impose additional costs, restrictions, or compliance requirements, which could hinder our research,
development, or production efforts. Noncompliance with these regulations may result in significant fines, penalties, or damages, and
could necessitate costly remediation efforts. Furthermore, severe environmental or safety violations could lead to partial or total shutdowns
of our research and manufacturing facilities, adversely affecting our business. The risk of contamination or injury from hazardous materials
may also expose individuals to potential health hazards, resulting in fines or penalties that might not be covered by insurance, thereby
impacting our financial stability and operational continuity.
We
rely on a limited number of key distributors that account for a substantial majority of our total revenue. The loss of any key distributor
or an unsuccessful effort by us to directly distribute our products could lead to reduced sales.
Our
net sales were approximately $5,311,000 for fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, compared to $5,415,000 for fiscal year eneded May 31,
2024. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company had one distributor each year that accounted for 31% and 33% of
our net sales, respectively.
Total
gross receivables as of May 31, 2025, and 2024 were approximately $757,000 and $966,000, respectively. As of May 31, 2025 and 2024, the
Company had four distributors, respectively, that accounted for a total of 69% and 64% of gross accounts receivable, respectively. Of
the 69% as of May 31, 2025, 27% was owed by a distributor in North America. Any adverse changes in our relationships with key distributors,
or adverse issues related to their financial condition, performance, or purchasing patterns, could have a significant impact on our sales
and overall financial results. The loss of a key distributor, or the failure of our direct distribution efforts, could further exacerbate
these challenges and adversely affect our business.
We
face risks relating to our international sales, including inherent economic, political, and regulatory risks, which could impact our
financial performance, cause interruptions in our current business operations and impede our growth strategy.
We
face risks relating to our international sales, including economic, political, and regulatory challenges, which could impact our financial
performance, disrupt our business operations, and hinder our growth strategy.
A
significant amount of our products are sold internationally, with substantial sales to distributors in Asia and Europe. We rely on distributor
organizations and sales agents to market and sell our products abroad, which exposes us to various foreign risks, including:
●
Compliance
Challenges: We must adhere to diverse and evolving registration requirements, which can be controlled by distributors, complicating
transitions and limiting our ability to benefit from product registrations.
●
Regulatory
Risks: We must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as import/export limitations, the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, and local laws in each market.
●
Tariffs
and Trade Barriers: As we expand into new countries and regions, we face changing tariffs and trade barriers, particularly in China
which accounts for a large percentage of our sales, and where tariff policies are troublesome.
●
Currency
Exchange Fluctuations: Our international sales are subject to currency risks, as changes in the values of foreign currencies relative
to the U.S. dollar can make our products more expensive and negatively impact sales.
●
Payment
and Pricing Challenges: We encounter longer payment cycles, generally lower average selling prices, and greater difficulty in collecting
accounts receivable.
●
Legal
Enforceability: We may lack the ability to enforce receivables collections contracts in foreign legal systems.
●
Intellectual
Property Risks: There is often reduced protection for, and enforcement of, intellectual property rights in foreign markets.
●
Political
and Economic Instability: We are exposed to political and economic instability in regions where we currently sell or plan to expand
our product sales.
●
Tax
Consequences: We face complex and potentially adverse tax implications in different jurisdictions.
●
Product
Diversion: Products sold internationally at lower prices may be diverted back to the United States, affecting our domestic sales.
11
Most
of our international sales are negotiated and paid in U.S. dollars. However, currency risks remain, as fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates can make our products comparatively more expensive. These exchange rate changes, along with general economic conditions in international
markets, could negatively impact our sales. To maintain competitive pricing, we may need to offer discounts or reduce prices, leading
to lower margins on international sales. Continued changes in the values of the Euro, the Mexican peso, and other foreign currencies
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We
also have supply agreements with foreign vendors that involve sharing foreign currency exchange fluctuation risks. We may enter into
similar arrangements in the future.
A
significant portion of our revenues comes from sales to our distribution partner in China. Political tensions between the U.S. and China
could disrupt or reduce our sales in the Chinese market, posing a substantial risk to our business.
Tariffs
and trade dynamics may affect order timing.
In
certain markets, tariff changes and related trade uncertainties contributed to extended lead times and rescheduled shipments, which affected
the timing of revenue recognition for certain international orders.
Our
results of operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected by the financial soundness of our customers, distributors, and
suppliers.
Our
operational results and financial condition are closely linked to the financial health of our customers, distributors, and suppliers.
If any of these parties experience a deterioration in their financial performance or encounter difficulties with scheduled payments or
credit, it could have several adverse effects on our business.
For
instance, if our customers are unable to pay or delay payment on accounts receivable, this would negatively impact our cash flow. Similarly,
if our suppliers face financial challenges, they may restrict credit, impose more stringent payment terms, reduce or cease production
of essential components, or even stop operations entirely. Such disruptions could directly affect our ability to procure necessary materials
and maintain consistent product supply.
Moreover,
reductions in reimbursements or purchase volumes from state and federal government programs, or private payers, could also occur due
to budget constraints or expenditure cuts. These reductions could adversely impact our revenues and cash flow, further straining our
financial performance.
The
combined effect of these potential challenges could significantly influence our operating results and financial stability.
We
extend credit to customers outside the United States which can be difficult to collect.
We
extend credit to many of our customers, including those located outside the United States. Collecting receivables, particularly from
international customers, can be challenging due to difficulties in obtaining reliable credit information and the complexities of enforcing
collections through foreign legal systems. If we are unable to effectively manage and collect on these receivables, especially from international
customers, it could have a detrimental impact on our financial performance and liquidity.
If
we are not able to manage our growth strategy our operating results may be adversely affected.
Our
business strategy contemplates further growth, including scaling up our operational systems and entering new geographical markets, including
those outside the United States. This growth strategy could place additional demands on our limited employee and executive staff, potentially
diverting their focus from core business activities. Furthermore, managing growth may strain our operational, financial, and management
information systems.
Expanding
into new markets or undertaking acquisitions introduces several risks, such as higher costs, unfamiliar market conditions, and integration
challenges. Any difficulties in managing this growth or expanding effectively could adversely affect our operating results and financial
performance. The strain on management resources and potential inefficiencies in our systems could lead to operational and financial setbacks.
The
industry and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive, and intense competition with other providers of diagnostic products
may reduce our sales and margins.
The
diagnostic products industry and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive. Our diagnostic tests face competition from
similar products produced by numerous multinational and regional competitors who are heavily investing in competing technologies. Additionally,
some of our distributors have developed, or may develop, their own products to compete directly with ours.
12
Many
of our competitors have substantial competitive advantages over us, including significantly greater financial, technical, and research
resources. They also possess larger, more established marketing, sales, distribution, and service networks; stronger relationships with
healthcare professionals; and extensive experience in research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, and regulatory approvals.
Furthermore, some competitors offer a broader range of products and enjoy greater brand recognition.
If
our competitors’ products prove to be more effective or capture market share through superior marketing or competitive pricing,
our sales and margins could suffer. This intense competition could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
Additionally,
there has been a noticeable trend towards industry consolidation in recent years, with companies merging to strengthen or maintain their
market positions. This trend is expected to continue as companies strive to adapt to the evolving industry landscape. Competing successfully
in a consolidated industry may become increasingly challenging, and failure to do so could adversely impact our market position and financial
performance.
Intellectual
property risks and third-party claims of infringement, misappropriation of proprietary rights, or other claims against us could adversely
affect our ability to market our products, require us to redesign our products or attempt to seek licenses from third parties, result
in significant costs, and materially adversely affect our operating results.
Companies
in or related to our industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights. There are often intellectual
property risks associated with developing and producing new products and entering new markets, and we may not be able to obtain, at reasonable
cost or upon commercially reasonable terms, if at all, licenses to intellectual property of others that is alleged to be part of such
new or existing products.
We
rely on IP for the current products we sell and for the new products in research, development, and in clinical trials. While the Company
tries to protect its IP with confidentiality agreements and internal policies, we still face risks that our IP will be stolen or otherwise
misappropriated, by parties inside or outside of the United States. Further, we have filed many patents around the world on much of the
research and development done by the Company, and the proposed products to come from this research. The majority of these filed patents
are still under review and have not yet been allowed or issued. We may not be able to attain patent claims that adequately protect the
company from competitors developing similar products or copying our products. Finally, there is a great number of issued patents owned
by others that pertain to the product categories in which we operate. While we do not know of any patents with claims that we are violating
by manufacturing or selling our current products, there is a risk that certain third-party patents will come to our attention that prohibit
us from selling our products or that require us to pay royalty payments. Such third-party claims could have a material negative impact
on the Company. Any of these IP-related risks could cause material damage to future revenues and to the long-term enterprise values of
the Company.
We
have hired and will continue to hire individuals or contractors who have experience in medical diagnostics and these individuals or contractors
may have confidential trade secret or proprietary information of third parties. We cannot assure that these individuals or contractors
will not use this third-party information in connection with performing services for us or otherwise reveal this third-party information
to us. Thus, we could be sued for misappropriation of proprietary information and trade secrets. Such claims are expensive to defend
and could divert our attention and result in substantial damage awards and injunctions that could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, to the extent that individuals or contractors apply technical or
scientific information independently developed by them to our projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such data
and may result in litigation.
The
defense and prosecution of patent and trade secret claims are both costly and time consuming. We or our customers may be sued by other
parties that claim that our products have infringed their patents or misappropriated their proprietary rights or that may seek to invalidate
one or more of our patents. An adverse determination in any of these types of disputes could prevent us from manufacturing or selling
some of our products, limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved with such products may perform for us, increase our
costs, and expose us to significant liability. In addition, the defense of such claims could result in significant costs and divert the
attention of our management and other key employees.
In
addition to the foregoing, we may also be required to indemnify some customers, distributors, and strategic partners under our agreements
with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon, misappropriated,
or misused another person’s proprietary rights. Further, our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such
as contractors, suppliers, or customers. We may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the
intellectual property rights of a third party. Our contractors, suppliers, and licensors may not be required or financially able to indemnify
us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us, or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount,
above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages.
13
Some
of the products that we manufacture, sell, or use may be covered by claims in issued patents held by other persons or entities, and as
such, upon notice from such persons or entity, we may be required to pay a license fee or may be required to cease all manufacture, sale
or use of such products, which could negatively impact our financial results or operations. We cannot guarantee that such claims will
not be made in the future.
We
need to continue to raise additional funds to finance our future capital or operating needs, which could have adverse consequences on
our operations and the interests of our stockholders.
Although
we currently generate revenue, our company is operating at a loss due to significant commercialization of newly developed products and
from a slow launch in revenues from our new products and some investments in research and development and. To sustain and advance our
business strategy, we must continue to raise additional funds to meet our capital and operating needs. This often involves seeking public
or private debt or issuing equity. Raising funds through equity can dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.
The
availability of capital, whether through debt or equity, is subject to fluctuations based on our financial condition and general market
or industry conditions. There may be periods when private capital markets or public debt and equity markets lack liquidity, or when we
are unable to sell our securities at favorable prices. In such scenarios, accessing capital on favorable terms may become challenging.
Failure
to secure adequate funding could force us to delay, reduce, or even eliminate certain development programs or commercialization efforts.
The costs associated with development projects and regulatory approvals can be unpredictable and may exceed our initial estimates. As
our current operations are insufficient to cover these unexpected costs, this could adversely impact our ability to execute our business
strategy and achieve our long-term goals.
Our
business and products are highly regulated by various governmental agencies. Our results of operations would be negatively affected by
failures or delays in the receipt of regulatory approvals or clearances, the loss of previously received approvals, or other changes
to the existing laws and regulations that adversely impact our ability to manufacture and market our products.
The
testing, manufacturing, and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States,
principally the FDA, and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. Our future performance depends on, among other matters,
if, when, and at what cost we will receive regulatory approval for new products, and if we can continue to comply with the many regulatory
requirements that enable us to manufacture and sell medical related products and tests. Regulatory review can be a lengthy, expensive,
and uncertain process, making the timing and costs of clearances and approvals difficult to predict. Meeting all regulatory requirements,
laws and mandates, and maintaining compliance with such in order to manufacture and sell medical products can be difficult and expensive.
Our results of operations would be negatively affected by failures or delays in the receipt of regulatory approvals or clearances, the
loss of previously received approvals or clearances, the placement of limits on the marketing and use of our products, and restrictions
on our ability to manufacture our products.
Changes
in government policy could adversely affect our business and potential profitability.
Changes
in government policy could have a significant impact on our business by increasing the cost of doing business, affecting our ability
to sell our products and negatively impacting our profitability. Such changes could include tariffs, embargos, trade wars, modifications
to existing legislation, such as U.S. tax policy, or entirely new legislation, such as the Affordable Healthcare Act in the United States.
We cannot predict the many ways that healthcare reform in the United States and internationally, and changing trade legislation and policies
could adversely affect our business. It is unclear whether and to what extent, if at all, other anticipated developments, including changes
due to new presidential administration priorities, or changes resulting from healthcare reform, such as a change in the number of people
with health insurance, may impact us.
We
are subject to numerous government regulations in addition to FDA regulations, and compliance with laws, including changed or new laws,
could increase our costs and adversely affect our operations. There is also the risk that our facilities could fail to get the proper
licensing at our next inspection or renewal.
In
addition to FDA and other regulations referred to above, numerous laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing
practices, data privacy, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances
impact our business operations. If these laws or their interpretation change or new laws regulating any of our businesses are adopted,
the costs of compliance with these laws could substantially increase our overall costs. Failure to comply with any laws, including laws
regulating the manufacture and marketing of our products, could result in substantial costs and loss of sales or customers. Because of
the number and extent of the laws and regulations affecting our industry, and the number of governmental agencies whose actions could
affect our operations, it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and impact of future legislation or regulatory developments
relating to our industry and our products. To the extent the costs and procedures associated with meeting new or changing requirements
are substantial, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
14
Our
total revenue could be affected by third-party reimbursement policies and potential cost constraints.
The
end-users of our products are physicians, labs, other healthcare providers and direct consumers. In the United States, healthcare providers
such as hospitals and physicians who purchase diagnostic products generally rely on third-party payers, principally private health insurance
plans, federal Medicare, and state Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure. The growth needed in the sales of
our products would be adversely impacted if physicians and other healthcare providers do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost
of our products by their patients’ third-party payers both in the United States and in foreign markets. Our total revenue could
also be adversely affected by changes or trends in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payers. We believe that
the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare
industry, both foreign and domestic, to reduce the cost of products and services. Given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare
costs in recent years, currently available levels of reimbursement may not continue to be available in the future for our existing products
or products under development. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the United States or
foreign markets, current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies
of third-party payers may reduce the demand for our products or adversely impact our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis.
Finally, we are in the process of applying for Government payer reimbursement for our inFoods IBS® product in the US market. If we
are unsuccessful in attaining reimbursement for this product, we will likely fall well short of our future revenue projections.
Unexpected
increases in, or inability to meet, demand for our products could require us to spend considerable resources to meet the demand or harm
our reputation and customer relationships if we are unable to meet demand.
Our
inability to meet customer demand for our products, whether as a result of manufacturing problems or supply shortfalls, could harm our
customer relationships and impair our reputation within the industry. In addition, our product manufacturing of certain product lines
is concentrated in our two manufacturing sites. Weather, natural disasters (including pandemics), fires, terrorism, political change,
governmental restrictions or stay-at-home orders in response to natural disasters (including pandemics), failure to follow specific internal
protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors, or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect
our ability to manufacture our products. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
If
we experience unexpected increases in the demand for our products, we may be required to expend additional capital resources or engage
third-party manufacturers to meet these demands. These capital resources could involve the cost of new machinery or even the cost of
new manufacturing facilities. In addition, engaging third-party manufacturers would increase manufacturing costs and reduce margins.
This would increase our capital costs or third-party expenses, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash resources. If we are
unable to develop or obtain necessary manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner or to engage third-party manufacturers to meet demand,
our total revenue could be adversely affected. Failure to cost-effectively increase production volumes, if required, or lower than anticipated
yields or production problems, including those encountered as a result of changes that we may make in our manufacturing processes to
meet increased demand or changes in applicable laws and regulations, could result in shipment delays as well as increased manufacturing
costs, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Unexpected
increases in demand for our products could also require us to obtain additional raw materials in order to manufacture products to meet
the demand. Some raw materials require significant ordering lead time and we may not be able to timely access sufficient raw materials
in the event of an unexpected increase in demand, particularly those obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers.
If
one or more of our products is claimed to be defective or does not meet the performance criteria we claim in our marketing materials,
we could be subject to product recalls, claims of liability, harm to patients or users of our products, or harm to our reputation that
could adversely affect our business.
A
claim of a defect in the design or manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry
and subject us to claims of liability for injuries and otherwise. Further, a claim that one of our products is defective or does not
actually meet the performance criteria we claim in our marketing materials, could require a product recall or otherwise have a substantial
impact on our revenues and financial performance. Any substantial underinsured loss resulting from such a claim or defect would have
a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial conditions and the damage to our reputation or product lines in the
industry could have a material adverse effect on our business.
15
We
are exposed to business risks which, if not covered by insurance, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We face
potential product liability exposure, and, if claims brought against us are successful, we could incur substantial liabilities.
We
face a number of business risks, including exposure to product liability claims, employment law claims, claims that the Company or its
officers, directors or employees have engaged in illegal or wrongful acts, claims of violation of environmental laws, and many other
possible claims. Although we maintain insurance for a number of these risks, we may face claims for types of damages, or for amounts
of damages, that are not covered by our insurance. For example, although we currently carry product liability insurance for liability
losses, there is a risk that product liability or other claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from
coverage under the terms of our policy. Also, our existing insurance may not be renewed at the same cost and level of coverage as currently
in effect or may not be renewed at all. Further, we do not currently have insurance against many environmental risks we confront in our
business. If we are held liable for a claim against which we are not insured or for damages exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage,
that claim could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Clinical
trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of studies and trials may not be predictive of
future trial results.
Clinical
trials are expensive, time consuming, and difficult to design and implement. Regulatory agencies may analyze or interpret the results
differently than we do. Even if the results of our clinical trials are favorable, the clinical trials for a number of our product candidates
may take a significant amount of time to complete. Regulatory authorities, including state and local authorities, may suspend, delay
or terminate our clinical trials at any time, require us to conduct additional clinical trials, require a particular clinical trial to
continue for a longer duration than originally planned, or require a change to our development plans such that we conduct clinical trials
for a product candidate in a different order. There is no assurance that the results of the clinical trials will be positive. A negative
clinical trial could affect our ability to obtain regulatory clearances and/or potential licensing partners. There is also no assurance
that our clinical trials will not be delayed or will be completed. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.
We
may rely on third parties to conduct or be part of our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual
duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to seek or obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.
We
rely on third-party contract research organizations (“CROs”), universities or/clinical sites collectively, (“Clinical
Research Partners”), to coordinate, monitor and conduct of our clinical trials and to manage, analyze, and interpret data for our
clinical programs. We, and our Clinical Research Partners, are required to comply with current Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”),
regulations, and guidelines issued by the FDA and by similar governmental authorities in other countries where we are conducting clinical
trials. We have an ongoing obligation to monitor the activities conducted by our Clinical Research Partners and at our clinical sites
to confirm compliance with these requirements. In the future, if we, our Clinical Research Partnersor our clinical sites fail to comply
with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform
additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. If our Clinical Research Partners do not successfully carry out
their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the
clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other
reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully
commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would
be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.
Failures
in our information technology and storage systems or data security breaches could significantly disrupt our business or force us to expend
excessive costs.
Failures
in our information technology and storage systems, many of which are outsourced to third parties, could significantly disrupt our business
and incur excessive costs.
We
rely on complex information technology systems, many of which are outsourced to third-party providers, to support our business operations
and store critical information. Our dependence on these third parties means that we are reliant on their performance, security measures,
and ability to meet our business needs. Any failures or disruptions in the services provided by these third-party vendors could result
in excessive costs or significant disruptions to our business operations.
16
Specifically,
any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies caused by our enterprise resource planning system or other outsourced systems could negatively
impact our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices, track payments, fulfill contractual
obligations, and maintain overall business operations.
Despite
our and our Clinical Research Partners’ implementation of security measures, information technology systems remain vulnerable to
damage from various sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, telecommunications or network failures, malicious human
acts, terrorism, and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and backup measures, some of our servers and those of our
Clinical Research Partners may still be susceptible to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, and similar disruptive issues.
Cybersecurity risks are escalating and pose significant threats to our operations. Cyber-attacks could result in the loss of vital company
documentation and data, or confidential third-party documents held by the company, essential for our operations.
Despite
precautionary measures to prevent unforeseen problems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and
maintain data could materially disrupt our operations and lead to significant financial costs. Furthermore, any disruption or security
breach resulting in data loss or damage, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, could result in regulatory
actions, litigation, fines or penalties, adverse publicity, increased cybersecurity protection costs, and lost revenue.
There
is also a risk that our measures and those of our third-party vendors to protect our systems from cyber-attacks may not be sufficient
to prevent attacks by new sources and methods.
Our
business could be negatively affected by the loss of or the inability to hire key personnel.
Our
future success is heavily dependent on our ability to retain key technical, sales, marketing, and executive personnel, as well as our
capacity to identify and recruit additional qualified individuals. The competition for talent is intense, both within our industry and
in the regions where we operate. As we anticipate growth in our operations, our need for additional management and other key personnel
is expected to increase. Failure to retain our existing key personnel or to promptly identify and hire qualified replacements or additional
staff to support our growth could have a detrimental impact on our business. Additionally, the loss of any key personnel, particularly
in research and development, could significantly harm our business, hinder our prospects, and obstruct the achievement of our research,
operational, or strategic objectives.
In
response to the need to reduce ongoing operating costs, we have implemented a substantial reduction in our workforce. This reduction
places an increased workload on the remaining employees and may create concerns about job security. These factors could lead to the loss
of key employees, who are critical to our future success, and may make it difficult to attract and retain new talent in these roles.
Sales
of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of
our securities.
Future
sales by the Company of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market to raise needed capital, or the perception
that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the then prevailing market price of our common stock and could make it more difficult
for us to raise funds in the future through a public offering of our securities.
17
On
September 28, 2023, we filed a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, allowing the Company to issue up
to $20,000,000 in common shares. Under this registration statement, shares of our common stock may be sold from time to time for up to
three years from the filing date. On May 10, 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC, as part of the registration statement
filed on September 28, 2023, which was declared effective on September 29, 2023. This supplement was intended to facilitate the sale
of up to $5,500,000 in common stock through an At The Market (ATM) offerings, as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act.
The
issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or other securities, could dilute our existing stockholders’ ownership interests,
potentially depress the market price of our common stock, and impair our ability to raise capital through future equity sales. The size
and impact of future issuances on the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted.
We
also have a number of stockholders who own large blocks of our common stock. If one or more of these stockholders were to sell large
portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of shares of our common
stock could be negatively affected.
In
order to attain needed capital to operate the Company, we may need to issue preferred stock, warrants, convertible debt or other financial
instruments that could have liquidation priority, requirements for interest or dividend payments, or other rights and that could be detrimental
to existing shareholders’ return on their investment in the Company.
The
price of our stock may fluctuate unpredictably in response to factors unrelated to our operating performance.
The
stock market can experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies.
These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to drop. In particular, our common stock has historically
been volatile and may continue to be unpredictable in the future. Factors that could cause fluctuations in our stock price include, but
are not limited to:
●
Announcements
by us or our competitors concerning technological innovations or new product introductions.
●
Regulatory
actions or changes, including those by the FDA, SEC, or international regulatory bodies.
●
Developments
or disputes related to patents or proprietary rights.
●
Failure
to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors.
●
Reporting
material weaknesses in our internal controls.
●
Changes
in stock market analyst recommendations or financial estimates regarding our common stock.
●
Shifts
in healthcare policy in the United States or other countries.
●
Lawsuits
or liability claims from shareholders or other parties.
●
Legal
disputes related to intellectual property or other significant litigation.
●
Possible
recalls of our products or reports of false positive/negative results.
●
Sales
of our common stock or other securities by us or our stockholders.
●
Changes
in trading volume of our common stock.
●
Variations
in quarterly operating results, whether actual or anticipated.
●
Publication
of research reports about us or our industry, or changes in securities analysts’ recommendations.
●
Effects
of natural or man-made catastrophic events, including widespread health epidemics.
●
General
stock market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance.
●
Volatility
and disruptions in capital and credit markets due to economic conditions such as rising inflation and interest rates.
●
Geopolitical
events, such as wars or political unrest, that impact the markets in which we operate.
●
Changes
in the macroeconomic environment that affect market conditions.
Additionally,
due to the limited trading volume of our common stock, substantial sales of our stock could adversely impact its market price. While
our common stock has been traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market since August 26, 2016, liquidity may be limited, and it could be challenging
to liquidate large positions without adversely affecting the stock price.
Our
ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards in the future may be subject to limitation.
Although
we have Federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $28,378,000 and California state income tax net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $26,921,000, as of May 31, 2025, use of these loss carryforwards will depend on future income in
relationship to expirations dates of these carryforwards.

1C. CYBERSECURITY
We
have implemented and maintain an information security program designed to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity
threats to our critical computer networks, third party hosted services, communications systems, hardware and software, and our critical
data including intellectual property, clinical trial participant and patient-related data, and confidential information that is proprietary,
strategic or competitive in nature, or collectively, Information Systems and Data.
18
Our
cybersecurity threat risk management processes include the following, among others:
●
We
have strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework to promote a company-wide
culture of cybersecurity risk management particularly since we utilize a third-party IT managed services vendor. This
integration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making processes at every level. Our management
team works closely with our IT department and our IT managed services to continuously evaluate and address cybersecurity risks in
alignment with our business objectives and operational needs.
●
Our
IT managed services vendor implements and maintains various technical, and organizational measures, processes, standards and policies
designed to manage and mitigate material risks from cybersecurity threats to our Information Systems and Data, including, for example:
information security policies, network and device security, encryption standards, incident response plans, disaster recovery plans,
risk management, vulnerability detection as well as security tools such as firewalls, malware protection tools, secure authentication
tools, centralized logging and monitoring tools, threat intelligence tools, and data protection tools.
●
We
maintain continuous oversight through regular monitoring, which includes annual evaluations of Service Organization Control (SOC)
reports for our providers and the implementation of additional complementary controls as needed. This proactive approach is designed
to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents that could originate from third-party interactions.
The
Board of Directors oversees cybersecurity risk management, including the practices that management implements to prevent, detect and
address risks from cybersecurity threats. The
Board of Directors receives regular quarterly briefings on cybersecurity risks including any cybersecurity incidents or threats that
may occur or have occurred from the CFO. The Board of Directors may also promptly receive information regarding any material cybersecurity
incident that may occur, including any ongoing updates regarding the same.
For
a description of the risks from cybersecurity threats that may materially affect us and how those risks may affect us see “Failures
in our information technology and storage systems or data security breaches could significantly disrupt our business or force us
to expend excessive costs” under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

2. PROPERTIES
The
Company leases its facilities. On May 31, 2025, the Company had approximately 22,000 square feet of floor space at its corporate headquarters
at 17571 Von Karman Avenue in Irvine, California, 92614 which it has been leasing since 2009. This lease was scheduled to expire on August
31, 2016, but the Company had an option to extend the term of its lease for two additional sixty-month periods. On November 30, 2015,
the Company exercised its option to extend its lease for an additional sixty-month period and entered into the First Amendment to Lease
wherein it extended its lease until August 31, 2021. On April 9, 2021, the Company exercised its second option to extend its lease for
an additional five years. When the Company extended its lease in April 2021, it was also granted an additional five- year lease extension
option. The current rent is approximately $28,000 per month and will increase on September 1, 2025, to $28,500 per month. The security
deposit is approximately $22,000.
In
November 2016, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary, Biomerica de Mexico, entered into a 10-year lease for approximately 8,100 square
feet of manufacturing space located in Mexicali, Mexico. The Company has one 10-year option to renew at the end of the initial lease
period. The current rent is approximately $3,100 per month. Biomerica de Mexico also leases a smaller unit on a month-to-month basis
for use in one manufacturing process. In addition, the Company leases a small office in Lindau, Germany on a month-to-month basis, as
headquarters for BioEurope GmbH, its Germany subsidiary.
We
believe our space is adequate for our current needs.
ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From
time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, which
may impact its financial results.
As
of May 31, 2025, there were no pending legal proceedings. However, the outcome of any future legal matters, claims, or litigation could
potentially have a material adverse effect on the Company’s quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows when resolved in
subsequent periods. Nonetheless, based on current information, management believes these matters will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis
contains forward-looking statements that are based on our management team’s expectations, beliefs, intentions, strategies, estimates
and assumptions, which statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those
expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed in the sections titled
“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” appearing elsewhere in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
OVERVIEW
We
are a global biomedical technology company that develops, patents, manufactures and markets advanced diagnostic and therapeutic products.
Our diagnostic test kits are used to analyze blood, urine, nasal, or fecal material from patients in the diagnosis of various diseases,
food intolerances, and other medical complications. They can also be used to measure or detect the presence and levels of specific bacteria,
hormones, antibodies, antigens and other substances, which may exist in the human body in extremely small concentrations. Our products
are designed to enhance the health and well-being of people, while reducing total healthcare cost.
Our
extensive range of medical diagnostic products is sold worldwide, primarily in two markets: clinical laboratories and point-of-care settings.
Most of our products are Conformite Europeenne (“CE”) marked and/or registered with regulatory agencies in various countries
for diagnostic use, with several also cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for sale in the United States.
Technological
advances in medical diagnostics have enabled diagnostic tests to be performed not only in clinical laboratories but also at home and
at the point-of-care in physicians’ offices. One of our key objectives has been to develop and market rapid diagnostic tests that
are accurate, utilize easily obtained patient specimens, and are simple to perform without the need for complex instrumentation. Our
home use (over-the-counter) and professional use (physicians’ office, clinics, etc.) rapid diagnostic test products help manage
existing medical conditions and may save lives through early detection and diagnosis of specific diseases. Traditionally, such tests
required the expertise of medical technologists and sophisticated equipment, with results often not available for days. We believe our
rapid point-of-care tests, when properly used, can be as accurate as laboratory tests. Our products require limited to no instrumentation,
deliver reliable results in minutes, and can be performed with confidence at home or in a physician’s office.
We
invest resources in the research and development of new products designed to diagnose and, in some cases, treat several major medical
diseases. These products are either internally developed or licensed from others. Our experienced and highly trained technical personnel,
including Ph.D. holders and other scientists, are dedicated to developing new products and managing technology transfer activities. Our
technical staff, many of whom, have extensive experience from previous employment at large diagnostic manufacturing companies, bring
a wealth of industry knowledge. Additionally, we rely on our Scientific Advisory Board, comprised of leading medical doctors and clinicians,
to guide our clinical studies and product development efforts.
A
key outcome from our research and development efforts is our patented diagnostic-guided therapy (“DGT”) product, developed
on the inFoods® technology platform. This innovative technology is designed to aid in the management of gastrointestinal conditions
such as irritable bowel syndrome (“IBS”) and other inflammatory diseases. The DGT product targets chronic inflammatory illnesses
that are widespread and prevalent in large markets. We have launched inFoods® IBS product, which leverages this patented technology.
The inFoods® IBS product utilizes a simple blood test to identify patient-specific foods that, when eliminated from the diet, may
help reduce IBS symptoms such as pain, bloating, diarrhea, cramping, and constipation. Unlike broad and difficult to manage dietary restrictions,
the inFoods® IBS product pinpoints a patient’s heightened immunoreactivity to specific foods known to frequently trigger IBS
symptoms. By removing the foods identified as problematic, patients can achieve relief from IBS symptoms.
21
We
have introduced our inFoods® product to select gastroenterology (“GI”) physician groups in multiple states and regions,
including collaboration with one of the largest GI groups in the U.S. This initial phase was focused on gathering real-world feedback,
optimizing physician engagement, and validating operational processes. GI physician feedback has been generally positive, and we are
continuing to expand our network by onboarding additional physician practices.
Our
dedicated sales team is focused on building strong relationships within the GI segment while selectively exploring opportunities to introduce
inFoods® to other medical specialties, including integrated health practices and primary-care providers. These efforts are intended
to lay the groundwork for broader adoption by showcasing the distinct clinical value of inFoods® across multiple healthcare channels.
Concurrently,
we are evaluating distribution, partnership, and licensing opportunities with U.S. companies to support a scalable, broad market launch.
These potential collaborations could significantly enhance the commercialization trajectory of inFoods® products, both domestically
and internationally.
We
are currently in the process of applying for US government payment or reimbursement for the inFoods IBS product through the Medicare
system. If the Company is successful in attaining reimbursement, we will move forward with applying for reimbursement of this product
by private payer insurance companies. If patients are able to attain and use our inFoods IBS® product at no cost, or with a small
co-payment, we believe this will dramatically increase our revenues from this product.
As
we continue pursue commercial opportunities in both U.S. and international markets, we remain attentive to evolving global economic conditions,
including uncertainties related to international trade policies, tariffs, and supply chain dynamics. Although these factors have not
had a material impact on our operations to date, future changes in trade regulations, tariff structures, or logistical constraints could
influence the cost, availability, or timing of materials and components used in our manufacturing processes. We continue to monitor these
developments closely and are actively implementing contingency plans, including alternative sourcing strategies and supplier diversification,
to support supply chain continuity, maintain operational efficiency, and help mitigate potential future impacts. We are also focusing
on alternative manufacturing and shipping strategies of our products through our European subsidiary (BioEurope), and our Mexican subsidiary
(BioMexico), to mitigate some of the risk these policies may have on our revenues and operations.
In
addition, in December 2023 we received FDA clearance for hp+detect™, a diagnostic test designed to detect Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. H. pylori is a prevalent infection, affecting approximately 35% of the U.S. population
and 45% of the population in Europe’s largest countries. This bacterium is recognized as the strongest known risk factor for gastric
cancer, which remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. The hp+detect™ test is marketed directly to
laboratories and is intended to provide physicians and medical centers with a reliable tool for diagnosing H. pylori infections and monitoring
treatment effectiveness. We are actively promoting hp+detect™ to large end-customer laboratories and positioning the product for
commercial adoption.
Due
to the slower-than-expected launch of our key products, inFoods® IBS and hp+detect™, we have initiated
significant cost-cutting measures to extend our cash runway and work towards increasing revenues to cover overhead costs. These measures
include a workforce reduction of nearly 15% during this fiscal year, which incurred costs such as severance, impacting typical cost trends
and margins. Additionally, we raised $2,015,000 in net proceeds from the ATM offering filed in May 2024 providing additional liquidity
to support our operations. We are actively exploring strategic opportunities to enhance and create shareholder value.
Reverse
Stock Split
Effective
April 21, 2025 (the “Effective Date”), we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, to effect a 1-for-8 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock
Split”) of our Common Stock. Beginning with the opening of trading on the Effective Date, our common stock began trading on Nasdaq
on a split-adjusted basis under the same symbol, “BMRA.” As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 8 shares of our common
stock issued and outstanding were automatically combined and converted into 1 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock. In lieu of any fractional shares, stockholders who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share instead
had their interests automatically rounded up to the next whole share, after aggregating all the fractional interests of a holder resulting
from the Reverse Stock Split.
The
Reverse Stock Split did not change the number of authorized shares of our common stock or preferred stock as set forth in our Certificate
of Incorporation, as amended. All historical share and per share data for the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements,
including for periods ending prior to the Effective Date, has been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-8 Reverse Stock Split on a retroactive
basis as if the Reverse Stock Split occurred as of the earliest period presented.

For
the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, our net sales were approximately $5,311,000, representing a decrease of $104,000, or 2%, compared
to $5,415,000 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced retail market activity, lower international
over-the-counter sales due to potential tariff impacts, and volatility in clinical laboratory demand. These declines were partially offset
by higher contract manufacturing billings and increased demand for our inFoods® IBS product.
Consolidated
cost of sales for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025 was approximately $4,813,000, or 91% of net sales, compared to $4,804,000, or 89%
of net sales, for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, reflecting a slight increase of $9,000, or 0.2%. The increase was primarily attributable
to higher contract manufacturing costs, driven by increased sales in this category, as well as higher costs associated with our inFoods®
product. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in direct labor costs. The overall margin impact also reflected a shift
in sales mix, with lower over-the-counter sales, which typically generate higher margins in the retail market.

for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, a decrease of $875,000, or 16%. This reduction reflects our strategic financial management and
was primarily attributable to a $351,000 decrease in payroll expenses following a reduction in force implemented in July 2024, a $327,000
decrease in stock compensation, a $66,000 decrease in marketing expenses for OTC products, and a $59,000 decrease in sales and marketing
outside services. Overall, the decrease in SG&A expenses demonstrates our continued commitment to strategically allocating capital
and maintaining financial discipline while pursuing growth opportunities.
Research
and Development
Our
research and development expenses were approximately $1,023,000 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, compared to $1,491,000 for the
fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, a decrease of $468,000, or 31%. The decrease was primarily driven by a $311,000 reduction in payroll
expenses following a reduction in force implemented in July 2024, $68,000 in cost saving related to our inFoods® research and development
projects, and a $33,000 reduction in research and development hp+detect™ project expenses as the research phase was completed.

Dividend
and interest income was approximately $165,000 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, compared to $431,000 for the fiscal year ended
May 31, 2024. The decrease of $266,000 was primarily attributable to lower market interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, as
well as a reduction in cash and cash equivalent balances.

and cash equivalents
$2,399,000
$4,170,000
Working
capital including cash and cash equivalents
$3,135,000
$5,527,000
The
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months is influenced by several factors, including:
●
Our
need and ability to generate additional revenue from international opportunities and our new product launches;
●
Our
need to access the capital and debt markets to meet current obligations and fund operations;
●
Our
capacity to manage operating expenses and maintain gross margins as we grow; and
●
Our
ability to retain key employees and maintain critical operations with a substantially reduced workforce; and
●
Certain
SEC regulations that limit the amount of capital the Company can raise through issuance of its equity.
Management
has analyzed the Company’s cash flow requirements through August 2026 and beyond. Based on this analysis, we believe our current
cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to meet our operating cash requirements and strategic growth objectives for the next twelve
months.
To
address our capital needs and sustain operations beyond the next year, we are actively pursuing strategies to increase sales, reduce
expenses, sell non-core assets, seek additional financing through debt or equity, and seek other strategic alternatives.
As
part of our efforts to reduce costs, we have initiated significant cost-cutting measures to extend our cash runway and work towards increasing
revenues to cover overhead costs. These measures include a workforce reduction of nearly 16% and a substantial reduction in other operating
expenses.
As
part of our financing plan, on September 28, 2023, we filed a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which
was declared effective on September 29, 2023, allowing the Company to issue up to $20,000,000 in shares of our common stock. Under this
registration statement, shares of our common stock may be sold from time to time for up to three years from the filing date. On May 10,
2024, the Company filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC, as part of this registration statement. This prospectus supplement was
intended to facilitate the sale of up to $5,500,000 in common stock through ATM offerings, as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities
Act. As part of this transaction, the Company incurred $81,000 in deferred offering costs during the year ended May 31, 2024. During
the year ended May 31, 2025, the Company sold 440,687 shares of its common stock at prices ranging from $3.06 to $8.32 pursuant to the
ATM Agreement, which resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $2,143,000 and net proceeds to the Company of $2,015,000, after deducting
commissions for each sale and legal, accounting, and other fees related to offering in the amount of $128,000.
The
Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, sales and marketing
activities, clinical studies and product development, acquisitions of assets, businesses, companies, or securities, capital expenditures,
and working capital needs.
While
we are committed to these plans, there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful or sufficient to meet our capital requirements.
These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our future viability depends on the
successful execution of our strategic plans, securing additional financing, and achieving profitable operations.
In
addition, our business is subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. “Risk
Factors”.

Operating
Activities
During
the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, cash used in operating activities was approximately $3,841,000 compared to $5,361,000 for the fiscal
year ended May 31, 2024. The primary factors contributing to this were a loss of approximately $4,973,000, an increase in inventory reserves
of $4,000, an increase in accounts receivable of $209,000, a decrease in inventories of $882,000 and a non-cash expense of approximately
$944,000. These were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $467,000, and reduction in lease liabilities
of $326,000.
During
the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was approximately $5,361,000, compared to $5,474,000 for the fiscal
year ended May 31, 2023. The primary factors contributing to this were a loss of approximately $5,978,000, a decrease in inventory reserves
of $205,000, an increase in accounts receivable of $215,000, an increase in inventories of $115,000 and a decrease in lease liability
of $297,000. These were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $246,000, and non-cash expenses of
approximately $1,211,000.
Investing
Activities
During
the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, cash used in investing activities was approximately $37,000, as compared to $115,000 for the fiscal
year ended May 31, 2024. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, we had $37,000 in expenditures related to patents. During
the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, we purchased approximately $51,000 of property and equipment and had $64,000 in expenditures related
to patents.
Financing
Activities
Cash
provided financing activities was approximately $2,111,000 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, compared to cash used in financing
activities of $81,000 in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. In fiscal year end May 31, 2025, we received net proceeds of $2,015,000
from the sale of our common stock and $15,000 from the exercise of stock options. In addition, the Company recorded a non-cash reclassification
of $84,000 in deferred offering costs during the same period. By contrast, in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, our financing activities
primarily consisted of $81,000 in payments for deferred offering costs.
During
the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, we received approximately $2,015,000 and $0, respectively, in net proceeds from the sale
of common stock. Our common stock sold and issued in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025 was issued under our shelf registration statement
filed with the SEC on September 28, 2023, which was declared effective on September 29, 2023 (the “2023 Registration Statement”).
On May 10, 2024, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to the 2023 Registration Statement with the SEC for the sale of up to $5,500,000
in common stock through ATM offerings, as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. As part of this transaction, the Company incurred
$81,000 in deferred offering costs during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024.
As
of August 29, 2025, the date on which this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, is filed with the SEC,
our 2023 Registration Statement remains subject to the offering limits set forth in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 because
our public float is less than $75 million. For so long as the Company’s public float is less than $75 million, the aggregate
market value of securities sold by the Company under the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3
during any 12 consecutive months may not exceed one-third of the Company’s public float. For purposes of this limitation, the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates, or
public float, was $9,945,252, based on 2,402,235 non-restricted shares of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates and a
price of $4.14 per share, which was the price at which our common stock was last sold on the Nasdaq Capital Market on July 24,
2025 (a date within 60 days of the date hereof), calculated in accordance with General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3. After giving
effect to the $3,315,084 offering limit imposed by General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, and after deducting the shares we sold within the
preceding 12 months, as of the date of filing this Annual Report, we may sell $231,986 shares of our common stock at this time under the
2023 Shelf Registration Statement.
24
SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS
On
July 21, 2025, the Company received a cash refund of approximately $1.1 million from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to previously
filed claims for the Employee Retention Credit (ERC), a refundable payroll tax credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
Security (CARES) Act. This amount was recorded and collected subsequent to year-end.
In
July and August 2025, the Company completed sales of its common stock under its At-the-Market (“ATM”) offering program, generating
net proceeds of approximately $919,000 subsequent to year-end.
OFF
BALANCE SHEET ITEMS
There
were no off-balance sheet arrangements as of May 31, 2025.
CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. On an ongoing basis,
we evaluate estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates
and assumptions are reasonable under the current conditions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different
future conditions.
We
believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations,
in that they require subjective or complex judgments, form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to us. These
relate to revenue recognition, inventory overhead application, inventory reserve and share based compensation. We believe estimates and
assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances; however, should future events or occurrences
result in unanticipated consequences, there could be a material impact on our future financial conditions or results of operations. We
suggest that our significant accounting policies be read in conjunction with this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. Please refer to Note 2 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for information
on Significant Accounting Policies.
REVENUE
RECOGNITION
The
Company has various contracts with customers, and these contracts specify the recognition of revenue based on the nature of the transaction.
Revenues
from product sales are recognized at the time the product is shipped, customarily FOB shipping point, which is when the transfer of control
of goods has occurred, and title passes. This applies to clinical lab products sold to domestic and international distributors, including
hospitals, clinical laboratories, medical research institutions, medical schools, and pharmaceutical companies. OTC products are sold
directly to drug stores, e-commerce customers, and distributors, while physicians’ office products are sold to physicians and distributors.
The Company does not allow for returns except in the event of defective merchandise and, therefore, does not establish an allowance for
returns. Additionally, the Company has contracts with customers that provide purchase discounts for achieving specified sales volumes.
The Company regularly evaluates the status of these contracts and does not believe any discounts will be given through the end of the
contract periods.
For
diagnostic testing services sold directly to patients or physician offices that require processing by a third-party CLIA-certified lab,
we recognize revenue once the lab has completed the test results.
For
services related to contract manufacturing, revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Services for some contract works
are invoiced and recognized as the project progresses.
25
SHARE-BASED
COMPENSATION
The
Company follows the guidance of ASC 718, Share-based Compensation (“ASC 718”), which requires the use of the fair-value based
method to determine compensation for all arrangements under which employees and others receive shares of stock or equity instruments
(options). The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses
assumptions for expected volatility, expected dividends, expected forfeiture rate, expected term, and the risk-free interest rate. The
Company has not paid dividends historically and does not expect to pay them in the foreseeable future. Expected volatilities are based
on weighted averages of the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock estimated over the expected term of the options.
The expected forfeiture rate is based on historical forfeitures experienced. The expected term of options granted is derived using the
“simplified method” which computes expected term as the average of the sum of the vesting term plus the contract term as
historically the Company had limited exercise activity surrounding its options. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
curve in effect at the time of grant for the period of the expected term. The grant date fair value of the award is recognized under
the straight-line attribution method.
VALUATION
OF INVENTORIES, NET
Our
inventories are made up of raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods and are valued at the
lower of cost (determined using a combination of specific lot identification and the first-in, first-out methods) or net realizable value.
We
record valuation reserves for inventory items with excess quantities and obsolescence exposure. These reserves are estimates of a reduction
in value to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Management
evaluates quantities on hand, physical condition, and technical functionality as these characteristics may be impacted by anticipated
customer demand for current products and new product introductions. The reserve is adjusted based on such evaluation, with a corresponding
provision included in cost of sales. Abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs and wasted material are recognized
as current period charges and the allocation of fixed production overhead is based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.
Our inventory valuation reserves totaled $471,000 and $467,000 as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, representing approximately 24% and 16% of
our inventory, respectively.
RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Recent
ASU’s issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and guidance issued by the SEC did not, or are not
believed by the management to, have a material effect on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.
In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The ASU includes enhanced disclosure
requirements, primarily related to significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to and used by the chief operating decision
maker (“CODM”). The amendments are to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements.
ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07
on May 31, 2025, and the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”. The ASU includes
enhanced disclosure requirements, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments are
to be applied prospectively in the financial statements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024,
with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 on May 31, 2025, and the adoption of this update did not have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In
November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation
Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)”. The ASU includes enhanced disclosure requirements, which mandates enhanced transparency in financial
statements by requiring detailed disclosures of specific expenses like inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation, and
intangible asset amortization. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting
periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the
effect of adopting this pronouncement on our financial statements and disclosures.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Attached
as exhibits to this Form 10-K are certifications of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”)
that are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. This “Disclosure Controls and Procedures” section includes
information concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in the certifications.
EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS
Our
management evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. The disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.
Our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level as of May 31, 2025.
Based on that evaluation the CEO and CFO concluded that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file and submit under
the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules
and forms; and (2) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Company
management, including the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of May 31, 2025, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
was effective.
CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during
the quarter ended May 31, 2025, that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Company
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
The
effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of
judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures. Because of these inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
27
Company
management, with the participation of the CEO and the CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,
as of the end of the period covered by this report. In making this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based
on this assessment, management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, believes that, as of May 31, 2025, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
Company
management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and its internal controls
over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing improvements, as necessary and
as funds allow.
Note:
This 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only
management’s report in this 10-K.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Biomerica,
Inc.
Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Biomerica, Inc. (the “Company”) as of May 31,
2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for
each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion,
the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as
of May 31, 2025 and 2024, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Going
Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations
and has an accumulated deficit and limited liquid resources. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (continued)
Critical
Audit Matter
The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which
they relate.
Inventory
Valuation
Critical
Audit Matter Description
As
described in Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company values inventory at the lower of cost or
net realizable value with cost inclusive of estimates for reasonable allocations of labor and overhead costs. Also, management
periodically reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence. Management evaluates quantities on hand, physical condition,
and technical functionality as these may be impacted by customer demand for current products and new product introductions. Auditing
the Company’s estimates for capitalized labor and overhead was challenging due to the extensive use of estimates throughout
this process, including the amount of labor and overhead costs allocable to inventory production and the amount of labor and
overhead costs allocable to specific ending inventory product quantities. Auditing the Company’s estimates for slow-moving and
obsolete inventories was challenging due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting future sales and usage of a significant
number of diverse inventory items.
How
the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
To
test the valuation of the Company’s inventory, we performed the following audit procedures:
●
Obtained
an understanding of the methodologies and policies used by management to estimate capitalized labor and overhead and inventory reserves;
we obtained an understanding of key internal controls and assessed their overall appropriateness;
●
Tested
the reasonableness of the production labor and overhead cost pools and the reasonableness of inventory quantities produced; we
recalculated the allocable labor and overhead rate per unit produced; we recalculated the amount of capitalized labor and overhead
based on specific product quantities on hand at the end of the fiscal year; we performed sensitivity analyses to determine the
impact of adjustments to management’s estimates; and
●
Tested
the accuracy of key data inputs that are the primary drivers for determining the quantitative inventory reserves; these inputs included
inventory quantities on hand, approximate age of the inventory quantities, and estimated inventory reserve percentages; we evaluated management’s qualitative analysis of specific inventory product reserves to the extent it differed
from the results of management’s quantitative analysis.

YEARS
ENDED MAY 31, 2025 AND 2024
NOTE
1: ORGANIZATION
Biomerica,
Inc. and its subsidiaries (which includes wholly-owned subsidiaries, Biomerica de Mexico and BioEurope GmbH) is a global biomedical technology
company that develops, patents, manufactures and markets advanced diagnostic and therapeutic products used at the point-of-care (physicians’
offices and over-the-counter through drugstores and online) and in hospital/clinical laboratories for detection and/or treatment of medical
conditions and diseases. Our diagnostic test products utilize immunoassay technology to analyze blood, urine, nasal, or fecal material
from patients in the diagnosis of various diseases, food intolerances and other medical complications, and to measure the level of specific
hormones, antibodies, antigens, or other substances, which may exist in the human body in extremely small concentrations. Our other existing
products are primarily focused on gastrointestinal diseases, food intolerances, and certain esoteric tests. Company’s products
are designed to enhance the health and well-being of people, while reducing total healthcare costs.
Our
primary focus is the research, development, commercialization and in certain cases regulatory approval, of patented, diagnostic-guided
therapy (“DGT”) products to treat gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (“IBS”), and other
inflammatory diseases. These products are directed at chronic inflammatory illnesses that are widespread, common, and address very large
markets. Our inFoods® IBS product uses a simple blood sample and is designed to identify patient-specific foods that, when removed
from the diet, may alleviate IBS symptoms such as pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Instead of broad and difficult to manage
dietary restrictions, the inFoods® IBS product works by identifying specific foods that may be causing an abnormally high immune
response in the patient, which in turn can lead to abdominal pain and cramping, bloating, diarrhea and constipation. A food identified
as positive, which is causing an abnormal immune response in the patient, is simply removed from the diet to help alleviate IBS symptoms.
Our
existing medical diagnostic products are sold worldwide primarily in two markets: a) clinical laboratories and b) point-of-care (physicians’
offices and over-the-counter). Most of our products have been granted Conformite Europeenne (“CE”) marked regulatory clearance
for sale throughout Europe, and/or are sold for diagnostic use where they are registered by each country’s regulatory agency. In
addition, some products are cleared for sale in the United States by the FDA.
NOTE
2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION
The
consolidated financial statements for the years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, include the accounts of Biomerica, Inc. (“Biomerica”)
as well as its wholly-owned German subsidiary (“BioEurope GmbH”) and Mexican subsidiary (“Biomerica de Mexico”).
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
ACCOUNTING
ESTIMATES
The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These estimates
also impact the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Key estimates include the allowance for doubtful
accounts, based on both current and historical practices with customers; variable consideration in revenue recognition, estimated based
on agreements that include guarantees of specified profit margins, requiring adjustments based on actual sales performance and market
conditions, stock option forfeiture rates, calculated using historical data; and inventory obsolescence, where inventory is stated at
the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV) and assessed through judgments based on projected and historical usage of materials.
The valuation of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets also involves assumptions such as the borrowing rate at lease commencement
and the likelihood of lease extensions.
These
estimates are critical to our financial reporting, and actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
FS-8
REVERSE STOCK SPLIT
Effective April 21, 2025 (the “Effective Date”),
the Company’s board of directors approved a one-for-eight reverse stock split of the Company’s
outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Each 8 shares of the common stock of the Company, par value
of $0.08 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split automatically reclassified, combined, converted
and changed into one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock. Beginning with the opening of trading on the Effective Date,
our common stock began trading on Nasdaq on a split-adjusted basis under the same symbol, “BMRA.” In addition, a proportionate
adjustment was made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding options entitling
the holders to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock and upon the vesting of restricted stock units. No fractional shares
were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, the Company’s stockholders who otherwise would have been entitled to
a fraction of a share received a full share of common stock. The Reverse Stock Split did not change the number of authorized shares of
our common stock or preferred stock as set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended. All common stock, per share and related
information presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the date of the Reverse Stock Split,
have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.
LIQUIDITY
AND GOING CONCERN
The
Company has incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $53,168,000
as of May 31, 2025. As of May 31, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2,399,000
and working capital of approximately $3,135,000.
On
September 28, 2023, the Company filed a new “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, to replace the expiring
S-3 that was filed in July 2020, which was declared effective on September 29, 2023, allowing the Company to issue up to $20,000,000
in common shares. Under this registration statement, shares
of our common stock may be sold from time to time for up to three years from the filing date. On May 10, 2024, the Company filed a prospectus
supplement with the SEC to facilitate the sale of up to $5,500,000
in common stock through ATM offerings, as defined in Rule 415
under the Securities Act (the “2024 ATM Offering”). As part of this transaction, the Company incurred $81,000
in deferred offering costs during the year ended May 31, 2024.
During
the year ended May 31, 2025, the Company sold 440,687
shares of its common stock at prices ranging from $3.06
to $8.32
pursuant to the ATM Agreement, which resulted in gross proceeds
of approximately $2,143,000
and net proceeds to the Company of $2,015,000,
after deducting commissions for each sale and legal, accounting, and other fees related to offering in the amount of $128,000.
The
Company intends to use the net proceeds from any funds raised through the ATM offering for general corporate purposes, including, but
not limited to, sales and marketing activities, clinical studies and product development, acquisitions of assets, businesses, companies,
or securities, capital expenditures, and working capital needs
As
of May 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2,399,000
and $4,170,000,
respectively. As of May 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company had working capital of approximately $3,135,000
and $5,527,000,
respectively.
The
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months is influenced by several factors, including:
●
Our
need and ability to generate additional revenue from international opportunities and sales within the US of existing products, and
from our new product launches;
●
Our
need to access the capital and debt markets to meet current obligations and fund operations;
●
Our
capacity to manage operating expenses and maintain or increase gross margins as we grow;
●
Our
ability to retain key employees and maintain critical operations with a substantially reduced workforce; and
●
Certain
SEC regulations that limit the amount of capital the Company can raise through issuance of its equity.
Management
has analyzed the Company’s cash flow requirements through August 2026 and beyond. Based on this analysis, we believe our current
cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to meet our operating cash requirements and strategic growth objectives for the next twelve
months.
To
address our capital needs and sustain operations beyond the next year, we are actively pursuing strategies to increase sales, reduce
expenses, sell non-core assets, seek additional financing through debt or equity, and seek other strategic alternatives. While we are
committed to these plans, there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful or sufficient to meet our capital requirements
These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our future viability depends on the
successful execution of our strategic plans, securing additional financing, and achieving profitable operations.
The
Company’s consolidated financial statements as of May 31, 2025 were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The
Company has financial instruments whereby the fair market value of the financial instruments could be different than the amount recorded
on a historical basis. The Company’s consolidated financial instruments consist of its cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
and accounts payable. The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments approximate their fair values. The Company also
maintains an investment in a privately held company (see below).
CONCENTRATION
OF CREDIT RISK
The
Company maintains cash balances at certain financial institutions in excess of amounts insured by federal agencies. From time to time,
the Company has uninsured balances. The Company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risks.
The
Company provides credit in the normal course of business to customers throughout the United States and in foreign markets. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and requires accelerated prepayment in some circumstances.
Our
net sales were approximately $5,311,000 for
fiscal 2025, compared to $5,415,000 for
fiscal 2024. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025, and 2024, the Company had two and one distributor each year that accounted for
41%
and 33%
of our net sales, respectively.
Total
gross receivables as of May 31, 2025, and 2024 were approximately $757,000
and $966,000,
respectively. As of May 31, 2025, and 2024, the Company had four distributors, respectively, that accounted for a total of 69%
and 64%
of gross accounts receivable, respectively. Of the 69%
as of May 31, 2025, 27%
was owed by a distributor in North America.
For
the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, purchases from one vendor accounted for approximately 12%
of the Company’s raw material purchases, compared to approximately 16%
for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024.
FS-9
GEOGRAPHIC
CONCENTRATION
As
of May 31, 2025 and 2024, approximately $483,000
and $537,000,
respectively, of Biomerica’s gross inventory was located in Mexicali, Mexico.
As
of May 31, 2025 and 2024, approximately $10,000
and $14,000,
respectively, of Biomerica’s property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, was located in Mexicali,
Mexico.
CASH
AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash
and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market accounts with original maturities of less than three months.
ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE, NET
The
Company extends unsecured credit to its customers as part of its standard business practices. International customers are typically required
to prepay until a credit history with the Company is established, at which point credit levels are determined based on various criteria.
Initial credit limits for distributors are approved by designated officers or managers, while any increases require authorization from
upper-level management.
The
Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (codified as
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326) on June 1, 2023. ASC 326 adds to U.S. GAAP the current expected credit loss
(“CECL”) model, a measurement model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326,
the Company evaluated receivables on a quarterly basis and adjusted the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly. Balances over ninety
days old were usually reserved for unless collection
was reasonably assured. Under the application of ASC 326, the Company’s historical credit loss experience provides the basis for
the estimation of expected credit losses, as well as current economic and business conditions, and anticipated future economic events
that may impact collectability. In developing its expected credit loss estimate, the Company evaluated the appropriate grouping of financial
assets based upon its evaluation of risk characteristics, including consideration of the types of products and services sold. Account
balances are written off against the allowance for expected credit losses after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential
for recovery is considered remote.
Occasionally,
certain long-standing customers who routinely place large orders will have unusually large receivable balances relative to the total
gross receivables. Management monitors the payments for these large balances closely and very often requires payment of existing invoices
before shipping new sales orders.
As
of May 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company has established an allowance of approximately $26,000
and $19,000,
respectively, for credit losses.
PREPAID
EXPENSES AND OTHER
The
Company occasionally prepays for items such as inventory, insurance, and other items. These items are reported as prepaid expenses and
other, until either the inventory is physically received, or the insurance and other items are utilized.
As
of May 31, 2025 and 2024, the prepaids were approximately $255,000
and $238,000,
respectively, comprised of prepayments to insurance and various other suppliers.
INVENTORIES,
NET
The
Company values inventory at the lower of cost (determined using a combination of specific lot identification and the first-in, first-out
methods) or net realizable value. Management periodically reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence. Management evaluates
quantities on hand, physical condition, and technical functionality as these characteristics may be impacted by anticipated customer
demand for current products and new product introductions. The reserve is adjusted based on such evaluation, with a corresponding provision
included in cost of sales. Abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs, and wasted material are recognized as
current period charges and the allocation of fixed production overhead is based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.

and $467,000,
respectively.
PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT, NET
Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for additions and major improvements are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance costs are
charged to operations as incurred. When property and equipment are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and gains or losses from sales, retirements, and dispositions are credited
or charged to income.
Depreciation
and amortization are provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from 5
to 10
years, using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements
are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. Depreciation and amortization expense
on property and equipment amounted to approximately $66,000
and $63,000
for the years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
INTANGIBLE
ASSETS, NET
Intangible
assets include trademarks, product rights, technology rights, and patents, and are accounted for based on Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”), ASC 350 Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”). In that regard, intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
Intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, not to exceed 18
years for marketing and distribution rights and 10
years for purchased technology use rights. Patents are amortized
over their individual useful lives, which average approximately 15
years. Amortization expense was approximately $21,000
and $18,000
for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not
be recoverable.
The
Company assesses the recoverability of these intangible assets by determining whether the amortization of the asset’s balance over
its remaining life can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows. The Company uses a qualitative assessment to determine
whether there was any impairment. There was no
impairment of intangible assets for the years ended May 31,
2025 and 2024.
INVESTMENTS
The
Company has made investments in a privately held Polish distributor, which is primarily engaged in distributing medical products and
devices, including the distribution of the products sold by the Company. The Company invested approximately $165,000
into the Polish distributor and owns approximately 6%
of the investee.
Equity
holdings in nonmarketable unconsolidated entities in which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence (“Cost Method
Holdings”) are accounted for at the Company’s initial cost, minus any impairment (if any), plus or minus changes resulting
from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar holding or security of the same issuer. Dividends
received are recorded as other dividend and interest income.
The
Company assesses its equity holdings for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an
equity holding may not be recoverable. Management reviewed the underlying net assets of the Company’s equity method holding as
of May 31, 2025 and determined that the Company’s proportionate economic interest in the entity indicates that the equity holding
was not impaired. There were no observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or a similar holding or security of the
Company’s Cost Method Holding during the year ended May 31, 2025.
FS-11
SHARE-BASED
COMPENSATION
The
Company follows the guidance of ASC 718, Share-based Compensation, which requires the use of the fair-value based method to determine
compensation for all arrangements under which employees and others receive shares of stock or equity instruments. The Company grants
stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under its equity incentive plans. The Company measures all share-based
payment awards at their grant-date fair value. RSUs are valued based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date
of grant. The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses assumptions
for expected volatility, expected dividends, expected forfeiture rate, expected term, and the risk-free interest rate. The Company has
not paid dividends historically and does not expect to pay them in the foreseeable future. Expected volatilities are based on weighted
averages of the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock estimated over the expected term of the options. The expected
forfeiture rate is based on historical forfeitures experienced. The expected term of options granted is derived using the “simplified
method” which computes expected term as the average of the sum of the vesting term plus the contract term as historically the Company
had limited exercise activity surrounding its options. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
time of grant for the period of the expected term. The grant date fair value of the award is recognized under the straight-line attribution
method.
The
Company expensed approximately $460,000
and $837,000
of share-based compensation during the years ended May 31,
2025 and 2024, respectively.
In
applying the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the following assumptions used in the valuation of awards issued for years ended May

REVENUE
RECOGNITION
The
Company has various contracts with customers, and these contracts specify the recognition of revenue based on the nature of the transaction.
Revenues
from product sales are recognized at the time the product is shipped, customarily FOB shipping point, which is when the transfer of control
of goods has occurred and title passes. This applies to clinical lab products sold to domestic and international distributors, including
hospitals, clinical laboratories, medical research institutions, medical schools, and pharmaceutical companies. OTC products are sold
directly to drug stores, e-commerce customers, and distributors, while physicians’ office products are sold to physicians and distributors.
The Company does not allow returns except in cases of defective merchandise, and therefore, does not establish an allowance for returns.
Additionally, the Company has contracts with customers that provide purchase discounts contingent on achieving specified sales volumes.
These contracts are regularly evaluated, and the Company does not anticipate granting any discounts through the end of the contract period.
Furthermore,
the Company offers margin guarantees to certain retail drug store customers to ensure a minimum profit margin. Should pricing adjustments
cause these margins to fall below the agreed-upon thresholds, the Company is committed to compensating for the shortfall. This arrangement
introduces variable consideration into our revenue recognition process. These considerations are estimated monthly based on actual sales
and potential price reductions, ensuring accurate and compliant revenue reporting.
For
diagnostic testing services sold directly to patients or physician offices that require processing by a third-party CLIA-certified lab,
we recognize revenue once the lab has completed the test results.
For
services related to contract manufacturing, revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Services for some contract work
are invoiced and recognized as the project progresses.
As
of May 31, 2025, the Company had approximately $55,000
of advances from domestic customers, which are prepayments
on orders for future shipments.

RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT
Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company expensed approximately $1,023,000
and $1,491,000
of research and development costs during the years ended May
31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
INCOME
TAXES
The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Deferred tax assets and liabilities
arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial
statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and the benefits of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
These temporary differences and the benefits of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are measured using enacted tax rates.
A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that management considers it is more likely than not that
a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining the valuation allowance, the Company considers factors such as the reversal
of deferred income tax assets, projected taxable income, and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies. A change
to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense. As of May 31, 2025 and 2024, in accordance with
ASC 740, the Company has a valuation allowance for all of its net deferred tax assets. During the year ended May 31, 2025, this valuation
allowance was increased to $11,748,000,
which fully covers the net deferred tax asset of $11,748,000.
The
Company accounts for its uncertain tax provisions by using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more
likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of related
appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize. The amount
of benefit to recognize is measured as the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized. The tax position is derecognized
when it is no longer more likely than not capable of being sustained. On subsequent recognition and measurement, the maximum amount which
is more likely than not to be recognized at each reporting date will represent the Company’s best estimate, given the information
available at the reporting date, although the outcome of the tax position is not absolute or final. The Company elected to follow an
accounting policy to classify accrued interest related to liabilities for income taxes within the “Interest expense” line
and penalties related to liabilities for income taxes within the “Other expense” line of the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss.
During
the year ended May 31, 2025, the Company had a net operating loss (“NOL”) that generated deferred tax assets for NOL carryforwards.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statements and income tax carrying
values using tax rates in effect for the years such differences are expected to reverse. Due to uncertainties surrounding our ability
to generate future taxable income and consequently realize such deferred income tax assets, the Company has determined that it is more
likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company has established a full valuation allowance
against its deferred tax assets as of May 31, 2025.
The
Company’s policy is to recognize any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
For the year ended May 31, 2025, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
ADVERTISING
COSTS
The
Company reports the cost of all advertising as expense in the period in which those costs are incurred. Advertising costs were approximately
$35,000
and $101,000
for the years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The
subsidiary located in Mexico operates primarily using the Mexican peso. The subsidiary located in Germany operates primarily using
the U.S. dollar, with an immaterial amount of transactions occurring using the Euro. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these
subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the year, and revenues and costs are translated using
average exchange rates for the year. The resulting adjustments to assets and liabilities are presented as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss. There are no foreign currency transaction gains or losses that are included in the
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024.
FS-13
RIGHT-OF-USE
ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES
In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standard update which requires lessees
to recognize most leases on the balance sheet with a corresponding right-of-use asset. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s
right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from
the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value
of fixed lease payments over the lease term. Leases are classified as financing or operating which will drive the expense recognition
pattern. The Company has elected to exclude short-term leases. The Company leases office space and copy machines, all of which are operating
leases. Most leases include the option to renew and the exercise of the renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. Options
to extend or terminate a lease are considered in the lease term to the extent that the option is reasonably certain of exercise. The
leases do not include the options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited
by the expected lease term. For additional information, see Note 9-Commitments and Contingencies.
NET
LOSS PER SHARE
Basic
loss per share is computed as net loss divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss
per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options, warrants and other convertible
securities using the treasury stock method. The total amounts of anti-dilutive stock options not included in the loss per share calculation
for the years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024 were 413,866
and 434,954,
respectively.
SEGMENT
REPORTING
The
Company defines its segments on the basis in which internally reported financial information is reviewed by the CODM to analyze financial
performance, make decisions, and allocate resources. The Company manages its operations as a single1
operating and reportable segment, which focus on the development,
manufacture, marketing, and sale of diagnostic products. As all material financial information is included in the consolidated results,
the Company has identified one reportable segment. The CODM uses net
loss and cash flow information to evaluate performance, including detailed cost information as part of the budget and forecasting process
and considers budget-to-actual variances on a regular basis when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources.
The measure of profit or loss of the operating segment is net loss as reported in the consolidated financial statements included in this
annual report.
The
accounting policies used in the segment reporting are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
The Company’s CODM is the Chief Executive Officer.
The
Company’s reportable segment product sales, net and net income (loss) for the years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024 consisted of the

STOCK
OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK PLANS
In
December 2014, the Company adopted and shareholders approved a stock option and restricted stock plan (the “2014 Plan”).
Subsequently, in December 2017, the Company adopted and shareholders approved a stock option and restricted stock plan (the “2017
Plan”). In February 2020, the Board approved the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan” and on December 11, 2020,
the shareholders of the Company approved the 2020 Plan. In April 2023, the Board approved the Company’s 2023 Stock Incentive Plan
(the “2023 Plan”) and on December 7, 2023, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2023 Plan. On December 13, 2024,
the Board approved the Company’s 2024 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2024 Plan” and collectively with the 2014 Plan, 2017
Plan, 2020 Plan and 2023 Plan, the “Equity Incentive Plans”) and on December 7, 2024, the shareholders of the Company approved
the 2024 Plan.
The
Equity Incentive Plans provide that non-qualified options and incentive stock options and restricted stock may be granted to directors,

COMMON
STOCK ACTIVITY
On
September 28, 2023, the Company filed a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, allowing the Company to
issue up to $20,000,000
in common shares. Under this registration statement, shares
of our common stock may be sold from time to time for up to three years from the filing date. On May 10, 2024, the Company filed a prospectus
supplement with the SEC, as part of the registration statement filed on September 28, 2023, which was declared effective on September
29, 2023. This supplement was intended to facilitate the sale of up to $5,500,000
in common stock through ATM offerings, as defined in Rule 415
under the Securities Act.
During
the year ended May 31, 2025, the Company sold 440,687
shares of its common stock at prices ranging from $3.06 to
$8.32 pursuant to the ATM Agreement, which resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $2,143,000 and net proceeds to the Company of
$2,015,000, after deducting commissions for each sale and legal, accounting, and other fees related to offering in the amount of $128,000,
including $84,000 of previously capitalized deferred offering cost.

The
Company has provided a valuation allowance of approximately $11,748,000
and $10,369,000
as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The net change in
the valuation allowance for the years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024 was an increase of $1,379,000
and $1,428,000,
respectively. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its United States and foreign deferred tax assets in each of
the years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024 because the Company’s management believes that it is more likely than not that these assets
will not be realized.
On
May 31, 2025, the Company has Federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $28,378,000.
On May 31, 2025, the Company has California state income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $26,921,000.
For tax reporting purposes, operating loss carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income; such carryforwards expire in
varying amounts beginning in 2025 and 2039 for federal and state purposes, respectively. Federal net operating losses beginning in 2018
have no expiration date.
FS-17
As
of May 31, 2025, the Company has Federal research and development tax credit carryforward of approximately $978,000.
The Federal credits begin to expire in 2028. The Company also had similar credit carryforwards for state purposes of $596,000
on May 31, 2025, which do not expire.
Pursuant
to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Sections 382 and 383, annual use of the Company’s net operating loss (“NOL”)
and credit carryforwards may be limited by statute because of a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50%. Pursuant to Sections
382 and 383 of the IRC, the annual use of the Company’s NOLs and credit carryforwards would be limited if there is a cumulative
change of ownership (as that term is defined in Section 382(g) of the IRC of greater than 50% in a three-year period). Management has
not performed an analysis to determine if the Company has had a cumulative change in ownership of greater than 50%.
For
the year ended May 31, 2025, the Company performed an analysis and has not identified any uncertain tax positions as defined under
ASC 740. Should such position be identified in the future, and should the Company owe interest and penalties as a result of this,
these would be recognized as interest expense and other expense, respectively, in the consolidated financial statements. The Company
is generally no longer subject to any income tax examinations by US federal or state tax authorities for years before fiscal
2021.
The
2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) changed the treatment of Section 174 research and experimental costs beginning January 1, 2022. Historically,
taxpayers had the option of expensing Section 174 costs currently or amortizing over five years. The TCJA provision required taxpayers
to capitalize such costs and amortize over five years for research conducted domestically or fifteen years if conducted outside of the
U.S.
The
One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was signed by President Trump on July 4, 2025. OBBBA generally removes the capitalization
requirement for domestic research and development expenditures, allowing the Company the option to expense Section 174 costs again. We
do not expect this change in law to have any material effect on the Company.

9: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
OPERATING
LEASES
The
Company leases facilities in Irvine, California and Mexicali, Mexico.
As
of May 31, 2025, the Company had approximately 22,000
square feet of floor space at its corporate headquarters at
17571 Von Karman Avenue in Irvine, California. This facility includes administration, research and development, certain manufacturing,
shipping and inventory storage. The lease for its headquarters expires in August 2026. The Company has the option to extend the lease
for an additional five-year term. The Company made a security deposit of approximately $22,000.
In
November 2016, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary, Biomerica de Mexico, entered into a 10-year lease for approximately 8,100 square
feet of manufacturing space. The Company has one 10-year option to renew at the end of the initial lease period. Biomerica de Mexico
also leases a smaller unit on a month-to-month basis for use in one manufacturing process.
In
addition, the Company leases a small office in Lindau, Germany on a month-to-month basis, as headquarters for BioEurope GmbH, its Germany
subsidiary.
For
purposes of determining straight-line rent expense, the lease term is calculated from the date the Company first takes possession of
the facility, including any periods of free rent and any renewal options periods that the Company is reasonably certain of exercising.
The Company’s office and equipment leases generally have contractually specified minimum rent and annual rent increases are included
in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and related lease liabilities. Additionally, under these lease arrangements, the Company
may be required to pay directly, or reimburse the lessors, for some maintenance and operating costs. Such amounts are generally variable
and therefore not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and related lease liabilities but are instead recognized as variable
lease expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss when they are incurred.

RETIREMENT
SAVINGS PLAN
Effective
September 1, 1986, the Company established a 401(k) plan for the benefit of its employees. The plan permits eligible employees to contribute
to the plan up to the maximum percentage of total annual compensation allowable under the limits of IRC Sections 415, 401(k) and 404.
The Company, at the discretion of its Board of Directors, may make contributions to the plan in amounts determined by the Board each
year. No contributions by the Company have been made since the plan’s inception.
LITIGATION
The
Company is, from time to time, involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While
the amounts claimed may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot presently be determined because of considerable uncertainties that
exist. Therefore, it is possible the outcome of such legal proceedings, claims, and litigation could have a material effect on quarterly
or annual operating results or cash flows when resolved in a future period. However, based on facts currently available, management believes
such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.
There
were no legal proceedings pending as of May 31, 2025.
CONTRACT
AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS
The
Company has one royalty agreement in which it has obtained rights to manufacture and market certain products for the life of the
products. Royalty expenses of approximately $7,000 and
$10,000 is
included in cost of sales for the agreement for each of the years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Sales of products
manufactured under these agreements comprise approximately 1%
of total sales for the years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company may license other products or technology in the
future as it deems necessary for conducting business. The Company has other royalty agreements; however, they are not considered
material.
NOTE
10: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On
July 21, 2025, the Company received a cash refund of approximately $1.1
million from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to
previously filed claims for the Employee Retention Credit (ERC), a refundable payroll tax credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security (CARES) Act. This amount was recorded and collected subsequent to year-end.
In
July and August 2025, the Company completed sales of its common stock under its At-the-Market (“ATM”) offering program, generating
net proceeds of approximately $919,000
subsequent to year-end.
