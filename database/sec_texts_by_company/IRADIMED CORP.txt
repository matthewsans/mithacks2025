Table of ContentsPART IITEM 1. BUSINESSOverviewIRADIMED CORPORATION (“IRadimed”, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms) develops, manufactures, markets and distributes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (“MRI”) compatible medical devices and related accessories, disposables and services relating to them. We were originally incorporated in Oklahoma under the name IRI Development, Inc. in 1992, and we merged our Oklahoma corporation into the newly formed Delaware corporation in April 2014.MRidium 3860+ MRI Compatible IV Infusion Pump SystemWe are the only known provider of a non-magnetic intravenous (“IV”) infusion pump system that is specifically designed to be safe for use during MRI procedures and operates dependably in magnetic fields up to 10,000 gauss. We were the first to develop an infusion delivery system that largely eliminates many of the dangers and problems present during MRI procedures. Standard infusion pumps contain magnetic and electronic components which can create radio frequency interference and are dangerous to operate in the presence of the powerful magnet that drives an MRI system. Our patented MRidium® MRI compatible IV infusion pump system has been designed with a non-magnetic ultrasonic motor, uniquely designed non-ferrous parts and other special features to safely and predictably deliver anesthesia and other IV fluids during various MRI procedures. Our pump solution provides a seamless approach that enables accurate, safe and dependable fluid delivery before, during and after an MRI scan, which is important to critically ill patients who cannot be removed from their vital medications, and children and infants who must generally be sedated to remain immobile during an MRI scan.Each IV infusion pump system consists of an MRidium® MRI compatible IV infusion pump, non-magnetic mobile stand, proprietary disposable IV tubing sets and many of these systems contain additional optional upgrade accessories.IRadimed 3880 MRI Compatible Patient Vital Signs Monitoring SystemOur 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system has been designed with non-magnetic components and other special features to safely and accurately monitor a patient’s vital signs during various MRI procedures. The IRADIMED 3880 system operates dependably in magnetic fields up to 30,000 gauss, which means it can operate virtually anywhere in the MRI scanner room. The IRADIMED 3880 has a compact, lightweight design allowing it to travel with the patient from their critical care unit to the MRI and back, resulting in increased patient safety through uninterrupted vital signs monitoring and decreasing the amount of time critically ill patients are away from critical care units. The features of the IRADIMED 3880 include: wireless Electrocardiogram (“ECG”) with dynamic gradient filtering; wireless blood oxygen saturation monitoring (“SpO2”) using Masimo® algorithms; non-magnetic respiratory carbon dioxide (“CO2”); invasive and non-invasive blood pressure; patient temperature; and optional advanced multi-gas anesthetic agent unit featuring continuous Minimum Alveolar Concentration measurements. The IRADIMED 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system has an easy-to-use design and allows for the effective communication of patient vital signs information to clinicians.With the expanding use of MRI procedures, both traditional procedures, and intraoperative and interventional procedures, safe and reliable infusion delivery and patient monitoring in an MRI environment is becoming increasingly important to hospitals and other medical providers. Our founder, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of our Board of Directors (the “Board” or the “Board of Directors”), Roger Susi, is a pioneer in the MRI compatible medical device industry, having invented the first MRI compatible patient monitoring system in 1986 and the first non-magnetic MRI compatible IV infusion system in 2004.We sell our products primarily to hospitals and acute care facilities, both in the United States and internationally. We currently employ a direct sales strategy in the United States and as of December 31, 2024, our direct 1

Internationally, we market our products into approximately 80 countries through the use of independent distributors.As of December 31, 2024 we have sold approximately 7,832 MRI compatible IV infusion pump systems and approximately 2,679 of our 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring systems. We generate revenue from the sale of MRI compatible medical devices and related accessories, extended warranty agreements, services related to maintaining our products and the sale of disposable products used with our devices. In fiscal year 2024, our revenue was $73.2 million and our income from operations was $22.0 million representing an operating profit margin of 30 percent. Refer to the information contained under the caption “Financial Highlights and Outlook” regarding our outlook for fiscal year 2025.History and DevelopmentMr. Susi founded Invivo Research Inc. (“Invivo Research”) in 1979 where he developed the first MRI compatible patient monitoring system. Mr. Susi served as the President of Invivo Research from 1979 until 1998, and as its Chairman of the Board of Directors from 1998 until 2000. Under Mr. Susi’s leadership, Invivo Research matured from a start-up medical device company into a leading producer of vital signs monitoring devices used during MRI procedures. Invivo Research was acquired by Invivo Corporation (“Invivo”) in 1992, which began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market in 1994. Mr. Susi served as a Director of Invivo from 1998 until 2000 and oversaw technical areas from 2000 to 2004. Invivo was acquired by Intermagnetics General Corporation in 2004, which was later acquired by Koninklijke Philips NV (NYSE: PHG).Mr. Susi began exploring the market for an MRI compatible IV infusion pump while at Invivo. Invivo subsequently disclaimed any interest in the infusion pump and acknowledged that Mr. Susi was free to pursue the infusion pump development for his own account. Accordingly, Mr. Susi began the formal and detailed development of what subsequently has become our MRidium MRI compatible IV infusion pump system. This first-generation MRI compatible IV infusion pump system and its associated proprietary IV tubing sets obtained FDA 510(k) clearance in March 2005 after which we began our sales and marketing efforts.We commenced international sales through a network of distributors and in 2006; we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Mallinckrodt/Tyco Healthcare (now part of Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT)) for domestic and Canadian distribution of our products including the MRidium 3850 MRI compatible IV infusion pump system (the predecessor to our current 3860+ model). The exclusive arrangement ended in 2010, allowing us to implement a direct marketing strategy with our own sales force in the U.S.In 2009, we introduced our second-generation MRI compatible IV infusion pump system, the MRidium 3860+ which improved upon the previous 3850 version in several areas, including the addition of SpO2 monitoring, and remote wireless monitoring capability. An SpO2 monitor can signal when an insufficient level of oxygen is being supplied to the body. Our MRidium 3860+ is the only MRI compatible IV infusion pump system on the market today.In 2014, we began developing our own MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system (“3880 Monitor”). Using current and new technologies, and our trade secrets, we believe our 3880 Monitor improves on the design of competitive MRI compatible vital signs monitors. Our 3880 Monitor is compact and lightweight, overcoming many of the workflow issues created by other larger and heavier MRI compatible monitors currently in the market. In December 2016, we made our first shipments of the 3880 Monitor to international customers. In October 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for our 3880 Monitor and immediately began our direct selling efforts in the United States.In 2022, we introduced our ferromagnetic detection device, IRadimed FMD1 3600 with Remote Alarm Logging Unit, (“RALU”). This is the first ferromagnetic detection device with TruSenseTM threat qualification technology for MRI safety strategy in hospitals. This technology predicts an approaching ferrous hazard by uniquely 2

MRI is generally considered safer than other scanning techniques that expose the body to radiation. This is particularly true for children. As such, practitioners at hospitals and other medical facilities have been increasingly developing and using MRI for new procedures. These procedures include cardiac stress testing, intraoperative MRI and neurology MRI techniques. Our MRI compatible products offer a way to continuously deliver essential IV fluids safely and accurately while also monitoring the vital signs of critically ill or sedated patients, thereby allowing the expanded use of MRI procedures, better or quicker diagnoses and treatments that may lead to shorter hospital stays resulting in lower health care costs.While the benefits and uses of interventional magnetic resonance (“MR”) are known, there are hazards intrinsic to the MR environment which must be respected. These hazards may be attributed to a powerful static magnetic field, pulsed gradient magnetic fields, and pulsed radio frequency fields. The MRI suite is a harsh place for medical devices, and safe and proper patient care requires specialty equipment that is specifically designed and built for the MR environment. Many of the dangers and problems present in the MR environment can be solved through use of non-magnetic equipment that have operational safeguards and that maintain performance standards within a harsh magnetic environment while simultaneously maintaining patient safety. Designing MRI compatible medical devices that operate safely and effectively in the MR environment requires overcoming significant technical hurdles.Intravenous fluids and vital signs monitoring are needed during MRI procedures for many different reasons. Infusion pumps provide sedation to patients who are not able to remain immobile during an MRI scan and to deliver a continuous flow of critical medications to seriously ill patients, including those from critical care departments. Given the benefits to patient safety, radiology departments performing the scan, anesthesia departments delivering sedation and critical care specialists responsible for delivering critical medications during MRI procedures often initiate requests for an MRI compatible IV infusion pump. Additionally, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations requires monitoring of a patient’s vital signs while under sedation. Further, vital signs monitoring is also required when the patient’s condition prevents them from alerting clinicians when experiencing pain, respiratory problems, cardiac distress or other difficulties that may arise during an MRI scan.Standard Infusion Pumps and Other Inadequate AlternativesFor those medical facilities that do not currently own an MRI compatible IV infusion pump, there are five general methods that are used to deal with patients that are candidates for an MRI requiring IV medications or sedation during their imaging procedure: (1) do not offer MRI treatment to such patients; (2) use standard (magnetic) pumps with long IV lines that extend outside the MRI scanner room; (3) proceed and accept patients for an MRI procedure, but stop the flow of IV fluids during the procedure; (4) allow the gravity controlled free drip of IV fluids; and (5) attempt to shield a conventional IV infusion pump. All these approaches have drawbacks, introduce safety risks and may result in patient harm.Use of multiple lengths of extension tubing can cause infusion inaccuracies, unnecessary waste of costly medications and false alarms or, more seriously, delayed alarms for equipment issues such as occlusion, especially when low flow rates are being used. Such makeshift extension sets can also affect the effectiveness of fluid delivery. A clinician’s adjustment of dosage and other settings may take longer to reach the patient due to the over-extended tubing.Further, there are risks in using a standard IV infusion pump that is mistakenly believed to be at a safe distance from the MR scanner. The powerful magnetic fields may cause metal objects in the MR environment to be drawn with 3
Table of Contentsgreat force into the bore of the MRI system, resulting in potentially deadly projectiles. Moreover, an MRI scanner’s gradient magnetic field and radiofrequency (“RF”) fields can send electrical currents through cables and other conductive materials that are near the MRI system and cause the cables to heat, which may result in burns if they come into contact with the patient or facility staff.Other problems include devices malfunctioning if they are not properly designed for use in the harsh MR environment and low-quality MR images due to artifacts caused by RF interference emitted from ancillary equipment.To deal with the harsh environment of MR, some manufacturers have offered a “shielded box” solution (also known as a “Faraday cage”) for use with their standard IV pumps, but the approach has not been widely accepted by customers. The major problem with this approach is that a highly magnetic standard IV infusion pump is still being introduced into a hazardous MRI environment, which can lead to projectile accidents. Additionally, placing a highly magnetic standard IV infusion pump inside a shielded box hinders an operator’s ability to determine the pump’s status and creates inefficiencies when addressing an alarm or revising a pump’s flow rate. Moreover, a Faraday cage with a standard IV infusion pump must be kept approximately 5 to 10 feet from the scanner, which may result in the use of long IV lines. By contrast, our MRI compatible IV infusion pump system can be safely placed and operated anywhere in the scanner room including next to the scanner.We believe that our MRidium MRI compatible IV infusion pump system is the first and only product to provide an easy-to-operate, non-magnetic, safe and RF-quiet solution.Market OpportunitiesAddressable MarketMRI Compatible IV Infusion PumpWe view our MRI compatible IV infusion pump primarily as a patient and staff safety device. Accordingly, we do not actively market our IV infusion pump system in countries that we believe do not have a minimum level of patient safety standards to warrant a device like ours. We estimate there is the potential for the sale of approximately 27,350 MRI compatible IV infusion pump systems based on the number of MRI scanners installed globally in acute care facilities of sufficient sophistication as to be considered supporting favorable market conditions for utilization of our MRI compatible IV infusion pump system. Additionally, based on historical sales data and customer purchasing behaviors, we believe, that with our direct U.S. sales team, there is potential for sales of our MRI compatible IV infusion pump system within critical care departments of U.S. hospitals (refer to the section below titled “Expansion of Intra-Hospital Use of MRI Compatible Devices”). Based on an estimate of the number of critical care departments in the U.S., we believe there is the potential for growth in sales of our MRI compatible IV infusion pump systems. MRI Compatible Patient Vital Signs MonitorThe market for MRI compatible multi-parameter vital signs monitors is well-developed and more subject to replacement cycles than new adoptions. As with our MRI compatible IV infusion pump, we also consider our MRI compatible multi-parameter vital signs monitor primarily as a patient safety device. Accordingly, we do not actively market our MRI vital signs monitor in countries that we believe do not have a minimum level of patient safety standards to warrant a device like ours. We estimate there is the potential for the sale of approximately 27,350 MRI vital signs monitoring systems based on the number of MRI scanners installed globally in acute care facilities of sufficient sophistication as to be considered supporting favorable market conditions for utilization of our MRI vital signs monitoring system. Additionally, based on historical sales data and customer purchasing behaviors, we believe, that with our direct U.S. sales team, there is potential for sales of our MRI vital signs monitoring system within critical care departments of U.S. hospitals (refer to the section below titled “Expansion of Intra-Hospital Use of MRI Compatible Devices”). Based on an estimate the number of critical care departments in the U.S. and an estimate of the anticipated adoption rate in these critical care departments, we believe there is potential for growth in sales of our MRI vital signs monitoring systems. 4
Table of ContentsExpansion of Intra-Hospital Use of MRI Compatible DevicesHistorically, we marketed our MRI compatible devices primarily to the MRI departments of U.S. hospitals. We believe, however, based on feedback and historical successes selling our devices, that there is potential for expanded deployment of our MRI compatible IV infusion pumps and MRI compatible monitors within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Emergency Room (ER), and other critical care departments within U.S. hospitals where there is a high probability that MRI procedures will need to be performed on these patients. These additional call points within the critical care areas of a hospital often result in additional sales into radiology. Additionally, expanded use of our MRI compatible medical devices could serve as a type of transport package and allow for consistent and uninterrupted administration of IV fluids and monitoring of vital signs, allowing for easier and safer intra-hospital transport of patients to and from the MRI scanner.It is often necessary for a patient in a critical care department of the hospital who is connected to a standard vital signs monitor and a standard IV infusion pump that is delivering critical medications to be quickly moved to the MRI facility for immediate imaging. The presence of our MRI compatible medical devices in those critical care departments enables the orderly and rapid transfer between those standard medical devices to our 3880 Monitor and MRidium MRI compatible IV infusion pump in the critical care department prior to transporting the patient for an MRI. Seriously ill patients are generally at higher risk when they are away from the resources of critical care departments, and efficient transfers to MRI compatible devices while the patient is in the critical care environment minimizes the time the patient spends away from the critical care department.We believe there is a higher occurrence of equipment-related adverse events during the intra-hospital transport of critically ill patients. We therefore believe that placing our MRI compatible devices in critical care departments could reduce patient adverse events associated with vital signs monitors and IV pump transfers typically performed within MRI departments.Some hospitals use MRI during surgical procedures. Neurosurgical interventions have been at the forefront of this development in image-guided surgery, followed by otolaryngological procedures. As MR-guided intervention during surgery has been deployed, the degree of complexity in supplemental devices has increased markedly potentially introducing additional safety issues for patients. Much of the effort required for successful implementation of intraoperative MRI has been in development and testing of anesthesia equipment, patient monitoring devices, infusion pumps and surgical instruments and accessories, all of which need to be MRI compatible if used near the MRI scanner. Intraoperative MRI is expanding demand for our MRI compatible devices from the MRI suite to the surgical suite of the hospital.StrategyCompany ObjectiveOur objective is to be the leader in providing safe and effective care for all patients undergoing MRI procedures through the development and commercialization of a portfolio of MRI compatible products, accessories, disposables, and related services. By increasing the safety parameters of equipment operating within the harsh magnetic environment of the MRI scanner room, we hope to enable hospitals and other healthcare providers to offer the MRI diagnostic procedures patients require. We believe our current products increase the safety of performing MRI diagnostics for patients by minimizing potential complications with IV infusions, vital signs monitoring, and detection of metals possessing ferromagnetism.We seek to grow our business by, among other things:Driving market awareness of our MRI compatible IV infusion pump and the safety risks associated with using conventional IV pumps with long IV lines.We believe that the largest potential market for our MRI compatible IV infusion pumps is the segment of the market that is currently using workaround solutions. Such solutions include using conventional pumps outside the MRI 5
Table of Contentsscanner room and attaching multiple extension lines of IV tubing sets through the wall or under the door into the MRI scanner room to reach the patient. This practice of makeshift setups is fraught with risks to the patient and unnecessary costs and inefficiencies. These risks and inefficiencies include:●Infection risk from running lengthy IV tubing sets with multiple extensions through the wall or under the door;●Risk of inaccurate dose delivery from using a conventional IV infusion pump with multiple extension lines;●Potential medication occlusion and lengthy alarm notification delays due to multiple extension lines, posing great risks to patients on critical medications;●Excess medication costs due to the disposal of multiple extension IV tubing sets filled with unused medication at the end of the procedure; and●Lost productivity and MRI scanning time due to the lengthy set up time required for multiple extension lines.We believe that increased market awareness and education will be required for potential customers to appreciate the value for patients and the hospital of an efficient and patient-safe MRI environment, which includes MRI compatible IV infusion pumps.Driving market awareness of our MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring systemWe believe our 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system creates customer value by resolving significant workflow issues through the additional utilization achievable with our MRI monitor that is not possible with other MRI monitors. Our 3880 Monitor’s compact and lightweight design facilitates the use of multiple monitors to support a single MRI scanner as well as the transportation of patients from their critical care unit to the MRI and back, resulting in increased patient safety through uninterrupted vital signs monitoring and decreasing the amount of time critically ill patients are away from critical care units. Because of the transport capabilities that only our small-sized 3880 Monitor offers, we believe multiple departments within a hospital will be interested in purchasing our device. Other MRI monitors are too large and heavy for use in patient transport scenarios are therefore typically only located in the MRI departments of hospitals.Continuing to innovate with MRI compatible patient care products.Our management team has a significant amount of experience developing and commercializing MRI compatible products. We have entrenched relationships with several of the industry’s top thought leaders and we have, and will continue to, closely collaborate with them to build upon IRADIMED’s innovative MRI compatible technologies. We intend to leverage this experience and collaboration to innovate and commercialize other technologically advanced MRI compatible patient care products. Our 2022 introduction of our Ferromagnetic Detection system (“FMD”) is an example of this expansion.When reasonably available, acquiring synergistic MRI patient care companies, products, or technology licenses to accelerate our product development and leverage our existing sales organization.We have an experienced team of engineering and operations managers committed to improving on existing MRI patient care designs through our internal development efforts and the possible acquisition of technologies and intellectual property of others. We have a direct sales organization in the U.S. and a team of experienced international distributors that we believe can effectively go to market with additional MRI compatible patient care products. While we have not completed an acquisition, we evaluate such opportunities from time to time that might improve our value to customers via a larger product offering.6
Table of ContentsCommercial StrategyWe believe that the MRI compatible IV infusion pump market continues to have growth potential and we continue to drive increased awareness, adoption and utilization of our MRI compatible products by:Continued development of our MRI-focused U.S. direct sales force and our international sales effortsWe believe the most meaningful aspect of our commercialization strategy in the U.S. is the continued development of the market through driving awareness and education by our direct sales force. Since there is no current direct competitor for an MRI compatible IV infusion pump, our focus is on expanding the market through better education on the advantages to patients, clinicians and hospitals of our current and expected infusion pump solutions and the shortcomings of current workaround practices. Additionally, with our 3880 Monitor, we focus on educating customers on the total workflow benefits our devices offer and how our devices increase the efficiency of MRI scanners via patient throughput.As business progress dictates, we intend to add to our specialized, MRI product-focused direct sales team, including our supporting clinical application specialists. We believe that we can significantly increase sales of our MRI compatible medical devices by continuing to call on critical care departments, which may help influence hospitals’ purchasing decisions. We believe that this strategy is likely expanding the number of acute care facilities using our MRI compatible products and increasing the average number of MRI compatible IV infusion pumps and monitors per MRI scanner.Internationally, our focus is to continue working with our distributors in key target markets, such as Europe and Asia, to expand the business and augment our market penetration rates. As business progress dictates, we plan to expand our staff to serve the largest potential markets outside the U.S. to build our relationships at the local level.Supporting commercial efforts with evidence-based informationWe focus our sales team on educating customers on the safety and efficiency benefits of using our MRI compatible products. To assist in the education process, we have developed materials that document the risks and additional costs associated with using a workaround solution of running long lines from conventional IV pumps outside the MRI scanner room. We are also continuing the development of and enhancing our materials documenting the benefits of patient-centered care with uninterrupted vital signs monitoring that allows for easy transfer of critically ill patients from critical care to the MRI scanner room and back. We believe this kind of evidence-based documentation will help us provide widespread education to the clinicians that are driving clinical practice. We also believe that documented evidence will serve to inform the quality and risk management leaders in these organizations, which in turn may help drive the overall adoption of our MRI compatible products.Providing best in class customer service and user experienceWe believe that the expectations of our customers for service and a superior user experience have risen with the advancement of technology. Once a customer purchases our products, it is imperative that they receive first-class clinical education and support to encourage usage of our products. We devote a significant amount of time and training to ensure that this educational experience is a success. This training is usually performed by our sales staff with the frequent assistance of our clinical application specialists. We intend to hire more clinical application specialists to strengthen our initial training experience and increase ongoing customer support. We believe that a positive user experience is critical to driving increased rates of utilization of our products which can increase sales of disposables.Our ProductsTypical MRI Scanner RoomThe following diagram is representation of an aerial view of a typical MRI scanner room with a typical three Tesla magnet.

Our MRidium 3860+ MRI compatible IV infusion pump system offers a dose rate calculator, bolus dose programming, full alarm settings, and a rechargeable battery with a 12-hour life.MRidium 3860+ IV Tubing Sets - DisposablesThe MRidium 3860+ MRI compatible IV infusion pump system utilizes proprietary fluid delivery tubing sets, each known as an “IV tubing set.” Each use of our MRI compatible IV infusion pump requires a disposable IV tubing set. We offer a variety of IV tubing sets for varying infusion scenarios and these include our standard “spike” infusion set, syringe adapter infusion set and extension infusion set. Each of our IV tubing sets is latex-free and Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)-free.●MRidium 1056 Standard Infusion Set. Our standard “spike” infusion set features the ability to accurately deliver liquids from either a bottle or IV bag. The 1056 standard infusion set contains two needle-free injection ports and is typically used when starting a new infusion from a bottle or bag.●MRidium 1057 Syringe Adapter Infusion Set. Our syringe adapter IV set enables users to provide accurate delivery of IV fluids directly from standard syringes. The 1057 vented syringe adapter set benefits from a low priming volume of 4 ml, which minimizes inefficient waste of medication. This product is most commonly used for cardiac medications, anesthesia, and pediatric drug delivery.9
Table of Contents●MRidium 1058 Extension Infusion Set. Our extension infusion set allows users to transfer a patient on a standard infusion pump to our MRI compatible IV infusion pump. The user simply disconnects the existing IV tubing at the patient site and primes and connects the MRidium extension set to the existing IV tubing. Once removed from the conventional infusion pump and connected to our MRidium MRI compatible IV infusion pump, the user can program the pump and begin the infusion. The 1058 extension set includes one needle-free injection port and is typically used to provide uninterrupted critical medications to a severely ill patient during an MRI procedure.MR IV PoleWe offer a fully functional and weighted non-magnetic IV pole that is designed for mobility within the hospital and the MRI scanner room. The IV pole can support two MRidium 3860+ MRI compatible IV infusion pumps, each with a 3861 Side Car Pump Module. The IV pole is 66 inches (1.68 meters) high, stabilized with a wide pole radius and mobilized with five casters designed to roll easily during transport. The IV pole is equipped with four hooks for holding fluid bags.Optional FeaturesOur 3860+ MRI compatible IV infusion pump system gives customers the ability to adapt their systems to meet their specific needs.

We also offer rechargeable lithium polymer battery packs which have a 12-hour life when not connected to an electrical outlet.3861 Side Car Pump ModuleOur Side Car Pump Module can be attached to our 3860+ MRidium MRI compatible IV infusion pump to provide a second channel for infusion delivery. This flexible option allows hospitals to convert their single-channel infusion pump into a dual-channel system designed to deliver both large and small volume fluids in the MRI scanner room. The side car is fully functional with our 3865 MRidium Wireless Remote, allowing clinicians the ability to control both channels with one remote control unit outside of the MRI scanner room. The additional delivery line has all of the same features and benefits as the 3860+ MRidium MRI compatible IV infusion pump, as described above.3865 MRidium Wireless Remote Display/ControlOur wireless remote display/control unit allows for complete control and monitoring of the MRidium MRI compatible IV infusion pump system from the control room (outside of the MRI scanner room). The 3865 MRidium Wireless Remote relays all commands via a single channel and displays information bi-directionally between the MRI compatible IV infusion pump and the remote display/control unit. Utilizing the same user interface and large bright display as the MRidium pump, our wireless remote display/control unit permits clinicians to adjust all pump parameters, including SpO2 monitoring parameters, rates, dose, volume, pump run/stop, alarms (adjust or reset), as well as real-time titration. Our remote display/control unit utilizes a proven MRI compatible 2.4 GHz frequency hopping spread spectrum radio technology for artifact-free operation that does not disturb the MRI imaging process. Clinicians may also use the remote display/control unit to adjust a second pump channel when used in combination with our Side Car unit discussed above. Our 3865 MRidium Wireless Remote also functions as a battery charger for our MRidium battery pack.Dose Error Reduction System (DERS)Our DERS software for use with our MRidium 3860+ MRI compatible IV infusion pump system incorporates the latest dosing safety features for patients. The DERS system enables users to create a unique drug library and establish nominal values and limits for dose and concentration for specified infusion protocols. With DERS, patient safety and user convenience are supported by user-programmed infusion hard limits (maximum and minimum) and soft limits (high and low limits that require user confirmation to exceed). The dose applied via DERS is displayed and can be 10

Our international distributors are managed by our international sales team.The percentage of total revenue generated by geographic region was as follows:​​​​​​​    Percent of Revenue ​​Year Ended December 31,  ​​2024    2023 United States  83%   80%International  17%   20%​The percentage of total revenue generated by product type was as follows:​​​​​​​​Percent of Revenue ​​Year Ended December 31,  ​​2024​2023 Devices     71%   70%Disposable, service and other  26%   27%Amortization of extended warranty agreements  3%   3%​Selling cycles for our devices have varied widely and have historically ranged between three and six months in duration.The principal customers for our MRI compatible products include hospitals and acute care facilities. The key decision maker in a purchase varies on the hospital department making the purchase. We serve these customers through our sales and service specialists and believe that our specialists are well-positioned to build upon these customer relationships. We communicate with our customers on a regular basis to understand potential issues or concerns as well as to improve our products and services in response to their needs. Product orders and inquiries are handled by trained service representatives who communicate with customers after equipment shipments, installations, and service repair 12
Table of Contentscalls. We have implemented various other programs which enable us to assess our customers’ needs. These programs include surveys and visits to customer sites.We enter into agreements with Integrated Delivery Networks (“IDNs”) and healthcare supply contracting companies, which are commonly referred to as Group Purchasing Organizations (“GPOs”) in the U.S., which enable us to sell and distribute our products to their member hospitals. GPOs negotiate volume purchase prices for hospitals, group practices, and other clinics that are members of a GPO. Our agreements with GPOs typically include the following provisions:●Negotiated pricing for all group members;●Volume discounts and other preferential terms on member purchases from us;●Promotion of our products by the GPO to its members; and●Payment of administrative fees by us to the GPO, based on purchases of our products by group members.Under our GPO agreements, we are required to pay the GPOs a fee of three percent of the sales of our products to members of the GPO.
Sales to participating IDNs do not have an associated fee.Manufacturing and SuppliersWe assemble our products in our facility in Winter Springs, Florida, from components and sub-assemblies purchased from outside suppliers. We perform final assembly, testing and packaging to control quality and manufacturing efficiency. We purchase components and sub-assemblies from qualified suppliers that are subject to our stringent quality specifications and inspections by us. We conduct quality audits of our key suppliers, several of which are experienced in the supply of components to manufacturers of finished medical devices or disposables for use with these medical devices. Our historical track record of producing MRI compatible products has been good; however, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue or that we will be able to produce sufficient units to reach our expected revenue growth rates.Some of the raw materials and parts that are critical to the production and operation of our products are sourced from single suppliers. Some components we or our suppliers utilize are from Chinese or Taiwanese manufacturers. We have never encountered a significant supply interruption from any sole supplier; however, the operations of our third-party suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business operations or that are beyond our control, including but not limited to the global supply chain issues, international trade restrictions and tariffs, excessive demand creating shortages of available supply, and conditions related to health pandemics. We continuously monitor our supply chain regarding these matters to anticipate and prevent risk of disruption. We typically maintain no less than a three-month supply of raw materials and parts that are sourced from sole suppliers and make efforts to identify additional suppliers who may be able to provide such raw materials or parts. For example, the non-magnetic, ultrasonic motor which drives our MRI compatible IV infusion pump was sole sourced from a major multinational Japanese manufacturing company until December 2024 when the Company in its ordinary course of business entered into a technology transfer and license agreement with the supplier allowing the Company to manufacture its own non-magnetic, ultrasonic motors.We place significant emphasis on providing quality products and services to our customers. Quality management and oversight play an essential role in understanding and meeting customer requirements, effectively resolving quality issues and improving our products and services. We have a network of quality systems throughout our facilities that relate to the design, development, assembly, packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution and labeling of our products.To assess and facilitate compliance with applicable requirements, we periodically review our quality systems to determine their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.13
Table of ContentsWe also conduct compliance training programs for our sales and marketing personnel and perform assessments of our suppliers of raw materials, components and finished goods. In addition, we conduct quality management reviews designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of our products. From time to time, we may determine that products manufactured or marketed by us do not meet our specifications, published standards or regulatory requirements. When a quality issue is identified, we investigate the issue and take appropriate corrective action, such as withdrawal of the product from the market, correction of the product at the customer location, notice to the customer of revised labeling or a combination of these or other corrective actions.In January 2007, we received ISO 13485 certification and met the requirements under the European Medical Device Directive to use the CE Mark, thereby allowing us to continue to market our products in the European Community. In October 2024, we underwent a recertification audit to maintain our ISO 13485:2016 and Medical Device Single Audit Program certifications and received our certificates. These certificates will need renewal again by January 2028.CompetitionThe medical products industry is characterized by intense competition and innovation via extensive research and new product development efforts. The market for medical products is subject to rapid change due to a competitive, cost-conscious environment and to government programs intended to reduce the cost of medical care. Many manufacturers and distributors of medical equipment are large, well-established companies whose resources, reputations, and ability to leverage existing customer relationships might give them a competitive advantage over us. We believe that a company’s reputation for producing accurate, reliable, and technologically advanced products, references from users, features (speed, safety, ease of use, patient convenience and range of applicability), product effectiveness and price are the principal competitive factors in the medical products industry.Our SpO2 products, which measure blood oxygen saturation and included in our MRI compatible IV infusion pump and our MRI compatible vital signs monitor, also compete indirectly with many other methods currently used to measure blood oxygen levels or the effects of low blood oxygen levels.MRidium MRI Compatible IV Infusion Pump SystemWe do not believe there is currently any direct competition for our MRI compatible IV infusion pump system. Historically, our only direct competitor in the MRI compatible IV infusion pump market, Bayer Radiology, formerly MEDRAD, Inc., announced during 2013 its decision to remove its competing Continuum pump system from the market, and discontinued support throughout the world in June 2015 due to ongoing regulatory issues. As a result, we believe that our MRidium 3860+ MRI compatible IV infusion pump is the only true MRI compatible IV infusion pump available today.The medical device and IV infusion market is highly regulated and is typically one of the areas that the FDA scrutinizes closely for new market introductions. Because of this, the FDA 510(k) clearance process for new infusion pumps is usually long and requires significant testing and documentation. This long timeline coupled with the low market penetration to date may discourage new competitors from undertaking a complex project like building an MRI compatible IV infusion pump. We believe that the market for MRI compatible IV infusion pump products is underpenetrated and may become highly competitive if, and when, the market develops further.We also compete with manufacturers of “shielded box” solutions that are intended as “workarounds” to permit use of conventional IV pumps inside the MRI scanner room. The providers of shielded boxes include B. Braun, Fresenius Kabi and MIPM Mammendorfer Institut für Physik und Medizin.Many of our potential customers opt not to purchase our MRI compatible IV infusion pump systems and instead use makeshift workarounds, such as placing conventional IV infusion devices outside of the MRI scanning room and utilizing extension tubing to reach the patient, introducing additional patient safety issues. To this extent, we are in competition with conventional IV infusion pump manufacturers and distributors.14
Table of ContentsThere are many manufacturers of conventional IV infusion pump devices, and if any of these manufacturers, or other potential competitors, decide to enter the MRI compatible IV infusion pump market, they may have competitive advantages over us. Many of these potential competitors have established reputations, customer relationships and marketing, distribution, and service networks. In addition, they have substantially longer histories in the medical products industry, larger product lines and greater financial, technical, manufacturing, management, and research and development resources. Many of these potential competitors may have long-term product supply relationships with our potential customers.MRI Compatible Patient Vital Signs Monitoring SystemThere are several manufacturers that have developed competing MRI compatible vital signs monitoring systems that are currently on the market. We believe the dominant competitor with a market-leading position in MRI compatible vital signs monitoring is Invivo Research, which was founded by Roger Susi, our founder, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board. Invivo Research is now owned by Koninklijke Philips NV (NYSE: PHG).Other large and well-known companies such as GE Healthcare Technologies (Nasdaq: GEHC) and Schiller AG, also have competing products as do other smaller privately held companies. Each of these manufacturers have competitive advantages over us as they may have established customer relationships, product supply agreements, longer histories in the MRI monitoring market and several have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, management, and research and development budgets. Additionally, our 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitor is newer to the market relative to these other companies, which may result in customers being reluctant to switch from other well-known and established MRI compatible monitoring systems to ours.SeasonalityOur business is seasonal. Historically, our third quarter bookings have typically been lower, compared to other fiscal quarters, principally because the fiscal quarter coincides with the summer vacation season in the northern hemisphere.Segment Information and Geographic DataOur business operates as one reportable segment. Financial information about geographic areas is presented in Notes 2 and 4 in the Notes to Financial Statements of this Annual Report.Research and DevelopmentOur research and development efforts focus on developing innovative products by utilizing our established core competencies in MRI compatible technologies and feedback from strategic relationships with hospitals, acute medical facilities and medical equipment manufacturers for new product ideas. Our research and development efforts are driven by the leadership of our founder, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board, Roger Susi, along with engineers and technical professionals with significant experience in systems engineering and product design.Our research and development expenses remain consistent at $2.8 million or 3.9 percent of revenue in 2024 and $2.9 million or 4.4 percent of revenue in 2023.Human CapitalAs of December 31, 2024, we had 160 full-time employees, including 59 in manufacturing and service, 57 in sales, marketing and customer support services, 15 in regulatory affairs and quality assurance, 13 in finance and administration and 16 in research and development. No employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good. We endeavor to maintain a workplace that is free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable 15
Table of Contentslaw. We conduct annual training to reduce risks of harassment and discrimination and monitor employee conduct year-round, including by providing employees with access to an anonymous whistleblower hotline to report any allegations. The basis for recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation, and advancement at the Company is qualifications, performance, skills and experience. Our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to gender, race and ethnicity, and routinely recognized for outstanding performance and provided with training and professional development opportunities.Regulatory MattersGovernmental Regulation and Other MattersOur medical device products are subject to extensive, complex and increasing oversight and regulation by the FDA, and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities. Our manufacturing facility, and those of our suppliers, are subject to periodic inspections to verify compliance with current FDA and other governmental regulatory requirements. If it were determined that we were not in compliance with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to criminal or civil liability, or both, and other material adverse effects. We have compliance programs in place to support and monitor compliance with these laws and regulations. All our products and facilities and those of our suppliers are subject to drug and medical device laws and regulations promulgated by the FDA and national and supranational regulatory authorities outside the U.S., including, for example, Health Canada’s Health Products and Foods Branch, the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, and Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Agency. These authorities regulate a range of activities including, among other matters, manufacturing, post-marketing studies in humans, advertising and promotion, product labeling, post-marketing surveillance and adverse event reporting.Regulation of Medical Devices in the United StatesThe development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our medical device products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation. Most notably, all our medical devices sold in the United States are subject to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended (“FDC Act”), as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA, and in some cases other government agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), administer requirements covering the design, testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and advertising, distribution, and post-market surveillance of our products.Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market must first receive either premarket notification clearance (by making what is commonly called “a 510(k) submission”) or premarket approval (by filing a premarket approval application (“PMA”) from the FDA pursuant to the FDC Act). In addition, certain modifications made to marketed devices also may require 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA supplement. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process varies in length and can extend beyond twelve months. The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy, and uncertain than the 510(k) process. It generally takes from two to three years or even longer. All our current regulated medical devices and related products that are available in the U.S. were originally cleared through the 510(k) process as required by the FDA. We cannot be sure that future medical devices or modifications of current medical devices will qualify for the 510(k) pathway or whether PMA approval will be required for any future product that we propose to market. An exception is our FMD1, which does not fall under FDA regulation as it does not meet the definition of a medical device per section 201 (h) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.In December 2014, the FDA issued guidance entitled “Infusion Pumps Total Product Life Cycle.” This guidance established substantial additional pre-market requirements for new and modified infusion pumps. Through this guidance, the FDA required more data needed to demonstrate product safety for future 510(k) submissions for infusion pumps, including the potential for more clinical and human factors data. The impact of this guidance is likely to result in a more time consuming and costly process to obtain regulatory clearance to market infusion pumps. In addition, new requirements beyond the 2014 guidance document could result in longer delays for the clearance of new products, modification of existing infusion pump products or remediation of existing products in the market. Future delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals could result in delayed or no realization of attendant product revenues.16
Table of ContentsAfter a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. Those regulatory requirements include the following: product listing and establishment registration; adherence to the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which requires stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures; labeling requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of off-label uses or indications; adverse event reporting; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; post-market surveillance requirements; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask for, or require, the recall of products from the market; and requirements relating to voluntary corrections or removals.All aspects of our manufacturing and distribution of regulated products and those of our suppliers are subject to substantial governmental oversight. Facilities used for the production, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution of medical devices must be registered with the FDA and other regulatory authorities. All manufacturing activities for these products must be conducted in compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”). Our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers are subject to periodic, routine and for-cause inspections to verify compliance with cGMPs. If, upon inspection, the FDA or another regulatory agency finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply with cGMPs, it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions, such as product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions to halt manufacturing and distributing products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal to grant clearances or approvals or delays in granting such clearances or approvals, import detentions of products made outside of the United States, restrictions on operations or withdrawal or suspension of existing approvals. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to our business practices and operations; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while we or our suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Product RecallsWe have made substantial investments in quality systems and we will continue to make improvements to our products and systems to further reduce potential issues related to patient safety and avoid recalls in the future. Product quality plays a critical role in our success. While we believe that we have made significant improvements to our product quality and overall quality systems, quality concerns, whether real or perceived, could adversely affect our results. Conversely, improving quality can be a competitive advantage and improve our results. For more information about risks related to these matters, see the section captioned “Defects or failures associated with our products and/or our quality control systems could lead to the filing of adverse event reports, recalls or safety alerts and negative publicity and could subject us to regulatory actions” in the “Risk Factors” section.Healthcare Fraud and Abuse LawsAs a manufacturer and distributor of medical devices to hospitals and other healthcare providers, we and our customers are subject to laws which apply to Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs in the U.S. One such law, the Anti-kickback Statute, prohibits the solicitation, offer, payment or receipt of remuneration in return for referral or purchase, or in return for the recommending or arranging for the referral or purchase, of products covered by the programs. The Anti-kickback Statute provides several exceptions or “safe harbors” for particular types of transactions. While we do not file claims for reimbursement from government payers, the U.S. federal government has asserted theories of liability against manufacturers under the Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and other state and federal programs. Many states have similar fraud and abuse laws which may apply to us. Violations of these fraud and abuse-related laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and health programs outside the United States. We have developed and implemented business practices and processes to train our personnel to perform their duties in compliance with healthcare fraud and abuse laws. While we conduct informal oversight to detect and prevent these types of fraud and abuse, we lack formal written policies and procedures at this time. If we were unable to document and implement the controls and procedures required in a timely manner or otherwise violate such laws, we might suffer adverse regulatory consequences or face criminal sanctions, which could harm our operations, financial reporting, or financial results.17
Table of ContentsRegulation of Medical Devices Outside of the United StatesMedical device laws also are in effect in many of the non-U.S. markets in which we do business. These laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all our products to requests for product data or certifications. Inspection of and controls over manufacturing, as well as monitoring of device-related adverse events, also are components of most of these regulatory systems. Most of our business is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation balanced with a goal of optimizing international harmonization. For example, the European Union (“EU”), which currently relies on independent third parties, (called “Notified Bodies”) rather than governmental authorities to review and certify medium and high-risk medical devices, is moving to more governmental oversight of medical devices. Currently, the regulatory requirements for a broad spectrum of medical devices are covered in three European Medical Device Directives (adopted in the 1990’s) with which manufacturers must comply in order to receive a CE Certificate of Conformity (“CE Mark”) from a Notified Body. Only certified medical devices bearing a CE Mark can be sold in the EU and European Free Trade Association (“EFTA”) countries and Türkiye. EFTA includes Iceland, Norway, Principality of Liechtenstein and Switzerland.In May 2017, the EU implemented a new regulatory scheme for medical devices under the Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”). The MDR initially became effective in May 2021, however the MDR transition was recently extended to 2028 for Class IIb non-implanted devices. Regardless our CE Certificates remain valid through December 2028, allowing us to continue shipping our products into the EU. MDR brings significant new requirements for many medical devices, including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation, increased focus on device identification and traceability, new definitions, and registration of economic operators throughout the distribution chain, and additional post-market surveillance and vigilance. Compliance with the MDR will require re-certification of our products to the enhanced standards and may result in substantial additional expense. If these measures are unable to be taken, it may no longer be possible to place such devices on the EU market. Additionally, we may lose our current quality system certification due to ISO Registrar difficulties as European authorities increase regulatory pressure or increased scrutiny resulting from MDR. The loss of the quality system certification may prevent product shipments to the EU and to other foreign markets, such as Canada, which could significantly lower our revenues from foreign sales while we take remedial measures.The EU has enacted legislation restricting the use of hazardous substances in electronic equipment (Directive 2011/65/EU, referred to as “RoHS 2”), such as our devices. The application of RoHS 2 to medical devices became effective as of July 22, 2014. Our products are compliant with RoHS 2. If we are unable to remain compliant with RoHS 2, there may be an interruption of sales to the EU, which could significantly lower our revenues from foreign sales while we take remedial measures.Anti-Bribery LawsOur global activities are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other countries’ anti-bribery laws that have been enacted in support of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Anti-bribery Convention. These laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials with the intent to inappropriately gain a business advantage. They also require companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal financial controls. The U.K. Bribery Act also prohibits commercial bribery and makes it a crime for a company to fail to prevent bribery. Companies have the burden of proving that they have adequate procedures in place to prevent bribery. The enforcement of such laws in the U.S. and elsewhere has increased dramatically in the past few years, and authorities have indicated that the pharmaceutical and medical device industry is a significant focus for enforcement efforts.Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities. Our policies mandate strict compliance with the anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.18
Table of ContentsTransparency Laws in the U.S. and Other CountriesThere are numerous requirements imposed by states in the U.S. on the interaction of pharmaceutical and medical device companies with physicians. For example, several states and the District of Columbia either require the tracking and reporting of specific types of interactions with healthcare professionals or restrict such interactions. A similar requirement was imposed at the federal level under the “sunshine” provision of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to track and report payments and “transfers of value” to U.S. physicians or teaching hospitals by manufacturers of medical products that are available for reimbursement by a federal insurer.Other LawsWe are also subject to a variety of other laws, directives, and regulations in and outside of the U.S., including those related to the following:●environmental laws and regulations;●the safety and health laws of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, which sets forth requirements for workplace conditions;●California’s Proposition 65, which sets forth a list of substances that are deemed by the State of California to pose a risk of carcinogenicity or birth defects; and●various customs, export control, anti-boycott and trade embargo laws and regulations administered by U.S. and foreign government agencies, including the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Department of Commerce and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Treasury Department, as well as others.Despite our training and compliance program, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents in violation of any of these laws.Available InformationOur principal executive office is located at 1025 Willa Springs Drive, Winter Springs, Florida 32708.

RISK FACTORSWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves many risks that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, and some of which are beyond our control. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. In evaluating the Company and its business, you should carefully consider the information included under Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report. Risk Factors SummaryThe following is a summary of the risk factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results, all of which are more fully described below. This summary should be read in conjunction with the “Risk Factors” described below and should not be relied upon as a complete summary of the material risks facing our business.Risks Relating to Our Business and Financial Condition●Our dependence on a limited number of products, and disruptions in our ability to sell these products.●Dependence upon the integrity of our supply chain and third-party suppliers for certain raw materials and components.●Failure to protect our information technology infrastructure which could adversely affect our business and operating results.●The strict adherence to regulatory requirements governing medical devices during the manufacturing process and that of suppliers.●Our markets are very competitive, and we sell certain of our products in a mature market.●We manufacture and store our products at a single facility in Florida.●Failure to maintain relationships with IDNs and GPOs.●The lengthy sales cycle for medical devices could delay our sales.●Our reliance on distributors to sell our products outside the U.S.●Successful development and commercialization of enhanced or new products to remain competitive.●Our dependency on our founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Roger Susi.●Inability to scale our operations or adequately manage generational upgrades to our own products.●Our engagement in related party transactions.●Difficulties associated with accurately forecasting our business performance.●Inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).●Changes in effective tax rates or results from examination of income or other tax returns.20
Table of Contents●The development and increased use of Artificial Intelligence presents operational risks and challenges that could damage our reputation or materially harm our business.​Risks Related to Our Industry●Changes in government regulations or U.S. healthcare policy could force us to make modifications to how we develop, manufacture, market, and price our products which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.●Failure to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or other necessary approvals to commercially distribute new products.●Risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S.●We may incur product liability losses or become subject to other lawsuits related to our products, business, and insurance coverage could be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses.●Our products or product types, or MR imaging could be subject to negative publicity.●Healthcare fraud and abuse regulations could potentially result in significant liability, require us to change our business practices and/or restrict our operations in the future.●Impact of violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.●We and our suppliers and customers are required to obtain regulatory approvals and maintain compliance with regulations applicable to medical devices and infusion pumps.Risks Relating to our Intellectual Property●Protection of confidential intellectual property, unpatented trade secrets, and proprietary technology.●Uncertainties associated with timely patent reviews and approvals.●We may become involved in patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings relating to our current and future products.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock●Significant fluctuations and volatility of our common stock●Use of capital to repurchase shares of our common stock, need or choice to raise additional capital in the future, payment of dividends, or reduction or cessation of expected dividends.●The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified Board members.●The ability of Roger Susi, who serves as our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, to exert significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval due to his significant minority ownership.●Impact of being a public company on our competitive environment and our risk of potential litigation or involvement in securities class action litigation, if any.21
Table of Contents●Impact of securities or industry analysts’ failing to initiate research coverage of our stock, downgrading our stock, or discontinuing coverage.●Our charter documents and Delaware law have provisions that may discourage an acquisition of us by others and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.Risks Relating to Our Business and Financial ConditionOur financial performance is significantly dependent on a limited number of products, and disruptions in our ability to sell these products may have a material adverse effect on our business.Our current revenue and profitability are significantly dependent on the sale of the MRidium 3860+ MRI compatible IV infusion pump system, the 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system (both Class II medical devices) and the ongoing sale of related disposables and services.There can be no guarantee that in the future, the FDA will not impact our ability to commercially distribute. The FDA could require us to cease shipment of our products, notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risk or substantial harm to public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of the devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban the medical devices. The FDA may also issue warning letters or untitled letters, refuse future requests for 510(k) submission or premarket approval, revoke existing 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals previously granted, impose operating restrictions, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us.As inflationary measures have affected the greater market in the last several years, we have considered the effects of inflation on our business operations and financial results. We have assessed that inflation has not had a material impact on our revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, or cash flows for the current reporting period. We have also evaluated our exposure to future inflationary risk and concluded that it is not significant based on our current business model and market conditions. We have mitigated the impact of inflation on our cost of goods sold by continued operational efficiency.Our products could be rendered obsolete or economically impractical by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to:●entrance of new competitors into our markets;●technological advancements of MRI scanners;●technological developments such as new imaging modalities which render MRI procedures obsolete or reduce the instances where MRI imaging is utilized;●loss of key relationships with suppliers, IDNs, GPOs, distributors, or direct end-user customers;●manufacturing or supply interruptions;●product liability claims;●our reputation and product market acceptance;●loss of existing regulatory approvals or the imposition of new requirements to maintain such approvals; and●product recalls or safety alerts.Any major factor adversely affecting the sale of our products or services would cause our revenues to decline and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and our common stock.22
Table of ContentsOur continued success depends on the integrity of our supply chain and unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials and components, the disruption of which could negatively impact our business.Many of the component parts of our products are obtained through supply agreements with unaffiliated third parties. Some of these parts require our partners to engage in complex manufacturing processes and involve long lead times or delivery periods. Considering our dependence on third-party suppliers, several of which are single-source suppliers, we are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks related to their ability to produce or deliver parts on a timely basis, to comply with product safety and other regulatory requirements and to provide quality parts to us at a reasonable price.In the near term, we do not anticipate finding alternative sources for our primary suppliers. Therefore, if our primary suppliers become unable or unwilling to manufacture or deliver materials, or manufacture or deliver such materials later than anticipated, we could experience protracted delays or interruptions in the supply of materials which would ultimately delay our manufacture of products for commercial sale, which could materially and adversely affect our development programs, commercial activities, operating results, and financial condition.Certain raw materials and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until an appropriate application amendment is approved by the regulatory agency.If our material suppliers are unable or fail to fulfill their obligations to us for any reason, we may not be able to manufacture our products and satisfy customer demand or our obligations under sales agreements in a timely manner, and our business could be harmed as a result. Additionally, any failure by us to forecast demand for, or to maintain an adequate supply of raw materials, parts, or finished products, could result in an interruption in the supply of certain products and a decline in our sales.Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials and components include, but are not limited to:●a supplier’s inability or unwillingness to continue supplying raw materials and/or components;●regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others, including changes in international trade treaties and/or tariffs;●adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy;●unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials or components;●failure of the supplier to comply with quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall;●discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials or components;●labor disputes or shortages, including from natural disasters and the effects of health emergencies or pandemics; and●political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts.These events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our products’ use and sales and our business and results of operations. We may experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products.23
Table of ContentsA cyber security incident or failure to protect our information technology infrastructure could be disruptive to our business, compromise confidential data, cause reputation harm, adversely affect our business and operating results, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries.​We collect and store sensitive business and other information, including intellectual property and trade secrets, on our networks. Our business operations are dependent upon the secure maintenance of this information. Despite the implementation of security measures, our information technology systems and those of our vendors and customers are vulnerable to attack and damage from computer viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, or other harm, including from threat actors seeking to cause disruption to our business. We face risks related to the protection of information that we maintain - or engage a third-party to maintain on our behalf - including unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, or modification of such information. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication, and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyberattacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Beyond external criminal activity, systems that access or control access to our services and databases may be compromised as a result of human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. A material cyberattack or security incident could cause interruptions in our operations and could also damage our reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.If threat actors are able to circumvent or breach our security systems, they could steal any information located therein or cause serious and potentially long-lasting disruption to our operations. Security breaches or attempts thereof could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of litigation, sanctions, and/or monetary loss. We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties that conduct business with us or our customers and others who interact with our data. While we maintain insurance that covers certain security incidents, we may not carry appropriate insurance or maintain sufficient coverage to compensate for damage from all events and related potential liability.We are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security, such as federal and state data protection regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended, and European data privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation. Complying with these numerous and complex regulations is expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with these regulations could result in regulatory scrutiny, civil liability and related fines, or damage to our reputation. In addition, any security breach or attempt thereof could result in liability for stolen assets or information, additional costs associated with repairing any system damage, incentives offered to clients or other business partners to maintain business relationships after a breach, and implementation of measures to prevent future breaches, including organizational changes, deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies, increased employee training, and engagement of third-party experts and consultants. The costs incurred to remediate any security incident could be substantial.In addition, we cannot assure you that any of our third-party service providers with access to our sensitive or confidential information, or to that of our customers and/or employees, will not experience security breaches or attempts thereof, which could have a corresponding effect on our business.The manufacture of our products requires strict adherence to regulatory requirements governing medical devices and if we or our suppliers encounter problems our business could suffer.The manufacture of our products must comply with strict regulatory requirements governing Class II medical devices in the U.S. and other regulatory requirements in foreign locations. Problems may arise during manufacturing, quality control, storage, or distribution of our products for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, manufacturing quality concerns, or problems with raw materials, electromechanical, software and other components, supplier issues, and natural disasters. If problems arise during production, the affected products may have to be discarded. Manufacturing problems or delays could also lead to increased costs, lost sales, damage to customer relations, failure to supply penalties, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches of products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, voluntary recalls, corrective actions, or product liability related 24
Table of Contentscosts may also be incurred. Should we encounter difficulties in the manufacture of our products or be subject to a product recall, our business could suffer materially.Our markets are very competitive, and we sell certain of our products in a mature market.The market for our 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system is well-developed and sales growth for our monitor could be slower than we anticipate. Our vital signs monitoring system could face difficult competition, including competitors offering lower prices, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and margins. Our competitors may have certain advantages, which include the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products. Consequently, we may need to increase our efforts, and related expenses for research and development, marketing, and selling to maintain or improve our position. We may not realize the per unit revenue we have planned for and expect. Continued sales to our existing customers are expected to be significant to our revenue in the future, and if our existing customers do not continue to purchase from us, our revenue may decline.We manufacture and store our products at a single facility in Florida.We manufacture and store our products at a single facility in Winter Springs, Florida, which is also the location of our principal executive offices. If by reason of fire, hurricane, or other natural disaster, or for any other reason, the facility is destroyed or seriously damaged or our access to it is limited, our ability to provide products to our customers would be seriously interrupted or impaired completely and our operating results and financial condition would be materially and negatively affected. Our insurance may not cover our losses in any particular case. In addition, regardless of the level of insurance coverage, damage to our facility may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.​Our manufacturing facility in Winter Springs, Florida, is our only manufacturing facility, and if it is damaged orrendered inoperable or inaccessible due to political, social or economic upheaval or due to natural or other disasters, itwould be difficult or impossible for us to manufacture our product for a period of time, which may lead to a loss of customers and significant impairment of our financial condition and operating results.​If we fail to maintain relationships with IDNs and GPOs, sales of our products could decline.Our ability to sell our products to U.S. hospitals, acute care facilities and outpatient imaging centers depends in part on our relationships with IDNs and GPOs.Many existing and potential customers for our products are members of GPOs. GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts, which are sometimes exclusive, with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a GPO’s affiliated hospitals and other members. We pay the GPOs an administrative fee in the form of a percentage of the volume of products sold to their affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not an approved provider selected by a GPO, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products. Should a GPO negotiate a sole source or bundling contract covering a future or current competitor’s products, we may be precluded from making sales of our competing products to members of that GPO for the duration of the contractual arrangement. For example, even if we have an existing contract with a GPO for sales of our MRidium 3860+ MRI compatible IV infusion pump, we may encounter difficulties in selling, or be unable to sell, our 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system to that GPO’s affiliated hospitals and other members, which may result in a longer sales cycle or an inability to sell. Our failure to renew contracts with GPOs may cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. In the future, if another competitive supplier emerges, and we fail to keep our relationships and develop new relationships with GPOs, our competitive position would likely suffer.The lengthy sales cycle for medical devices could delay our sales.The decision-making process of customers is often complex and time-consuming. Based on our experience, we believe the period between initial discussions with customers regarding our products and a customer’s purchase of our 25
Table of Contentsproducts have varied widely and have historically ranged between three and six months in duration. Sales cycles can also be delayed because of capital budgeting procedures. Moreover, even if one or two units are sold to a hospital, we believe that it will take additional time and experience with our products before other medical professionals routinely use them for other procedures and in other departments of the hospital. Such time would delay potential sales of additional units and disposable products or additional optional accessories to that medical facility or hospital. These delays could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Because we rely on distributors to sell our products outside of the U.S., our revenues could decline if our existing distributors do not continue to purchase products from us or if our relationship with any of these distributors is terminated.We rely on distributors for all our sales outside the U.S. and hence do not have direct control over foreign sales activities. These distributors also assist us with regulatory approvals and the education of physicians and government agencies. Our revenues outside the U.S. in fiscal year 2024 represented approximately 17 percent of our net revenues. If our existing international distributors fail to sell our products or sell at lower levels than we anticipate, we could experience a decline in revenues or fail to meet our forecasts. We cannot be certain that we will be able to attract new international distributors nor retain existing ones that market our products effectively or provide timely and cost-effective customer support and service. None of our existing distributors are obligated to continue selling our products.If we do not successfully develop and commercialize enhanced products or new products that remain competitive, we could lose revenue opportunities and customers, and our ability to achieve growth would be impaired.The medical device industry is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances, which places our products at risk of obsolescence. Our long-term success depends upon the development and successful commercialization of new products, new or improved technologies and additional applications for MRI compatible infusion, therapeutic, diagnostic and safety products and services. The research and development process is time-consuming and costly and may not result in products or applications that we can successfully commercialize. If we do not successfully adapt our technology, products, and applications, we could lose revenue opportunities and customers. In addition, we may not be able to improve our products or develop new products or technologies quickly enough to maintain a competitive position in our markets and continue to grow our business.We are highly dependent on our founder, Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer, Roger Susi.We believe that Mr. Susi will continue to play a significant role in the development of new products. Our current and future operations could be adversely impacted if we were to lose his services. Accordingly, our success will be dependent on appropriately managing the risks related to maintaining his continued services, including having a succession plan.We may be unable to scale our operations successfully.We are working to expand our size and scale via more penetration of existing markets and the launch of new complementary products and updates to existing products. This growth, if it occurs as planned, will place significant demands on our management and manufacturing capacity, as well as our financial, administrative, and other resources. We cannot guarantee that any of the personnel, systems, procedures, controls and new facilities we put in place will be adequate to support the manufacture and distribution of our products. Our operating results will depend substantially on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our financial and administrative systems and manage other resources. If we are unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions, or the scale of our products, services, and operations, then the quality of our services, our ability to retain key personnel and our business could be harmed. In February 2023, we purchased 26 acres of land in Orlando, Florida and continue construction on an expanded facility to increase capacity. Any failure to successfully complete construction and operate such a facility expansion might limit our ability to grow as we expect.
We do not plan to retain the current Winter Springs, Florida leased facility once the larger facility is fully operational.26
Table of ContentsWe engage in related party transactions, which result in a conflict of interest involving our management.We have engaged in the past, and continue to engage, in related party transactions, particularly between our Company and Roger Susi and his affiliates. The only significant ongoing related party transaction is the lease agreement between our Company and Susi, LLC, an affiliate of Roger Susi, with respect to our current sole production and headquarters facility in Winter Springs, Florida. Related party transactions that present difficult conflicts of interest, could result in disadvantages to our Company, and may impair investor confidence, which could materially and adversely affect us. Related party transactions could also cause us to become materially dependent on related parties in the ongoing conduct of our business, and related parties may be motivated by personal interests to pursue courses of action that are not necessarily in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders. The newly constructed, larger facility, expected to be occupied in mid-2025, will reduce our related party transaction exposure by the eventual termination of the current lease with Susi, LLC.The environment in which we operate makes it difficult to accurately forecast our business performance.Significant changes and volatility in most aspects of the current business environment, including financial markets, customer behavior, speed of technological, regulatory, and competitive changes, and the recent health pandemic, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our revenues and earnings into the future. Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders fulfilled during the quarter, and such orders are difficult to forecast. Product demand is dependent upon the capital spending budgets of our customers and prospects as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy as well as product and economic cycles that can affect the spending decisions of these entities. As a result, any revenue, earnings or financial guidance or outlook which we have given or might give may turn out to be inaccurate. Though we endeavor to give reasonable estimates of future revenues, earnings, and financial information at the time we give such guidance, based on then-current conditions, there is a significant risk that such guidance or outlook will turn out to be incorrect. Historically, companies that have overstated their operating guidance have suffered significant declines in their stock price when such lesser results are announced to the public.There are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Furthermore, portions of U.S. GAAP require the use of fair value models which are variable in application and methodology from appraiser to appraiser. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Such assumptions and estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accruals for product returns, allowances for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, impairment of intangibles and long-lived assets, accounting for leases, accounting for income taxes and stock-based compensation and allowances for uncertainties. These factors are also influenced by regular changes to U.S. GAAP, some of which are material to many companies. These changes introduce risk to our financial reporting processes due to implementation and internal control implications.We base the aforementioned estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed in greater detail in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our actual operating results may differ and fall below our assumptions and the financial forecasts of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a significant decline in our stock price.Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results.In July 2024, the Company received notice of examination from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) for the tax year ended December 31, 2021. We are currently complying with the taxing authority and believe our tax position for the year under review was appropriate and have not accounted for any proposed adjustments at this time.27
Table of ContentsWe are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, but the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. ​The constant growth and development of technology, including the increased use of Artificial Intelligence, presentsrisks and challenges to our operations that could give rise to legal or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm of our business.​Emerging technology is a consistent subject of new laws or regulations and evolving interpretations and applications of laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we may be subject to penalties, fines or criminal or civil liability. The development and use of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) presents new risks and challenges that can impact our operations if we incorporate AI into our operations, or if used by our third-party vendors. While we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and attempt to mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving and the technologies that we develop or use may ultimately be flawed. If our AI technologies fail to operate as anticipated or not perform as specified, including any biases or errors in the outputs of AI, patient care may be affected, legal claims may be asserted against us and our reputation may be harmed. Moreover, AI technology is subject to rapidly evolving domestic and international laws and regulations, which could impose significant costs and obligations on the Company. For example, in 2023 the Biden Administration issued a new, executive order on safe, secure and trustworthy AI, including transparency requirements for AI and other predictive algorithms that are part of certified health information technology. Some states have adopted or are considering additional measures regarding the use of AI within the health care industry. Emerging regulations may pertain to data privacy, data protection, and the ethical use of AI, as well as clarifying intellectual property considerations. Our use of AI could give rise to legal or regulatory action, increased scrutiny or liability, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business. Additionally, if we fail to keep pace with various AI technological developments, our competitive position and business results may benegatively impacted.​Risks Related to Our IndustryWe are subject to substantial government regulation that is subject to change and could force us to make modifications to how we develop, manufacture, market, and price our products.The medical device industry is regulated extensively by governmental authorities, principally the FDA in the U.S. and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. The majority of our manufacturing processes are required to comply with quality systems regulations, including current good manufacturing practice requirements that cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of our products. Failure to comply with applicable medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspensions of production, refusal of the FDA or other regulatory agencies to grant pre-market clearances or approvals for our products, withdrawals, or suspensions of future or current clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.In addition, our products are subject to pre-clearance requirements by the FDA and similar international agencies that govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales, and distribution. Compliance with these regulations is time consuming, burdensome, and expensive for us. The failure to obtain, or the loss or suspension of any such pre-approval, would negatively affect our ability to sell our products and harm our anticipated revenues.28
Table of ContentsForeign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, to the extent we sell our products in foreign countries, we may be subject to more rigorous regulation in the future. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue. If we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or other necessary approvals to commercially distribute new products, our ability to maintain profitability or grow will suffer.Our current products are Class II medical devices and hence require regulatory pre-market approval by the FDA and other federal and state authorities prior to their sale in the U.S. Similar approvals are required by foreign governmental authorities for sale of our products outside of the U.S., including the EU. We are responsible for obtaining the applicable regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our products. As part of our strategy, we plan to seek approvals for new or improved MRI compatible products. The process of obtaining approvals is costly and time consuming, and there can be no assurance that we will obtain the required approvals on a timely basis, or at all. Failure to receive approvals for new products will hurt our ability to grow.We are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S.Sales to customers outside of the U.S. were approximately 17 percent of our net revenues in 2024 and we expect that non-U.S. sales will contribute to future growth. A majority of our international sales originate from Europe and Japan, and we also make sales in Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, Mexico and certain parts of the Middle East. The risks associated with operations outside the U.S. include:●foreign regulatory and governmental requirements that could change and restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products;●possible failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;●foreign currency fluctuations that can impact our financial statements when foreign denominations, particularly the Japanese yen, are translated into U.S. dollars;●different local product preferences and product requirements, which might increase with increasing nationalism;●trade protection and restriction measures under international trade treaties and via tariffs, and import or export licensing requirements;●difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-U.S. operations;●failure to maintain relationships with distributors, especially those who have assisted with foreign regulatory or government clearances;●uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures, changes in labor, environmental, health and safety laws;●healthcare crises or epidemics;●potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws, including U.S. state and foreign tax jurisdiction responses to recent changes in U.S. federal tax laws and tariff practices;●political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, including instability related to war and terrorist attacks, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and conflict in the Middle East;29
Table of Contents●longer payment cycles;●economic instability, inflation, deflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations;●potential disruption in supply chains; and●minimal or diminished protection of intellectual property.These risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We may incur product liability losses or become subject to other lawsuits related to our products, business, and insurance coverage could be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses.Our business is subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of our medical devices and disposable products. We carry third-party product liability insurance coverage to protect against such risks, but there can be no assurance that our policy is adequate. In the ordinary course of business, we may become the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that our products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could be costly to defend and could result in settlement payments and adjustments not covered by or in excess of our product liability insurance. We currently have third-party product liability insurance with maximum coverage of $5,000,000; however, such coverage requires a substantial deductible that we must pay before becoming eligible to receive any insurance proceeds. The deductible amount is currently equal to $50,000 per occurrence and $150,000 in the aggregate. We will have to pay for defending product liability or other claims that are not covered by our insurance. These payments could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts, recalls or corrective actions, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers. In addition, we may not be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all.Our products or product types, or MR imaging could be subject to negative publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.The market’s perception of our products could be harmed if any of our products or similar products offered by others in our industry become the subject of negative publicity due to a product safety issue, withdrawal, recall, or are proven or are claimed to be harmful to patients. The harm to market perception may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.Our products are designed for use around MRI scanners. MRI has been an important imaging diagnostic for some time now, however, should traditional MRI technology change materially or decline in usage due to new technologies or concerns about costs or efficacy of MR imaging, our products would suffer as MRI usage and installations declined. Such a matter may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.U.S. healthcare policy and changes thereto, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our medical devices and business activities are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and international governmental authorities. These authorities and members of Congress have been increasing their scrutiny over the medical device industry. The current government administration has not indicated whether it will continue to scrutinize our industry as closely as it has in the past.
Any new regulations or statutory provisions could result in delays or increased costs during the periods of product development, clinical trials and regulatory review and approval, as well as increased costs to assure compliance. Furthermore, certain state governments have enacted 30
Table of Contentslegislation to limit and/or increase transparency of interactions with healthcare providers, pursuant to which we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers licensed by certain states.In addition, with the current political climate, funding adjustments that change or impact Medicare or Medicaid as well as general uncertainties regarding these programs may impact a hospitals ability to honor payment obligations. We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations that could result in significant liability, require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future.We and our customers are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and Veterans’ Administration health programs and health programs outside the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to alter one or more of our sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, and financial condition. Furthermore, since many of our customers rely on reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, and other governmental programs to cover a substantial portion of their expenditures, if we or our customers are excluded from such programs as a result of a violation of these laws, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We have developed and implemented business practices and processes to train our personnel to perform their duties in compliance with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and conduct informal oversight to detect and prevent these types of fraud and abuse. However, we lack formal written policies and procedures at this time. If we are unable to formally document and implement the controls and procedures required in a timely manner or we are otherwise found to be in violation of such laws, we might suffer adverse regulatory consequences or face criminal sanctions, which could harm our operations, financial reporting, or financial results.We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We intend to adopt policies for compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties.We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees, or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.We and our suppliers and customers are required to obtain regulatory approvals and maintain compliance with regulations applicable to medical devices, including infusion pumps, and these approvals could result in delays or increased costs in developing new products, subject us to sanctions and could adversely affect our business.In December 2014, the FDA issued guidance entitled “Infusion Pumps Total Product Life Cycle.” This guidance established substantial additional pre-market requirements for new and modified infusion pumps. Through this guidance, the FDA indicated more data demonstrating product safety will be required for future 510(k) submissions for infusion pumps, including the potential for more clinical and human factors data. The process for obtaining regulatory approvals to market infusion pumps and related accessories have become more costly and time consuming. The impact of this guidance is likely to result in a more time consuming and costly process to obtain regulatory clearance to market infusion pumps. In addition, new requirements could result in longer delays for the clearance of new products, modification of existing infusion pump products or remediation of existing products in the market. Future delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals could result in delayed or no realization of product revenues.31
Table of ContentsEven if able to obtain approval for introducing new products to the market, we and our suppliers may not be able to remain in compliance with the applicable FDA and other material regulatory requirements once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, off-label marketing, advertising and post-marketing reporting, adverse event reports and field alerts. Compliance with these FDA requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In addition, manufacturing flaws, component failures, design defects, off-label uses by practitioners, or inadequate disclosure of product related information could result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient. All these events could harm our sales, margins and profitability in the affected periods and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Any adverse regulatory action or action taken by us to maintain appropriate regulatory compliance, with respect to these laws and regulations could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, and financial condition. Furthermore, an adverse regulatory action with respect to any of our products or operating procedures or to our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities could materially harm our reputation in the marketplace.Risks Relating to our Intellectual PropertyOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property, unpatented trade secrets, know-how, confidential and proprietary information, and technology.We intend to rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our technologies and products. We cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken or will take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that they will deter infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our intellectual property. We may fail to secure patents that are important to our business, and we cannot guarantee that any pending U.S. trademark or patent application, if ultimately issued, will provide us some relative competitive advantage. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights.Any litigation could result in substantial expenses and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of some of the countries in which our products may in the future be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, or at all. We may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries. If our trade secrets become known, we may lose our competitive advantages.Even if we are able to secure necessary patents in the U.S., we may not be able to secure necessary patents and trademarks in foreign countries in which we sell our products or plan to sell our products. In 2013, the U.S. transitioned to a “first inventor to file” system for patents in which, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application is entitled to a patent. We may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter parties review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third party patent rights.We rely on unpatented trade secrets, know-how and technology. This intellectual property is difficult to protect, especially in the medical device industry, where much of the information about a product must be submitted to regulatory authorities during the clearance process. We seek to protect trade secrets, confidential information, and proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants, and others. These parties may breach or terminate these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for such breaches. Furthermore, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information or result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information or other 32
Table of Contentsbreaches of the agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and our other confidential and proprietary information, we or our collaboration partners, Board members, employees, consultants, contractors, or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors.There is a risk that our trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information could have been, or could, in the future, be shared by any of our former employees with, and be used to the benefit of, any company that competes with us.If we fail to maintain trade secret protection or fail to protect the confidentiality of our other confidential and proprietary information, our competitive position may be adversely affected. Competitors may also independently discover our trade secrets. Enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. If our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, we would not be able to effectively assert our trade secret protections against them, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.There can be no assurance of timely patent review and approval that would minimize competition and allow us to generate sufficient revenues.There can be no assurance that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will have sufficient resources to review our patent applications in a timely manner. Consequently, even if our patent applications are ultimately successful, our patent applications may be delayed, which would prevent intellectual property protection for our products. If we fail to successfully commercialize our products due to the lack of intellectual property protection, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to meet or grow our business according to our expected goals and this may have a materially adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition, and operations.We may become involved in patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings relating to our current and future product clearances, which could result in liability for damages or delay or stop our development and commercialization efforts.The medical device industry has been characterized by significant litigation and other proceedings regarding patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property rights. The situations in which we may become parties to such litigation or proceedings may include any third parties (which may have substantially greater resources than we have) initiating litigation claiming that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights; in such case, we will need to defend against such proceedings.The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technologies involved, and the uncertainty of litigation significantly increase the risks related to any patent litigation. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:●stop selling, making, or using products that use the disputed intellectual property;●obtain a license from the intellectual property owner to continue selling, making, licensing, or using products, which license may require substantial royalty payments and may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;●pay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;●pay the attorney fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing; or●redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive and/or infeasible.33
Table of ContentsIf any of the foregoing events occur, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As the number of participants in our industry grows, the possibility of intellectual property infringement claims against us increases.Furthermore, the costs of resolving any patent litigation or other intellectual property proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other intellectual property proceedings may also consume significant management time.In the event that a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those rights may be costly, difficult, and time-consuming. Even if successful, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time-consuming and could divert our management’s attention. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patent or other intellectual property rights against a challenge. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing and protecting our intellectual property rights and protecting our products, it could materially harm our business.There may also be situations where we use our business judgment and decide to market and sell products, notwithstanding the fact that allegations of patent infringement(s) have not been finally resolved by the courts (i.e., an “at-risk launch”). The risk involved in doing so can be substantial because the remedies available to the owner of a patent for infringement may include, among other things, damages measured by the profits lost by the patent owner and not necessarily by the profits earned by the infringer. In the case of a willful infringement, the definition of which is subjective, such damages may be increased up to three times. An adverse decision could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.In addition, we may indemnify our customers and distributors with respect to infringement by our products of the proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers or distributors. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers or distributors, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or distributors or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockOur common stock price has been and will likely continue to be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility, and you may be unable to sell your shares at a fair price, or at all.Our stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, including the following:●sales of large blocks of our stock or lack of liquidity in the public trading of our common stock;●the commercial success or failure of our key products;●delayed or reduced orders from our customers;●negative developments concerning our sources of manufacturing or manufacturing or supply interruptions;●changes or developments in laws or regulations applicable to our products and product candidates;●introduction of competitive products or technologies;34
Table of Contents●poorly executed acquisitions or acquisitions whose projected potential is not realized;●actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;●failure to meet or exceed our own estimates and projections or the estimates and projections of securities analysts or investors;●new or revised earnings estimates or guidance by us or securities analysts or investors;●varying economic and market conditions in the U.S.;●negative developments impacting the medical device industry in general and changes in the market valuations of companies deemed similar to us;●disputes or other developments relating to patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights;●litigation or investigations involving us, our industry, or both;●issuances of debt, equity or convertible securities at terms deemed unfavorable by the market;●major catastrophic events;●changes in our Board of Directors, management or key personnel; or●the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section.Any one of the factors above, or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above, may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results, fluctuations in our share price and investors’ perception of our business. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, our business and stock price could be materially adversely affected.Any use of capital to repurchase shares of our common stock, need to or choice to raise future capital, the election to continue, reduce or cease to pay a regular cash dividend, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and our business.Our Board of Directors has historically authorized stock repurchase programs and, pursuant to these authorizations, we have used a significant amount of cash to repurchase shares of common stock of our Company. If our Board of Directors authorize another stock repurchase program, there can be no assurance that we will be able to repurchase shares on favorable terms or, if we do repurchase shares, that such repurchases will increase stockholder value. Stock repurchases now are burdened with a federal excise tax which diminishes their attraction to deliver returns to stockholders.In February 2025, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share. Even though our Board of Directors has approved the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on the Company’s common stock, there can be no assurance as to whether or when we may pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Future dividends, if any, will be declared and paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors. In the future, the Board of Directors may elect to allocate capital based on our continued ability to generate cash from operations, our capital needs to support normal operations, and making investments aimed at supporting growth, rather than paying cash dividends. These capital allocation decisions could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. If the Board of Directors chose to reduce or omit a dividend and retain future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business, realization of a gain on your investment will depend solely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur.35
Table of ContentsAdditionally, if we use a significant portion of our capital to repurchase shares or pay cash dividends, our financial flexibility will be reduced, and we may not be able to execute on other strategic initiatives or tolerate periods of operating losses. If we repurchase shares on unfavorable terms or if our use of capital to repurchase shares or pay cash dividends inhibits our ability to pursue other strategic initiatives or tolerate periods of operating losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and our business.While we believe that our cash and investment balances and prospective cash flow from our operations will provide us with adequate capital to fund operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of the issuance of the financial statements included herein, we may need or choose to raise additional funds prior to that time. We may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, or at all. The sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these securities could have rights that are senior to holders of common stock and any debt securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. The sale of such securities could hurt demand for our common stock and cause our share price to decline.The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified Board members.As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to monitor and advise us regarding compliance, which will increase our costs and expenses.In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We may need to invest in additional resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be adversely affected.We believe that being a public company and compliant with these rules and regulations has made it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on the Board of Directors’ audit committee (the “Audit Committee”) and compensation committee (the “Compensation Committee”).Roger Susi, who serves as our Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer, owns a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.Mr. Susi, our founder, who serves as our Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer, and his affiliates, beneficially own approximately 36 percent of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2024. Mr. Susi may be able to significantly influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions, or other extraordinary transactions. He may also have 36
Table of Contentsinterests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree, and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of promoting, delaying or deterring a change of control of our Company.Our business practices are more visible as a public company, and this could impact our competitive environment and risk of potential litigation or involvement in securities class action litigation that could adversely affect our business and could subject us to significant liabilities.As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition are more visible than a privately-held company, potentially exposing us to new competition and threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. New competition could result in reduced sales of our products and adversely impact our profitability. If lawsuits prevail against us, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.The stock markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of small capitalization medical device companies. These broad market fluctuations as well a broad range of other factors, including the realization of any of the risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities, whatever the cause. We have become, and may in the future, become involved in this type of litigation. Litigation is expensive and could divert management’s attention and resources from our primary business, which could adversely affect our operating results. Any adverse determination in any such litigation or any amounts paid to settle any such actual or threatened litigation could require us to make significant payments. Such payment could have a material impact on how investors view our Company and result in a decline in our stock price.If securities or industry analysts fail to initiate research coverage of our stock, downgrade our stock, or discontinue coverage, our trading volume might be reduced, and our stock price could decline.The trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business. If securities or industry analysts do not commence or continue coverage of our Company, the trading market for our stock may not be robust and the price of our stock could likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, and later downgrade our stock or discontinue such coverage, our stock price could decline.Our charter documents and Delaware law have provisions that may discourage an acquisition of us by others and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.Provisions in our charter documents, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), could depress the trading price of our common stock by making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us at a price favorable to our stockholders. These provisions include:●authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval to defend against a takeover attempt; and●establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors. We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our Board of Directors. This 37

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITYIRadimed employs a multilayer approach to addressing cybersecurity risk based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework. It has established a cybersecurity team that utilizes internal and external assessments, automated monitoring tools, and input from public and private partners to identify potential cyber threats. External third-party security firms are engaged to assist with cybersecurity risk assessments, penetration testing and system security analysis. ​Our cybersecurity team works in conjunction with management, legal, finance, accounting, operations, and information technology areas to assess the risk these identified cybersecurity threats present to the organization. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for overseeing our information technology leadership team and leading the Company’s efforts to mitigate technology risks in partnership with various business leaders in the organization. To ensure consistency, these cybersecurity risk assessments are incorporated into IRadimed’s enterprise risk management process, and our information technology leadership team reviews the Company’s enterprise risk management-level cybersecurity risks on a quarterly basis, and key cybersecurity risks are incorporated into the enterprise risk management framework. Cybersecurity risks are managed and controlled through multiple overlapping layers of cybersecurity defenses that include:​●the implementation of a comprehensive cybersecurity policy that encompasses but is not limited to, information governance, monitoring, authentication, encryption, vulnerability management, third-party management, and recovery;​●required annual cybersecurity training for all employees with additional supplemental cybersecurity training required based on role;​●random employee phish testing, training and follow-up;​●procedural and automated cyber controls in conjunction with robust detection, mitigation, and recovery capabilities;​●the integration of multiple threat intelligence sources into our cybersecurity tools and processes;​●the retention of external cybersecurity threat response resources; and​●the formation of a multidisciplinary cybersecurity incident response team.​The Board provides enterprise-level oversight of risks associated with cybersecurity threats through the Audit Committee, which serves and functions as the Board’s primary oversight body to monitor the Company’s cybersecurity and related information technology risks and assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities regarding Company policies and processes with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including any significant non-financial risk exposures; reviewing and discussing our information security policies and internal controls regarding information security; and reviewing the  annual disclosures concerning the role of the Board in the risk oversight of the Company. The Audit Committee performs an annual review of the cybersecurity program and receives regular updates on key cybersecurity risks, the cybersecurity risk management plan, and cyber incident event trends.  The Audit Committee 38
Table of Contentsoversees the Company’s disclosure of any cybersecurity incident deemed material (and such materiality determination will be made by the Board upon recommendation of the Audit Committee) as required by the SEC or any other governmental authority, as applicable.​In addition to managing our own cybersecurity preparedness, we also consider and evaluate cybersecurity risks associated with the use of third-party service providers. Risk assessments are performed against third-party service providers with a specific focus on any sensitive data that is to be shared with them. The internal business owners of vertical applications are required to document user access reviews regularly. We request a System and Organizational Controls (“SOC”) 2 report from the vendors of our enterprise cloud applications. If they do not provide us with a SOC 2, we seek additional compensating risk assurance in our contract language with them. Risks associated with the use of third-party service providers are managed as part of our overall cybersecurity risk management framework.​To continually manage and control the material risks that cybersecurity threats present to the organization, IRadimed invests significantly in the cybersecurity elements outlined above. In addition, the Company has made investments to fulfill the operational and financial regulatory requirements laid out by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.​IRadimed faces a number of cybersecurity risks in connection with its business. Although such risks have not materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial conditions, to date, we have, from time to time, experienced threats to and breaches of our data systems, including malware, phishing and computer virus attacks. ​ITEM 2. PROPERTIESOur principal executive offices are currently located in a leased facility of approximately 23,100 square feet located in Winter Springs, Florida. This facility has been leased from an entity controlled by our founder, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Roger Susi, Susi LLC. On May 29, 2024, the Company entered into a lease amendment (the “Lease Amendment”) with Susi, LLC under which it did not exercise the second five-year option because of the Company’s continued construction of a new corporate office and manufacturing facility in Orange County, Florida, to accommodate our increased operations and anticipated growth. Pursuant to the terms of the Lease Amendment, the monthly base rent is $34,133, adjusted annually for changes in the consumer price index, and the Lease Amendment has an expiration date of May 31, 2025, and includes an option to renew on a month-to-month basis for up to six months thereafter. This Lease Amendment does not contain any residual value guarantee or material restrictive covenants In February 2023, we entered into two, two-year, non-cancelable operating leases for approximately 5,400 square feet of additional office space in Winter Springs, Florida. Pursuant to the lease terms the total monthly base rent is $10,055. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid $126,522 and $110,605 respectively. Under the terms of the leases, we are responsible for insurance and maintenance expenses. Pursuant to the contract terms, these leases expired February 2025, which the Company did not extend, and does not contain any residual value guarantee or material restrictive covenants.ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings for which we may not have insurance coverage. While many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty as of the date hereof, we do not currently believe that any such legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYou should read this discussion and analysis together with our audited financial statements, the notes to such statements and the other financial information included in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under the section entitled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See “CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.Our BusinessWe develop, manufacture, market and distribute MRI compatible medical devices and accessories, disposables and services relating to them.We are a leader in the development of innovative MRI compatible medical devices. We are the only known provider of a non-magnetic IV infusion pump system that is specifically designed to be safe for use during MRI procedures. We were the first to develop an infusion delivery system that largely eliminates many of the dangers and problems present during MRI procedures. Standard infusion pumps contain magnetic and electronic components which can create radio frequency interference and are dangerous to operate in the presence of the powerful magnet that drives an MRI system. Our patented MRidium® MRI compatible IV infusion pump system has been designed with a non-magnetic ultrasonic motor, uniquely designed non-ferrous parts and other special features to safely and predictably deliver anesthesia and other IV fluids during various MRI procedures. Our pump solution provides a seamless approach that enables accurate, safe and dependable fluid delivery before, during and after an MRI scan, which is important to critically ill patients who cannot be removed from their vital medications, and children and infants who must generally be sedated to remain immobile during an MRI scan.Each IV infusion pump system generally consists of an MRidium® MRI compatible IV infusion pump, non-magnetic mobile stand, proprietary disposable IV tubing sets and many of these systems contain additional optional upgrade accessories.Our 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system has been designed with non-magnetic components and other special features to safely and accurately monitor a patient’s vital signs during various MRI procedures. The IRADIMED 3880 system operates dependably in magnetic fields up to 30,000 gauss, which means it can operate virtually anywhere in the MRI scanner room. The IRADIMED 3880 has a compact, lightweight design allowing it to travel with the patient from their critical care unit, to the MRI and back, resulting in increased patient safety through uninterrupted vital signs monitoring and decreasing the amount of time critically ill patients are away from critical care units. The features of the IRADIMED 3880 include: wireless ECG with dynamic gradient filtering; wireless SpO2 using Masimo® algorithms; non-magnetic respiratory CO2; invasive and non-invasive blood pressure; patient temperature; and optional advanced multi-gas anesthetic agent unit featuring continuous Minimum Alveolar Concentration measurements. The IRADIMED 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system has an easy-to-use design and allows for the effective communication of patient vital signs information to clinicians.We generate revenue from the sale of MRI compatible medical devices and accessories, extended warranty agreements, services related to maintaining our products and the sale of disposable products used with our devices. The principal customers for our MRI compatible products include hospitals and acute care facilities, both in the United States and internationally. As of December 31, 2024, our direct U.S. sales force consisted of 27 field sales representatives, 4 regional sales directors and supplemented by 10 clinical application specialists. Internationally, we have distribution agreements with independent distributors selling our products.Selling cycles for our devices have varied widely and have historically ranged between three and six months in duration. We also enter into agreements with IDNs and healthcare supply contracting companies, which are commonly referred to as GPOs in the U.S., which enable us to sell and distribute our products to their member hospitals. GPOs negotiate volume purchase prices for hospitals, group practices, and other clinics that are members of a GPO. Under our 42
Table of ContentsGPO agreements, we are required to pay the GPOs a fee of three percent of the sales of our products to members of the GPO.
Sales to participating IDNs do not have an associated fee.Financial Highlights and OutlookOur revenue was $73.2 million in 2024 and $65.6 million in 2023. Our diluted earnings per share was $1.50 in 2024, and $1.35 in 2023. Our cash provided by operations was $25.6 million in 2024, and $13.5 million in 2023.Our estimated cumulative unit sales of medical devices are as follows:​​​​​​​December 31, ​    2024    2023IV Infusion Pump Systems  7,832  7,196Patient Vital Signs Monitoring Systems  2,679  2,166​Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Financial Statements. However, we believe that the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgments. The use of different estimates, assumptions and judgments could have a material effect on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting period.Revenue RecognitionWe generate revenue from the sale of MRI compatible medical devices and accessories, extended warranty agreements, services related to maintaining our products and the sale of disposable products used with our devices. The principal customers for our MRI compatible products include hospitals and acute care facilities, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S. we sell our products through our direct sales force and outside of the U.S. we sell our products through third-party distributors who resell our products to end users.For many domestic sales, we enter into agreements with IDN systems and healthcare supply contracting companies, commonly referred to as GPOs.GPO agreements enable us to sell and distribute our products to their member hospitals. Our agreements with GPOs typically include negotiated pricing for all group members established at time of GPO contract execution. Under these agreements, we are required to pay the GPOs a fee of three percent of the sales of our products to members of the GPO. We do not sell to GPOs. Hospitals, group practices and other acute care facilities that are members of a GPO, purchase products directly from us under the terms of our GPO agreements.We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: we have a contract with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations; promised products or services are identified; the transaction price, or the amount we expect to receive, is determinable and we have transferred control of the promised products or services to the customer. We consider transfer of control evidenced upon the passage of title and risks and rewards of ownership to the customer, which is typically at a point in time, except for our extended warranty agreements. We allocate the transaction price using the relative standalone selling price method.Customer sale prices for our medical devices and related disposables and services are contractually fixed over the contract term. We recognize a receivable at the point in time we have an unconditional right to payment. Payment 43
Table of Contentsterms are typically within 45 days after transferring control to U.S. customers. Most international distributors are required to pay a portion of the transaction price in advance and the remaining amount within 30 days of receiving the related products. Accordingly, we have elected to use the practical expedient that allows us to ignore the possible existence of a significant financing component within the contract.We have elected to account for shipping and handling charges billed to customers as revenue and shipping and handling related expenses as cost of revenue.In certain U.S. states we are required to collect sales taxes from our customers. We have elected to exclude the amounts collected for these taxes from revenue and record them as a liability until remitted to the taxing authority.Results of OperationsThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, selected statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenue.

Revenue from sales internationally decreased $0.4 million, or 3.1 percent, to $12.6 million from $13.0 million for the same period in 2023. Domestic sales accounted for 83 percent of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 80 percent for the same period in 2023.For the year ended December 31, 2024, revenue from sales of devices increased $6.0 million, or 13.0 percent, to $51.9 million from $45.9 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was the result of higher overall unit sales, particularly our IV infusion pump systems.For the year ended December 31, 2024, revenue from sales of our disposables, service and other increased $1.5 million, or 8.5 percent, to $19.1 million from $17.6 million for the same period in 2023. Revenue from the amortization of our extended warranty agreements increased $0.2 million, or 11.7 percent, to $2.2 million from $2.0 million for the same period in 2023.

Gross profit increased approximately $6.1 million, or 12.1 percent, to $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $50.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in cost of revenue and gross profit is primarily due to higher revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.Gross profit margin was 76.9 percent and 76.5 percent for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in gross profit margin is the result of favorable overhead variance adjustments and higher average selling prices in 2024 compared to 2023, a reduction in raw material costs, and increased management oversight of inventory. The increase in year over year sales also positively impacts the Company’s ability to favorably absorb overhead costs and increase gross profit margin.45

This increase is primarily due to higher expenses for legal and professional costs, regulatory approval and consulting costs, and payroll and employee benefits costs. These increases are a direct result of the continued growth of the Company and need for additional support resources. Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expenses increased approximately $3.5 million, or 28.6 percent, to $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $12.1 million for the same period in 2023. This increase is primarily the result of increased expenses for sales commissions, sales-related travel costs, and higher expenses for payroll and benefits. Higher commissions are related to the sales cycle, and in line with revenue growth. The increases are a direct result of the continued growth of the Company.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expense remained relatively consistent at $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $2.9 million for the same period in 2023. This is primarily due to higher payroll and benefits costs, offset by lower prototype design and consulting expenses.Other Income, NetOther income, net consists of interest income, foreign currency transactional gains and losses, and other miscellaneous income. We reported other income of approximately $2.3 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase is primarily the result of higher interest income during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.Income TaxesWe recorded a provision for income tax expense of approximately $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a tax expense of approximately $4.5 million for the same period in 2023. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 20.8 percent compared to 20.9 percent for the same period in 2023. The decrease in our effective tax rate is negligible and attributable to a number of immaterial factors. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity have historically been our cash and cash equivalents balances, our investments, cash flow from operations and access to the financial markets. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and dividend payments.46
Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2024, we had cash and investments of $52.2 million, stockholders’ equity of $86.8 million, and working capital of $66.2 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents and investments of $49.8 million, stockholders’ equity of $71.4 million, and working capital of $59.7 million as of December 31, 2023.​​​​​​​​​Year Ended​​December 31, ​​2024    2023Net cash provided by operating activities​$ 25,624,463​$ 13,465,012Net cash used in investing activities​  (8,816,786)​  (8,007,167)Net cash used in financing activities​  (14,335,968)​  (13,656,511)​Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023Operating ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2024, cash provided by operations increased $12.1 million to $25.6 million, from $13.5 million in 2023. During 2024, cash provided by operations was positively impacted by higher net income, lower inventory, lower accounts receivable, and increased stock compensation. Cash provided by operations was negatively impacted by higher accounts payable and other accruals, higher deferred revenue, and higher deferred income taxes.Investing ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2024, cash used in investing activities increased $0.8 million to $8.8 million, from $8.0 million used in 2023. During 2024, cash related to investing activities was impacted by purchases of property and equipment, specifically ongoing construction costs for our new corporate office and manufacturing facility in Orange County, Florida. Financing ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2024, cash used in financing activities increased $0.6 million to $14.3 million, from $13.7 million used in 2023. During 2024, cash used in financing activities was related to cash payments for dividends and taxes paid for the net share settlement of restricted stock units.Sales to end users in the United States are generally made on open credit terms. Management maintains an allowance for potential credit losses.Our manufacturing operations and headquarters facility is approximately 23,100 square feet located in Winter Springs, Florida. This facility has been leased from Susi, LLC, an entity controlled by our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman, Roger Susi. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Lease Amendment, the monthly base rent is $34,133, adjusted annually for changes in the consumer price index.We believe our sources of liquidity, including cash flow from operations, existing cash, and available financing sources will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued and into the foreseeable future. Any equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that increase our costs. We monitor our capital requirements to ensure our needs are in line with available capital resources. From time to time, we may explore additional financing sources to meet our working capital requirements, make continued investment in research and development, expand our business and acquire products or businesses that complement our current business. These actions would likely affect our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the:●Amount and timing of revenue and expenses;47
Table of Contents●Dividend policy;●Extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance;●Extent to which we make acquisitions;●Cost and timing of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts;●Cost and timing of selling and marketing activities; and●Availability of borrowings or other means of financing.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe develop our products in the U.S. and sell those products into approximately 80 countries throughout the world. We also purchase certain components for our products from foreign vendors. Most of our sale and purchase transactions are denominated in the U.S. Dollar. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. In addition, changes in exchange rates may also affect the end-user prices of our products compared to those of our competitors, who may be selling their products in local currencies, making our products less competitive in some countries.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our cost of revenue denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, principally the Japanese yen (“Yen”). The volatility of the Yen depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains and losses related to revaluing Yen denominated accounts payable balances. In the event our Yen denominated accounts payable or expenses increase, our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the Yen exchange rate. If the U.S. Dollar uniformly increased or decreased in strength by 10 percent relative to the Yen, our net income would have correspondingly increased or decreased by an immaterial amount for the year ended December 31, 2024.Interest Rate RiskWhen able, we invest excess cash in money-market funds, and in the past, corporate debt securities or discrete short-term investments. Our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the U.S. If market interest rates were to change by 100 basis points from levels at December 31, 2024, we expect a corresponding change of approximately $489,000 in interest income earned on our excess cash held in interest bearing accounts.ITEM 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESDisclosure Controls and ProceduresWe maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.We conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, the last day of our fiscal year. This assessment was based on criteria established in the framework Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and included an evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. Based on our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the Audit Committee.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting - (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Limitations on ControlsOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.49

Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmStockholders’ and the Board of Directors of IRADIMED CORPORATION ​​Opinion on the Financial Statements​We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of IRADIMED CORPORATION (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Basis for Opinion​These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matter​The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Deferred Revenue Recorded on the Sale of Extended Warranties​As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the financial statements, the Company recorded deferred revenue related to the sale of extended warranty agreements of $5,162,417 at December 31, 2024. The Company records contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, when it has an obligation to provide a product or service to the customer and payment is received in advance. Revenue related to extended warranty agreements is deferred and recognized over the warranty agreement period, which can range from one to four years, starting after the expiration of the initial one-year manufacturing F-2

Table of ContentsIRADIMED CORPORATIONNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1 — Organization and Significant Accounting PoliciesOrganizationIRADIMED CORPORATION (“IRADIMED”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”) was originally incorporated in Oklahoma under the name IRI Development, Inc. in 1992, and we merged our Oklahoma corporation into the newly formed Delaware corporation in April 2014. We develop, manufacture, market and distribute a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (“MRI”) compatible intravenous (“IV”) infusion pump system and MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring systems and related accessories, disposables and services.We are a leader in the development of innovative MRI compatible medical devices. We are the only known provider of a non-magnetic IV infusion pump system that is specifically designed to be safe for use during MRI procedures. We were the first to develop an infusion delivery system that largely eliminates many of the dangers and problems present during MRI procedures. Standard infusion pumps contain magnetic and electronic components which can create radio frequency interference and are dangerous to operate in the presence of the powerful magnet that drives an MRI system. Our patented MRidium® MRI compatible IV infusion pump system has been designed with a non-magnetic ultrasonic motor, uniquely designed non-ferrous parts and other special features to safely and predictably deliver anesthesia and other IV fluids during various MRI procedures. Our pump solution provides a seamless approach that enables accurate, safe and dependable fluid delivery before, during and after an MRI scan, which is important to critically ill patients who cannot be removed from their vital medications, and children and infants who must generally be sedated to remain immobile during an MRI scan.Each IV infusion pump system consists of an MRidium® MRI compatible IV infusion pump, non-magnetic mobile stand, proprietary disposable IV tubing sets and many of these systems contain additional optional upgrade accessories.Our 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system has been designed with non-magnetic components and other special features to safely and accurately monitor a patient’s vital signs during various MRI procedures. The IRADIMED 3880 system operates dependably in magnetic fields up to 30,000 gauss, which means it can operate virtually anywhere in the MRI scanner room. The IRADIMED 3880 has a compact, lightweight design allowing it to travel with the patient from their critical care unit, to the MRI and back, resulting in increased patient safety through uninterrupted vital signs monitoring and decreasing the amount of time critically ill patients are away from critical care units. The features of the IRADIMED 3880 include: wireless Electrocardiogram with dynamic gradient filtering; wireless blood oxygen saturation monitoring using Masimo® algorithms; non-magnetic respiratory carbon dioxide; invasive and non-invasive blood pressure; patient temperature, and optional advanced multi-gas anesthetic agent unit featuring continuous Minimum Alveolar Concentration measurements. The IRADIMED 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system has an easy-to-use design and allows for the effective communication of patient vital signs information to clinicians.Our principal executive offices are located in Winter Springs, Florida.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include allowances for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable, valuation of inventory, long lived assets, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, reserves for warranty obligations, and the provision for income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.F-8
Table of ContentsRevenue RecognitionWe generate revenue from the sale of MRI compatible medical devices and accessories, extended warranty agreements, services related to maintaining our products and the sale of disposable products used with our devices. The principal customers for our MRI compatible products include hospitals and acute care facilities, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S. we sell our products through our direct sales force and outside of the U.S. we sell our products through third-party distributors who resell our products to end users.For many domestic sales, we enter into agreements with integrated delivery health systems and healthcare supply contracting companies, commonly referred to as Group Purchasing Organizations (“GPOs”).GPO agreements enable us to sell and distribute our products to their member hospitals. Our agreements with GPOs typically include negotiated pricing for all group members established at the time of GPO contract execution. Under these agreements, we are required to pay the GPOs a fee of three percent of the sales of our products to members of the GPO. We do not sell to GPOs. Hospitals, group practices and other acute care facilities that are members of a GPO, purchase products directly from us under the terms of our GPO agreements.We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: we have a contract with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations; promised products or services are identified; the transaction price, or the amount we expect to receive, is determinable and we have transferred control of the promised products or services to the customer. We consider transfer of control evidenced upon the passage of title and risks and rewards of ownership to the customer, which is typically at a point in time, except for our extended warranty agreements. We allocate the transaction price using the relative standalone selling price method.Customer sale prices for our medical devices and related disposables and services are contractually fixed over the contract term. We recognize a receivable at the point in time we have an unconditional right to payment. Payment terms are typically within 45 days after transferring control to U.S. customers. Most international distributors are required to pay a portion of the transaction price in advance and the remaining amount within 30 days of receiving the related products. Accordingly, we have elected to use the practical expedient that allows us to ignore the possible existence of a significant financing component within the contract.We have elected to account for shipping and handling charges billed to customers as revenue and shipping and handling related expenses as cost of revenue.In certain U.S. states we are required to collect sales taxes from our customers. We have elected to exclude the amounts collected for these taxes from revenue and record them as a liability until remitted to the taxing authority.Contract LiabilitiesWe record contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, when we have an obligation to provide a product or service to the customer and payment is received in advance of our performance. When we sell a product or service with a future performance obligation, we defer revenue allocated to the unfulfilled performance obligation and recognize this revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.Our deferred revenue consists of advance payments received from customers prior to the transfer of products or services, shipments that are in-transit at the end of a period and sales of extended warranty agreements. Advance payments received from customers and shipments in-transit are recognized in revenue at the time control of the related products has been transferred to the customer or services have been delivered. Revenue related to extended warranty agreements is deferred and recognized over the warranty agreement period, which can range from one to four years, starting after the expiration of the initial one-year manufacturing warranty. This recognition pattern best depicts the transfer of services being provided.Deferred revenue is classified as current or long-term deferred revenue in our Balance Sheets, depending on the expected timing of satisfying the related performance obligations.F-9
Table of ContentsCapitalized Contract CostsWe capitalize commissions paid to our sales managers related to contracts with customers when the associated revenue is expected to be earned over a period of time. Deferred commissions are primarily related to the sale of extended warranty agreements. Capitalized commissions are included in Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets in our Balance Sheets when the associated expense is expected to be recognized in one year or less, or in Other Assets when the associated expense is expected to be recognized in greater than one year. The associated expense is included in Sales and Marketing expenses in our Statements of Operations.Variable ConsiderationOur sales are typically subject to 30 to 60-day customer-specified acceptance provisions primarily for purposes of ensuring products were not damaged during the shipping process. Historically, we have experienced immaterial product returns and, when experienced, we typically exchange the affected products with new products. Accordingly, variable consideration from contracts with customers is immaterial to our financial statements.Cash EquivalentsAll highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
We consider money market fund holdings to be cash equivalents.Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit LossesAccounts receivable is recorded at the transaction price of the related products and services. We regularly assess the sufficiency of the allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable. Estimates are based on historical collection experience and other customer-specific information, such as bankruptcy filings or known liquidity problems of our customers. When it is determined that an account receivable is uncollectible, it is written off and relieved from the allowance. Any future determination that the allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable is not adequate could result in changes in operating expense and results of operations. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our allowance for credit losses was $274,300 and $368,835, respectively.Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A three-level valuation hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels of inputs are:●Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for an identical asset or liability.●Level 2 — quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.●Level 3 — unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability.Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses. Cash and cash equivalents are reported at their respective fair values on the balance sheet dates. The recorded carrying amount of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates their fair values due to their short-term nature.F-10
Table of ContentsInventoryInventory is stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We may be exposed to a number of factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage. These factors include, but are not limited to, technological changes, competitive pressures in products and prices, and the introduction of new product lines. We regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of inventory based on a combination of factors, including historical usage rates, forecasted sales, product life cycles, and market acceptance of new products. When inventory that is obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage is identified, it is written down to net realizable value or an inventory valuation allowance is established.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are generally three to five years for computer software and hardware and five to seven years for furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements.Repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of our property and equipment are expensed as incurred.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets include application and legal costs incurred to obtain patents. We capitalize these costs when we determine that probable future economic benefits exist. In making this determination, we consider the projected future operating results associated with the patents, industry and economic trends, and the entry of new products in the market. Costs incurred prior to this determination are expensed in the period they are incurred. We amortize capitalized patent costs using the straight-line method over their useful lives, which is typically 20 years. Periodic costs incurred to maintain existing patents are expensed as incurred.Research & Development and Capitalized Software Development CostsResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Some of our products include embedded software which is essential to the products’ functionality. Costs incurred in the research and development of new software components and enhancements to existing software components are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established. We capitalize software development costs when the product reaches technological feasibility and cease capitalization when the product is ready for commercial sale. Capitalized software development costs are included in intangible assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the product and included in cost of revenue. Amortization begins when the product is available for general sales to customers.Long-lived AssetsLong-lived assets, such as our property and equipment and including right-of-use assets, are tested for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may be impaired. Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, technological obsolescence, unfavorable court rulings, significant negative industry and economic trends, and significant underperformance relative to historical and projected future operating results. Impairment is considered to have occurred when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset groups are less than its carrying value. Estimates of future cash flows involve consideration of many factors including the marketability of new products, product acceptance and lifecycle, competition, appropriate discount rates and operating margins. An impairment is recognized as the amount by which the carrying value is greater than the fair value of the asset or asset group.F-11
Table of ContentsWarrantyThe Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. While we engage in product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers, the estimated warranty obligation is affected by ongoing product failure rates, material usage costs and direct labor incurred in correcting a product failure. Actual product failure rates, material usage costs and the amount of labor required to repair products that differ from estimates result in revisions to the estimated liability. We warrant for a limited period of time that our products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship. We estimate warranty allowances based on historical warranty experience. The estimates we use in projecting future product warranty costs may prove to be incorrect. Any future determination that our provision for product warranty is understated could result in increases to our cost of revenue and a reduction in our operating profits and results of operations. Historically, warranty expenses have not been material to our financial statements.Stock-Based CompensationHistorically, we have granted three types of employee equity awards, stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”).We recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with employee equity awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for stock options and restricted stock units, which is generally four years for employees and two years for the Board. Expense related to our PSUs is recognized straight-line over the requisite performance period, which is three years.The grant date fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant.In December 2024 and 2023, the Company granted PSUs to certain employees under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Pan (“LTIP”), which was adopted under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. Payouts of the PSUs will be based on the Company’s total stockholder return compared to a peer group or index total stockholder return. For purposes of the LTIP, total stockholder return is calculated as the share price at the end of the performance period, which is three years, including the reinvestment of any dividends during the performance period, as compared to the share price at the beginning of the performance period. The payout range for participants will be between 0 percent and 200 percent, depending on the Company’s relative total return performance.The grant date fair value of our PSUs is based on a Monte Carlo simulation, the closing price of our common stock, and other pertinent factors on the grant date. Compensation expense for the PSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite performance period, which is three years from the grant date.We elect to recognize forfeitures as they occur.We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units and PSUs.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of F-12
Table of Contentsexisting taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. A valuation allowance is recorded to offset net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.We recognize the tax benefit of uncertain tax positions, if any, in the financial statements based on the technical merits of the position. When the tax position is deemed more likely than not of being sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being ultimately realized upon settlement.Foreign CurrencyGains and losses from transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency are included in other income, net. Foreign currency gains and losses result primarily from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Japanese Yen.Basic and Diluted Net Income per ShareBasic net income per share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. The stock options, restricted stock units, and PSUs granted by us represent the only dilutive effect reflected in diluted weighted average shares outstanding.The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended December 31, ​​2024    2023​​​​​​​Net income​$ 19,234,026​$ 17,192,776Weighted-average shares outstanding — Basic​  12,670,216​  12,602,948Effect of dilutive securities:​   ​   Stock options​  1,881​  17,654Restricted stock units​​ 60,081​  63,340Performance-based restricted stock units​  51,380​  38,588Weighted-average shares outstanding — Diluted​  12,783,558​  12,722,530Basic net income per share​$ 1.52​$ 1.36Diluted net income per share​$ 1.50​$ 1.35​Stock options to purchase shares of our common stock and restricted stock units excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive are as follows:​​​​​​​​Year Ended​​December 31, ​​2024​2023Anti-dilutive restricted stock units​ 2,583  419​Certain Significant Risks and UncertaintiesWe market our products to end users in the United States and to third-party distributors internationally. Sales to end users in the United States are generally made on open credit terms. Management maintains an allowance for potential credit losses.We have deposited our cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions. A substantial majority of our cash and cash equivalents balances exceed federally insured limits. We have not incurred any losses related to these balances.F-13
Table of ContentsOur medical devices require clearance from the Food and Drug Administration and international regulatory agencies prior to commercialized sales. Our future products may not receive required approvals. If we were denied such approvals, or if such approvals were revoked or delayed or if we were unable to timely renew certain approvals for existing products, it would have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Certain key components of our products essential to their functionality are sole-sourced. Any disruption in the availability of these components would have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Recent Accounting PronouncementsAccounting Pronouncements Implemented in 2024In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The FASB amended the guidance in ASC 280, Segment Reporting ("ASC 280"), to require a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide the new disclosures and all the disclosures required under ASC 280. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented in financial statements, unless it is impracticable. This new guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted this new standard effective December 31, 2024. See Note 6, Segment Information, for disclosures related to the adoption of ASU 2023-07.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to be ImplementedIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The update enhances the disclosure requirements related to tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. The standard will take effect for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have, if any, on our financial statements. We are adopting this ASU on January 1, 2025 and will include enhanced disclosures in our fiscal year-end 2025 annual consolidated financial statements, as applicable.​In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40), Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses ("ASU 2024-03"), and in January 2025, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.2025-01, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date ("ASU 2025-01"). ASU 2024-03 requires additional disclosure of the nature of expenses included in the income statement as well as disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented in the income statement. ASU 2024-03, as clarified by ASU 2025-01, is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Both early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on the related disclosures.​​2 — RevenueDisaggregation of RevenueWe disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers by geographic region and revenue type as we believe it best depicts the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flow.F-14

Under the terms of the lease, we are responsible for property taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses. On May 29, 2024, the Company entered into a lease amendment (the “Lease Amendment”) with Susi, LLC under which it did not exercise the second five-year option because of the Company’s continued construction of a new corporate office and manufacturing facility in Orange County, Florida, to accommodate our increased operations and anticipated growth. Pursuant to the terms of the Lease Amendment, the monthly base rent is $34,133, adjusted annually for changes in the consumer price index, and the Lease Amendment has an expiration date of May 31, 2025, and includes an option to renew on a month-to-month basis for up to six months thereafter.

We have determined that these agreements fall within the scope of ASC 460, Guarantees. We have obtained liability insurance providing coverage that limits our exposure for these indemnified matters.

As of December 31, 2024, there was no preferred stock issued or outstanding.Voting and Dividends. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock has the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock could then be converted. The holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends from legally available assets prior to any declaration or payment of dividends to the holders of Common Stock. Dividends on each share of Preferred Stock are initially at $0.06429 per year payable when and as F-22
Table of Contentsdeclared by the Board and are non-cumulative. After payment of such dividends, any additional dividends or distributions are distributed among all holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock that would be held by each holder if all shares of Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock at the then effective conversion rate. To date, no dividends have been declared.Liquidation. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our Company, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of the proceeds resulting from such liquidation event to holders of the Common Stock, an amount equal to $1.07143 plus declared but unpaid dividends. If, upon occurrence of such liquidation event, the proceeds are insufficient to permit the payment of the aforementioned amount in full, then the entire proceeds shall be distributed ratably among all holders of the Preferred Stock in proportion to the full amount each holder would otherwise receive.Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into such number of fully paid non-assessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the original issue price of each share of Preferred Stock by the applicable conversion price. The initial conversion price per share is $1.07143. Adjustments to the initial conversion price may result from a recapitalization event or changes in the number of common shares outstanding. Each share of Preferred Stock automatically converts into shares of fully paid non-assessable shares of Common Stock, at the then applicable conversion rate, upon the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting as a single class on an as-converted basis.Redemption. Upon a majority vote of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, we may, at our discretion, redeem or purchase shares of Preferred Stock. We also have a first right of refusal to repurchase shares of the Preferred Stock arising from a holder’s proposal to sell such Preferred Stock.Common StockWe are authorized to issue 31,500,000 shares of Common Stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.Voting and Dividends. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Company for their vote except for matters related to potential amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation or matters that solely relate to the terms of one or more outstanding series of our Preferred Stock. Holders of our Common Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board, dividends pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held. These dividend rights are junior to those of the holders of Preferred Stock.Liquidation. Liquidation preference to the holders of Common Stock is junior to that of the holders of Preferred Stock.Redemption. The Common Stock is not redeemable.14 — Subsequent EventsIn February 2025, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share of our outstanding common stock, payable on March 5, 2025, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 24, 2025. Total payment for this cash dividend was $2,161,522.​​F-23
