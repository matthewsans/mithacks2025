SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
prospectus contains forward-looking statements about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking
statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly
to historical or current facts. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products, market acceptance,
future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, and the outcome of contingencies such as
legal proceedings and financial results. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and include statements regarding,
among other things, our projected revenue growth and profitability, our growth strategies and opportunity, anticipated trends in our
market and our anticipated needs for working capital. They are generally identifiable by use of the words “may,” “will,”
“should,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plans,” “potential,” “continuing,”
“ongoing,” “expects,” “management believes,” “we believe,” “we intend” or
the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology.
Examples
of forward-looking statements in this prospectus include, but are not limited to, our expectations regarding our business strategy, business
prospects, operating results, operating expenses, working capital, liquidity and capital expenditure requirements. Important assumptions
relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our offerings, the cost, terms and
availability of components, pricing levels, the timing and cost of capital expenditures, competitive conditions and general economic
conditions. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. These statements are based on our management’s
expectations, beliefs and assumptions concerning future events affecting us, which are based on currently available information. Although
we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations and assumptions
may prove to be incorrect. Our statements should not read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of,
all relevant information.
Important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results and events anticipated or implied by such forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to:
●
changes
in the market acceptance of our software solutions and offerings;
●
our ability to successful
execute our growth strategy and enter into new markets;
●
our ability to expand in
existing and new markets;
●
increased
levels of competition;
●
our
relationships with our key customers;
●
changes
in customer preferences and the level of acceptance of our software services;
●
our
ability to retain and attract senior management and other key employees;
●
our
ability to quickly and effectively respond to new technological developments;
●
our
ability to protect our trade secrets or other proprietary rights, operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others
and prevent others from infringing on the proprietary rights of the Company; and
●
other
risks, including those described in the “Risk Factors” section of this prospectus.
We
operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for us to predict
all of those risks, nor can we assess the impact of all of those risks on our business or the extent to which any factor may cause actual
results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. The forward-looking statements in this prospectus
are based on assumptions management believes are reasonable. However, due to the uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements,
you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date
they are made, and unless required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to publicly update any of them in light
of new information, future events, or otherwise.

ITEM
1. BUSINESS
Overview
FatPipe
is a pioneer in enterprise-class, application-aware, secure SD-WAN solutions for organizations, including enterprises, communication
service providers, security service providers, government organizations, and other middle-market companies.
We
strive to be the global leader in delivering leading-edge enterprise-class networking software technology. We are dedicated to continually
improving the way organizations connect, ensuring their networks are secure, reliable, and supporting their continued success. Our commitment
lies in empowering our customers with a seamless and dependable connectivity infrastructure that safeguards their critical data and fosters
business continuity. We further aim to ensure our customers have unparalleled insights into their network operations.
To
deliver on this vision, we hold over a dozen software and technology patents, which we leverage through an integrated suite of software
solutions to offer our customers a reliable and secure platform to support mission-critical applications running on cloud, hybrid cloud
and on-premise networks. Our core offerings include SD-WAN, SASE, and NMS software solutions, each of which is typically offered to our
customers as a subscription service. These solutions address a broad set of network management needs and include an integrated set of
capabilities designed to manage multi-line network traffic and routing. When customers have multiple data lines, and one of the lines
fails, FatPipe automatically and dynamically transfers network traffic from one data line to another (failover) without disconnecting
the application session. When all lines are functional, FatPipe is able to improve data traffic speed and optimize bandwidth.
We
service customers in geographies around the world, with our largest customer populations located in the United States and India. We plan
to continue expanding our presence throughout North America and parts of Southeast Asia. Further, FatPipe is in discussions with potential
partners to offer geography specific software license bundles to address these market needs. Customers in different geographies require
different licenses and network servers specific to their needs and prices. We plan to expand its presence in Mexico and Asia markets
with products and services bundles to address geography specific markets,
Industry
SD-WAN
is a network architecture that allows enterprises to utilize software and virtualization technologies to enhance the performance, security,
and manageability of their WANs that connect offices, data centers, cloud applications, and cloud storage. This innovative architecture
has emerged as a force in the world of networking and connectivity, revolutionizing the way organizations manage and optimize their WANs.
SD-WAN technology enables organizations to leverage multiple types of connection, such as broadband, multiprotocol label switching, and
LTE, to create a unified and intelligent network that can be centrally managed and orchestrated. This flexibility not only improves network
efficiency but also reduces costs associated with expensive dedicated circuits, and the technology represents a seismic shift from traditional
static network architectures to dynamic, agile, and cloud-centric solutions. SD-WAN applications have gained tremendous momentum in recent
years due to its ability to address many evolving needs of modern businesses.
SASE
technology enhances network security by enabling centralized policy enforcement and encryption. It allows for granular control over traffic,
ensuring that sensitive data is transmitted securely across the network. This is particularly significant in today’s cyber-threat
landscape, where data breaches and network vulnerabilities are constant concerns for businesses of all sizes, and trends such as remote
work and distributed organizations have only served to exacerbate potential susceptibility.
4
NMS
allows for the systematic monitoring and management of computer networks. Generally consisting of an integrated set of tools, NMS solutions
provide network administrators with the ability to remotely detect and address network issues or anomalies before they affect network
performance, integrity, or end-user experience. Many NMS solutions combine multiple data collection methods to offer comprehensive insights
into a range of network performance metrics, allowing administrators to continuously and remotely optimize network configurations, troubleshoot
problems, manage capacity, identify suspicious network activity and generate analytics for further assessment.

to generate revenues, and have maintained many of these relationships for over a decade.
Our
revenues are primarily generated in the United States, with India generating an increasing share of sales since 2022. FatPipe has invested
considerable resources in developing these relationships, and our distribution arrangements are not exclusive with any partner.
In
2023, we began an extensive program to train our sales force to support domestic and international commercial accounts. The program focused
on enhancing our partners’ product knowledge and technical capabilities, and has been instrumental in driving sales growth. Further,
to minimize barriers during the sales process, FatPipe software solutions are sold off a pre-approved price list and customer contracts
between FatPipe and the end-user customer are embedded within the partner’s master agreement. After a sale, FatPipe maintains a
direct relationship with the end-user by providing installation, maintenance, and support services.
We
plan to replicate our reseller and channel partner model to enter or expand in new markets or geographies. We are currently exploring
options to grow our global sales, with emphasis on expansion opportunities within the burgeoning India information technology market.
We are in discussions with multiple potential partners in Southeast Asia, which does not include China, to address these local markets.
Further, FatPipe is in discussions with potential partners to offer geography specific software license bundles to address these market

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS
Summary
Risk Factors
Below
is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. This summary does not address all
of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can
be found below under the heading “Risk Factors” and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding our securities.
●
Our operating results are
likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable.
●
We rely heavily on our
reselling partners and our ability to work with suitable partners may impact our growth plans.
●
If we are unable to develop
and introduce new solutions and improve existing solutions in a cost-effective and timely manner, then our competitive position may
be negatively impacted and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.
●
We invest significantly
in research and development (“R&D”), and to the extent our R&D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position
may be negatively impacted and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.
●
We operate in a highly
competitive market.
●
Increases in costs of the
materials and other components that we use in our solutions would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial
condition.
●
Adverse economic conditions,
such as a possible recession and possible impacts of inflation or stagflation, increasing or decreasing interest rates, reduced information
technology spending or any economic downturn or recession, may adversely impact our business.
●
Our billings, revenue and
free cash flow growth may slow or may not continue, and our operating margins may decline.
●
We are dependent on the
continued services and performance of our senior management, the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business, operating
results and financial condition.
●
If we are unable to attract,
retain, and motivate key employees, then our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.
●
We may need to raise additional
capital in the future, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
●
If we do not increase the
effectiveness of our sales organization, we may have difficulty adding new end-customers or increasing sales to our existing end-customers
and our business may be adversely affected.
●
Unless we continue to develop
better market awareness of our company and our software solutions, and to improve lead generation and sales enablement, our revenue
may not continue to grow.
●
We face competition in
our market and we may not maintain or improve our competitive position.
●
If our new software solutions
and enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance, our results of operations and competitive position will suffer.
11

●
If functionality similar
to that offered by our software solutions is incorporated into our competitors’ existing network infrastructures, our customers
may decide against adding our appliances to their network, which would have an adverse effect on our business.
●
Because some of the key
components in our network server come from limited sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages, long or uncertain lead
times for components, and supply changes, each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled software deliveries to our customers,
result in inventory shortage, cause loss of sales and customers or increase component costs resulting in lower gross margins and
free cash flow.
●
The sales prices of our
hardware and software solutions may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and operating margin and may adversely impact our
financial results and the trading price of our common stock.
●
The network security market
is rapidly evolving and the complex technologies incorporated in our software solutions make them difficult to develop. If we do
not accurately predict, prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing end-customer needs,
our competitive position and prospects may be harmed.

If our internal enterprise
IT networks, on which we conduct internal business and interface externally, our operational networks, through which we connect to
customers, vendors and partners systems and provide services, or our R&D networks, our back-end labs and cloud stacks hosted
in our data centers, colocation vendors or public cloud providers, through which we research, develop and host software solutions
are compromised, public perception of our offerings may be harmed, our customers may be breached and harmed, we may become subject
to liability, and our business, operating results and stock price may be adversely impacted.
●
Our proprietary rights
may be difficult to enforce and we may be subject to claims by others that we infringe their propriety technology.
●
Claims by others that we
infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business.
●
Failure to comply with
laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose end-customers
in the public sector or negatively impact our ability to contract with the public sector.
●
We are subject to governmental
export and import controls that could subject us to liability or restrictions on sales, and that could impair our ability to compete
in international markets.
12
●
Investors’ expectations
of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.
●
We have incurred indebtedness
and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.
●
If our estimates or judgments
relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results
could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.
●
We are affected by fluctuations
in currency exchange rates, including those in connection with recent inflationary trends in the United States.
●
We could be subject to
changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, exposure to additional tax liabilities or impacts
from the timing of tax payments.
●
Forecasting our estimated
annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and there may be material differences between our forecasted and
actual tax rates.
●
As a public company, we
will be subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased
costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
●
If securities or industry
analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume
could decline.
●
Global economic uncertainty,
an economic downturn, the possibility of a recession, inflation, rising interest rates, weakening software demand caused by political
instability, changes in trade agreements and conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, could adversely affect our business and financial
performance.
●
Changes in financial accounting
standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.

bans, and requirements for local manufacture.
Any
one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in
our quarterly financial and other operating results. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal
operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations
for these or any other reasons, the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits, including
securities class action suits. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact
on margins in the short term.
We
rely heavily on our reselling partners and our ability to work with suitable partners may impact our growth plans.
Within
our partner network, our three and two largest reselling partners accounted for over 53.8% of our total revenues in our fiscal year ended
March 31, 2025, and 49.5% of our total revenues in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, respectively. We continue to engage with new
partners and expand our existing relationships to mitigate customer concentration risk. Additionally, we are in discussions with multiple
potential partners in Southeast Asia to address the Southeast Asia market and there are no assurances we will find a suitable qualified
partners.
If
we are unable to develop and introduce new software solutions and improve existing software solutions in a cost-effective and timely
manner, then our competitive position may be negatively impacted and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may
be adversely affected.
If
we are unable to adapt to rapidly evolving technological advancements and market demands within the enterprise network software sector,
our competitive position could be undermined, leading to adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The network software industry is characterized by swift changes in customer preferences, emerging security threats, and evolving performance
expectations. Failing to anticipate and address these shifts could result in our solutions becoming outdated or less effective, which
may cause customers to seek alternatives from our competitors. Additionally, the complex nature of SD-WAN, SASE, and SIEM solutions demand
continuous R&D efforts to ensure compatibility with new networking protocols, hardware platforms, and cloud architectures. Delays
or inefficiencies in the development processes could hinder our ability to capture new market opportunities and retain existing customers.
Therefore, our inability to proactively develop and introduce innovative solutions, as well as enhance our existing offerings, could
weaken our competitive stance and negatively impact our overall business prospects.
We
invest significantly in research and development, and to the extent our research and development efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive
position may be negatively impacted and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.
Our
success depends heavily on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced R&D personnel. The network software industry
is marked by rapid technological advancements, evolving market trends, and intense competition. If we fail to effectively recruit and
retain top-tier R&D personnel, our capacity to innovate, develop new solutions, and enhance existing software solutions may be compromised.
Competition for skilled engineers and developers is strong, and an inability to assemble a proficient R&D team could hinder our ability
to respond promptly to market demands and stay ahead of technological shifts. Though we mitigate this with our robust talent development
pipeline, a shortage of qualified candidates may negatively impact our performance. Furthermore, if key R&D personnel were to leave
or if we encounter challenges in maintaining a collaborative and innovative work environment, our research outcomes might suffer, negatively
impacting the quality and speed of our software development. In such scenarios, our competitive standing could weaken, potentially leading
to a decline in market share, revenue, and overall business performance.
16
We
operate in a highly competitive market.
The
intense competition within our market poses a risk to our business operations, financial performance, and overall market position. Our
industry is comprised of a number of players, including both established companies and emerging startups. As a result, we face pressure
to differentiate our offerings, maintain competitive pricing, and consistently deliver high-quality solutions. If we fail to navigate
this competitive landscape, we could experience challenges in acquiring new customers, expanding our market share, and retaining existing
customers. Furthermore, the emergence of new competitors or the rapid advancement of alternative technologies could disrupt our current
business model. Therefore, our ability to successfully compete is critical to our long-term success.
Increases
in costs of the materials and other components that we use in our solutions would adversely affect our business, results of operations,
and financial condition.
Fluctuations
or increases in the costs of materials and components to our hardware or software solutions pose a risk to our business. When customers
cannot host our software solutions, we procure hardware components to deploy to customer sites. Any significant rise in these costs,
whether due to supply chain disruptions, market volatility, or external factors, could lead to elevated production expenses and impact
our profit margins or customer demand if the cost is passed on. Failure to manage and mitigate these cost pressures could impact profitability
or revenue. Additionally, if we are unable to adapt to changing cost dynamics, it could impede our ability to invest in R&D or expansion
efforts, further limiting our growth prospects. Therefore, our capability to effectively manage material and component costs is a factor
in our operational resilience and long-term financial success.
Adverse
economic conditions, such as a possible recession and possible impacts of inflation or stagflation, increasing or decreasing interest
rates, reduced information technology spending or any economic downturn or recession, may adversely impact our business.
Our
business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers.
In addition, the purchase of our software solutions is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other
resources. Weak global and regional economic conditions, fluctuating spending environments, a potential recession, the effects of ongoing
or increased inflation, possible stagflation in certain geographies, variable interest rates, geopolitical instability and uncertainty,
a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macroeconomic conditions, the effects of epidemics and pandemics, and the
impact of the war in Ukraine each could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and our business.
Our inability to mitigate any of the foregoing events may result in longer sales cycles, a decrease in prices of our software solutions,
increased component costs, higher default rates among our channel partners, reduced unit sales, or a decline in growth.
The
existence of inflation in certain economies has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increasing or decreasing interest rates and
capital costs, increased component or shipping costs, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates and other similar effects. We
may not be able to successfully mitigate these risks in a timely manner. These economic challenges may also adversely impact spending
patterns by our distributors, resellers and end-customers.
Our
billings, revenue and free cash flow growth may slow or may not continue, and our operating margins may decline.
We
may experience slowing growth or a decrease in billings, revenue, operating margin and free cash flow for a number of reasons, including
a slowdown in demand for our hardware or software solutions, a shift in demand from hardware to software solutions, decrease in revenue
growth, increased competition, worldwide or regional economic challenges based on inflation or possible stagflation, a regional or global
recession, rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine, a decrease in the growth of our overall market or softness in demand in certain
geographies or industry verticals, such as the service provider industry, changes in our strategic opportunities, execution risks, lower
sales productivity and our failure for any reason to continue to capitalize on sales and growth opportunities due to other risks identified
in the risk factors described in this prospectus. Our expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, may be higher than expected if our
revenue is lower than expected. If our investments in sales and marketing and other functional areas do not result in expected billings
and revenue growth, we may experience margin declines. In addition, we may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if
we fail to increase billings, revenue or deferred revenue, and do not appropriately manage our cost structure, free cash flow, or encounter
unanticipated liabilities. As a result, any failure by us to maintain profitability and margins and continue our billings, revenue and
free cash flow growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline.
17
We
are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management, the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our
business, operating results and financial condition.
Our
future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business
plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and software solutions. The loss of services of members of senior management, or of
any of our senior sales leaders or functional area leaders, could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and
strategic objectives. The loss of the services or the distraction of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Dr.
Bhaskar and Ms. Datta are the primary inventors of our Company’s technology and have been instrumental in developing key partnerships.
While our management team also supports the continuing operations, our two founders continue to play a key role in the company and in
developing new ideas and building new partnerships.
If
we are unable to attract, retain, and motivate key employees, then our business, results of operations, and financial condition would
be adversely affected.
Hiring
and retaining qualified executives, developers, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business. The
competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is increasingly intense. Competitors for technical talent increasingly may seek
to hire our employees. Changes in the interpretation and application of employment-related laws to our workforce practices may also result
in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. To help attract, retain, and motivate
qualified employees, we intend to use employee incentives such as share-based awards. Our employee hiring and retention also depend on
our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. If our share-based
or other compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate
employees would be weakened, which would harm our results of operations. Equity compensation has been, and will continue to be, an important
part of our future compensation strategy and a significant component of our future expenses, which we expect to increase over time. Moreover,
sustained declines in our stock price can reduce the retention value of our share-based awards. If we do not effectively hire, onboard,
retain, and motivate key employees, then our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.
Changes
in our management team can also disrupt our business. Our management and senior leadership team has significant industry experience,
and their knowledge and relationships would be difficult to replace. Leadership changes may occur from time to time, and we cannot predict
whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit qualified personnel.
We
may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
A
majority of our operating expenses are for sales and marketing, and R&D activities. Our capital requirements will depend on many
factors, including, but not limited to:
●
technological
advancements;
●
market
acceptance of our solutions and solution enhancements, and the overall level of sales of our software solutions;
●
R&D
expenses;
●
our
relationships with our customers and partners;
●
our
ability to control costs;
●
sales
and marketing expenses;
●
enhancements
to our infrastructure and systems and any capital improvements to our facilities;
●
working
capital for inventory;
●
potential
acquisitions of businesses and product lines; and
●
general
economic conditions, including, inflation, rising interest rates, and international conflicts and their impact on the tech industry
in particular.
18
If
our capital requirements are materially different from those currently planned, we may need additional capital sooner than anticipated.
If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders may be diluted. Additional
financing may not be available on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available
on acceptable terms, we may be unable to continue our operations as planned, develop or enhance our solutions, expand our sales and marketing
programs, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures.
Risks
Related to Our Sales and End-Customers
If
we do not increase the effectiveness of our sales organization, we may have difficulty adding new end-customers or increasing sales to
our existing end-customers and our business may be adversely affected.
Although
we have a channel sales model, sales in our industry are complex and members of our sales organization often engage in direct interaction
with our prospective end-customers, particularly for larger deals involving larger end-customers. Therefore, we continue to be substantially
dependent on our sales organization to obtain new end-customers and sell additional software solutions and services to our existing end-customers.
There is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require, including experienced enterprise
sales employees and others. Our ability to grow our revenue depends, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining
sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth and on the effectiveness of our sales strategy, sales execution, and sales
personnel selling successfully in different contexts, each of which has its own different complexities, approaches and competitive landscapes,
such as managing and growing the channel business for sales to small businesses and more actively selling to the end-customer for sales
to larger organizations. New hires require substantial training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity.
Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient
numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. Furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new
countries requires additional setup and upfront costs that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity.
If our sales employees do not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected, our revenue may not increase at anticipated
levels and our ability to achieve long-term projections may be negatively impacted. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers
of effective sales personnel, the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new end-customers or increasing sales to our existing
customer base or sales personnel do not effectively sell our Enhanced Platform Technology software solutions, our business, operating
results and prospects may be adversely affected. If we do not hire properly qualified and effective sales employees and organize our
sales team effectively to capture the opportunities in the various customer segments we are targeting, our growth and ability to effectively
support growth may be harmed.
19
In
addition, in light of macroeconomic trends and in the event of sales execution challenges for any reason, we may face excess sales capacity,
low sales productivity generally, and a decline in productivity in our sales organization. If we are not able to align our sales capacity
and market demand, or if the productivity of our sales organization decreases, our operating results and financial condition could be
harmed.
Unless
we continue to develop better market awareness of our company and our software solutions, and to improve lead generation and sales enablement,
our revenue may not continue to grow.
Increased
market awareness of our capabilities and software services and increased lead generation are essential to our continued growth and our
success in all of our markets, particularly the market for sales to large businesses, service providers and government organizations.
While we have increased our investments in sales and marketing, it is not clear that these investments will continue to result in increased
revenue. If our investments in additional sales personnel or our marketing programs are not successful in continuing to create market
awareness of our company and software solutions or increasing lead generation, in growing billings for our broad software solutions or
if we experience turnover and disruption in our sales and marketing teams, we may not be able to achieve sustained growth, and our business,
financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
Risks
Related to Our Industry, Customers, Software and Services
We
face competition in our market and we may not maintain or improve our competitive position.
The
market for network security software solutions is competitive and dynamic and we expect to face competitors across different cybersecurity
markets.
Some
of our existing and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as:
●
greater
name recognition and/or longer operating histories;
●
larger
sales and marketing budgets and resources;
●
broader
distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and end-customers;
●
access
to larger customer bases;
●
greater
customer support resources;
●
greater
resources to make acquisitions;
●
stronger
U.S. government relationships;
●
lower
labor and development costs; and
●
substantially
greater financial, technical and other resources.
In
addition, certain of our larger competitors have broader product offerings, and leverage their relationships based on other products
or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our software solutions. These
larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus, and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction
in capital spending by end-customers in these markets. Therefore, these competitors will not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular
market. Also, many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of security threat are often
able to deliver these specialized security products to the market more quickly than we can.
20
Conditions
in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation. Our
competitors and potential competitors may also be able to develop products or services, and leverage new business models, that are equal
or superior to ours, achieve greater market acceptance of their products and services, disrupt our markets, and increase sales by utilizing
different distribution channels than we do. In addition, current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater
available resources, and new competitors may arise pursuant to acquisitions of network security companies or divisions. As a result of
such acquisitions, competition in our market may continue to increase and our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt
more quickly to new technologies and customer needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services,
initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily, or develop and
expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do. In addition, our competitors may bundle products and services competitive
with ours with other products and services. Customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing
our software solutions and services. As our customers refresh the security products bought in prior years, they may seek to consolidate
vendors, which may result in current customers choosing to purchase products from our competitors on an ongoing basis. Due to budget
constraints or economic downturns, organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security
infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions. These competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete
effectively may result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share.
If
our new software solutions and enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance, our results of operations and competitive position
will suffer.
We
spend substantial amounts of time and money to internally develop software solutions and enhance versions of our software in order to
incorporate additional features, improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers’ rapidly evolving
demands for network security in our highly competitive industry. When we develop a software solution, or an enhanced version of an existing
software, we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market, promote and sell the new offering. Therefore, when we develop
and introduce new or enhanced software solutions, they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of
our investment in developing and bringing them to market.
Our
new hardware, software solutions or enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:
●
delays
in releasing our new hardware, software solutions or enhancements to the market;
●
failure
to accurately predict market demand in terms of hardware and software functionality and to supply hardware and software solutions
that meet this demand in a timely fashion;
●
failure
to have the appropriate R&D expertise and focus to make our top strategic software solutions successful;
●
failure
of our sales force and partners to focus on selling new hardware and software solutions;
●
inability
to interoperate effectively with the networks or applications of our prospective end-customers;
●
inability
to protect against new types of attacks or techniques used by hackers;
●
actual
or perceived defects, vulnerabilities, errors or failures;
●
negative
publicity about their performance or effectiveness;
●
introduction
or anticipated introduction of competing products and services by our competitors;
●
poor
business conditions for our end-customers, causing them to delay IT purchases;
●
changes
to the regulatory requirements around security; and
●
reluctance
of customers to purchase software solutions that incorporate open-source software.
If
our new hardware, software solutions or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position will
be impaired, our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant
research, development, marketing, sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with our offerings.
21
Demand
for our software solutions may be limited by market perception that individual software solutions from one vendor that provide multiple
layers of security protection in one offering are inferior to point solution network security solutions from multiple vendors.
Sales
of many of our software solutions depend on increased demand for incorporating broad security functionality into one application. If
the market for these solutions fails to grow as we anticipate, our business will be negatively impacted. Target customers may view “all-in-one”
network security solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors based on their perception that security functions
from one vendor restrict users from choosing amongst the wide range of dedicated security applications available. Target customers might
also perceive that, by combining multiple security functions into a single platform, our solutions create a “single point of failure”
in their networks, which means that an error, vulnerability or failure of our offerings may place the entire network at risk. In addition,
the market perception that “all-in-one” solutions may be suitable only for small and medium-sized businesses because such
solution lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large businesses, service provider
and government organization end-customers. If the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent, even if there is no factual basis
for these concerns and perceptions, or if other issues arise with our market in general, demand for multi-security functionality software
solutions could be severely limited, which would limit our growth and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Further, a successful and publicized targeted attack against us, exposing a “single point of failure”, could significantly
increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations.
If
functionality similar to that offered by our software solutions is incorporated into our competitors’ existing network infrastructure
products, our customers may decide against adding our appliances to their network, which would have an adverse effect on our business.
Large,
well-established providers of networking equipment and may continue to introduce, network security features that compete with our software
solutions, either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products. The inclusion of,
or the announcement of an intent to include, functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions that are
already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell
our software solutions. Furthermore, even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our software
solutions, a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional
vendor such as us. Many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks
and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products, which may make them reluctant to add new components
to their networks, particularly from other vendors such as us. If organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure
from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors, our business, financial condition and results of operations
will be adversely affected.
Because
some of the key components in our hardware come from limited sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages, long or uncertain
lead times for components, and supply changes, each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled software deliveries to our customers,
result in inventory shortage, cause loss of sales and customers or increase component costs resulting in lower gross margins and free
cash flow.
Our
contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components for our hardware from limited sources of supply. We are therefore
subject to the risk of shortages or uncertain lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers may
discontinue or modify components used in our software. We have in the past experienced uncertain lead times for certain components. The
introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products, particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers,
could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our solutions. In addition, if these suppliers
were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component, we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating
and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor. Qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components
can be time-consuming and expensive.
22
If
we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of hardware, we may have to find alternate sources. This could result in a delay and cancellation
of orders, lost sales, reduced gross margins or damage to our end-customer relationships, which would adversely impact our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additionally, if actual demand does not directly match with our demand forecasts,
due to our purchase order commitments, we could be required to accept or pay for components and finished goods. This may result in us
discounting our hardware or excess or obsolete inventory, which we would be required to write down to its estimated realizable value,
which in turn could result in lower gross margins. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks, including:
●
a
potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required parts or components when required;
●
financial
or other difficulties faced by our suppliers;
●
infringement
or misappropriation of our intellectual property (“IP”);
●
price
increases;
●
failure
of a component to meet environmental or other regulatory requirements;
●
failure
to meet delivery obligations in a timely fashion;
●
failure
in component quality; and
●
inability
to deliver software on a timely basis.
The
occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business. Any interruption or delay in the supply
of any of these parts or components, or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices
and within a reasonable amount of time, would harm our ability to meet our scheduled hardware deliveries to our distributors, resellers
and end-customers. This could harm our relationships with our channel partners and end-customers and could cause delays in the installation
of our software solutions and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, increased component costs could result in lower
gross margins.
The
sales prices of our hardware and software solutions may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and operating margin and may adversely
impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock.
The
sales prices for our software solutions may decline for a variety of reasons or the mix of our offerings may change, resulting in lower
growth and margins based on a number of factors, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts or promotional programs we offer,
a change in our available offerings and anticipation of the introduction of new software solutions. We have recently conducted such price
decreases. Competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate, and we expect competition to further increase
in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the
price of products and services that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or services or may bundle them with
other products or services. Additionally, although we price our software solutions and services worldwide in U.S. dollars, currency fluctuations
in certain countries and regions have in the past, and may in the future, negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers
are willing to pay in those countries and regions. Furthermore, we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our hardware
and software solutions will decrease over product life cycles. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in developing and introducing
new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis, or that those offerings, if introduced, will enable us to maintain our prices,
gross profits and operating margin at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability.
23
The
network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our software solutions make them difficult to
develop. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing end-customer
needs, our competitive position and prospects may be harmed.
The
network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly. Moreover, many of our end-customers operate in markets characterized
by rapidly changing technologies and business plans, which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly
complex networks, incorporating a variety of hardware, software applications, operating systems and networking protocols. In addition,
computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems
and networks. The technology in our software solutions is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to
new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, while minimizing the impact on network performance. Additionally, some of our new
offerings and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures that involve complex, expensive and time-consuming R&D
processes. Although the market expects rapid introduction of new software solutions and to respond to new threats, the development of
these solutions is difficult, the timetable for their commercial release and availability is uncertain, and there can be long time periods
between releases and availability of new software solutions. We have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays
in the availability of new offerings and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability. If we do not quickly respond
to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our end-customers by developing, releasing and making available on a timely basis new software
solutions or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats, our competitive position and business prospects may be
harmed.
Our
ability to sell our software solutions is dependent on our quality control processes and the quality of our technical support services,
and our failure to offer high-quality technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
Once
our software solutions are deployed within our end-customers’ networks, our end-customers depend on our technical support services,
as well as the support of our partners and other third parties, to resolve any issues relating to our software. If we, our partners,
or other third-parties do not effectively assist our customers in planning, deploying and operating our software, successfully help our
customers resolve post-deployment issues, or provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional software solutions to
existing customers may be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. Many large end-customers,
and service providers or government organization end-customers, require higher levels of support than smaller end-customers because of
their more complex deployments and more demanding environments and business models. If we, our channel partners or other third parties
fail to meet the requirements of our larger end-customers, it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration
with large businesses, service providers and government organizations. Our failure to maintain high-quality support services could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may subject us to litigation, reputational
damage, loss of customers and additional costs.
Our
business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns, product liability and software defects.
Our
software solutions are complex and, despite testing prior to their release, have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors,
especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Software errors have affected the performance and effectiveness of
our software solutions and could delay the development or release of new offerings or new versions of our software. This may adversely
affect our reputation and our end-customers’ willingness to buy software from us, result in litigation and disputes with customers,
and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our software solutions. Any such errors or delays in releasing new software solutions
or new versions of our software or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase
our service costs, cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning our software, cause us to lose significant end-customers, subject
us to litigation, litigation costs and liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our software solutions must successfully interoperate
with products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these
problems. The occurrence of hardware and software errors, whether or not caused by our offerings, could delay or reduce market acceptance
of our software solutions and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance, and any necessary revisions may cause
us to incur significant expenses. The occurrence of any such problems could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
24
Although
we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale and back-to-back warranty from our
hardware vendors, they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims if exceptions apply or if the provisions are deemed unenforceable,
and in some circumstances, we may be required to indemnify a customer in full, without limitation, for certain liabilities, including
liabilities that are not contractually limited. The sale and support of our software solutions also entail the risk of product liability
claims. We maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our software, but our insurance coverage may
not adequately cover any claim asserted against us, if at all, and in some instances may subject us to potential liability that is not
contractually limited. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation
and divert management’s time and other resources.
Our
historical financial information may not be representative of our results as a public company.
The
historical combined financial information included in this prospectus may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows in the future or what they would have been had we been a public company during the fiscal years presented. Our
historical financial data presented in this prospectus includes costs of our business, which may not, however, reflect the expenses we
would have incurred as a public company for the fiscal years presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if we had operated as
a public company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, the outsourcing of certain functions,
and other strategic decisions.
Risks
Related to Our Systems and Technology
If
our internal enterprise IT networks, on which we conduct internal business and interface externally, our operational networks, through
which we connect to customers, vendors and partners systems and provide services, or our research and development networks, our back-end
labs and cloud stacks hosted in our data centers, colocation vendors or public cloud providers, through which we research, develop and
host software solutions are compromised, public perception of our offerings may be harmed, our customers may be breached and harmed,
we may become subject to liability, and our business, operating results and stock price may be adversely impacted.
Our
success depends on the market’s confidence in our ability to provide effective network security protection. Despite our efforts
and processes to prevent breaches of our internal networks, systems and websites, we are still vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins,
phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service, vulnerabilities in vendor hardware and
software that we leverage, advanced persistent threats from sophisticated actors and other cyber-attacks and similar disruptions from
unauthorized access to our internal networks, systems or websites. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error,
malfeasance or otherwise, which breaches may be more difficult to detect than outsider threats, and the existing programs and trainings
we have in place to prevent such insider threats may not be effective or sufficient. Third parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce
our employees to transfer funds or disclose information in order to gain access to our networks and confidential information. Third parties
may also send our customers or others malware or malicious emails that falsely indicate that we are the source, potentially causing lost
confidence in us and reputational harm. We cannot guarantee that the measures we have taken to protect our networks, systems and websites
will provide adequate security. Moreover, because we provide network security software, we may be a more attractive target for attacks
by computer hackers and any security breaches and other security incidents involving us may result in more harm to our reputation and
brand than companies that do not sell network security solutions. Hackers and malicious parties may be able to develop and deploy viruses,
worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our software and customers’ data and privacy, that impersonate
our update servers in an effort to access customer networks and negatively impact customers, or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities
of our software, or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, customers or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information
or unwittingly provide access to our internal networks, systems or data.
Although
we take numerous measures and implement multiple layers of security to protect our networks, we cannot guarantee that our security software,
processes and services will secure against all threats. Further, we cannot be sure that third parties have not been, or will not in the
future be, successful in improperly accessing our systems and our customers’ systems, which could negatively impact us and our
customers. An actual breach could significantly harm us and our customers, and an actual or perceived breach, or any other actual or
perceived data security incident, threat or vulnerability, that involves our supply chains, networks, systems or websites and/or our
customers’ supply chains, networks, systems or websites could adversely affect the market perception of our software and services
and investor confidence in our company. We could also be subject to liability and litigation and reputational harm and our partners and
end-customers may be harmed, lose confidence in us and decrease or cease using our software solutions and services. Any breach of our
internal networks, systems or websites could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.
25
Our
business and operations have experienced growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable
to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely affected.
We
have experienced growth and increased demand for our software solutions and subscriptions since 2020. As we have grown, our number of
end-customers has increased, and we have managed more complex deployments of our software solutions and subscriptions with larger end-customers.
The growth and expansion of our business and software, subscriptions, and support offerings places a significant strain on our management,
operational, and financial resources. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information
technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount,
capital, and processes in an efficient manner.
We
may not be able to successfully implement, scale, or manage improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely
manner, which could result in material disruptions of our operations and business. In addition, our existing systems, processes, and
controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud. We may also experience difficulties in managing improvements to our
systems, processes, and controls, or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us with such improvements. Any future growth
would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization. Failure to manage any future
growth effectively could result in increased costs, disrupt our existing end-customer relationships, reduce demand for or limit us to
smaller deployments of our software, or materially harm our business performance and operating results.
Risks
Related to Our Intellectual Property
Our
proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce and we may be subject to claims by others that we infringe their propriety technology.
We
rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect
our technology. Valid patents may not issue from our pending applications, and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be
sufficiently broad to protect our technology or software. Any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and any
rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us. Patent applications
in the United States are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing, or, in some cases, not at all, and publications
of discoveries in industry-related literature lag behind actual discoveries. We cannot be certain that we were the first to make the
inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection. Additionally, the process
of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent
applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. In addition, recent changes to the patent laws in the United States may bring
into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications. As
a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents.
26
Despite
our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our software or obtain and use information
that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors
and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot guarantee that the steps
taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. Policing unauthorized use of our technology or software is difficult. In
addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States,
and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States. From
time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other IP rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine
the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation
could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial
condition. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights (including aspects of our software protected other than by patent rights),
we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense, time and effort required to
create the innovative software that have enabled us to be successful to date.
Further,
our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology.
Our policy is to obtain appropriate proprietary rights protection for any potentially significant new technology acquired or developed
by us. We hold 13 U.S. patents, and provisional patent filings.
In
addition to patent laws, we rely on copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade
secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with channel partners, distributors, other customers and suppliers, proprietary
information agreements with our employees and consultants, and other similar measures. Our primary trademarks are for our name and software
names. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary rights. While we believe our patents, patent applications,
software and other proprietary know-how have value, changing technology makes our future success dependent principally upon our ability
to successfully achieve continuing innovation.
Litigation
may be necessary in the future to enforce our proprietary rights, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others,
or to defend us against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. An adverse outcome in such litigation or similar proceedings
could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from others or require us to cease
marketing or using certain software, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results
of operations. In addition, the cost of addressing any IP litigation claim, both in legal fees and expenses, as well as from the diversion
of management’s resources, regardless of whether the claim is valid, could be significant and could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Claims
by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business.
Patent
and other IP disputes are common in the software related technology industry. As the number of products and competitors in our market
increases and overlaps occur, infringement claims may increase. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit,
could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business. In addition,
litigation may involve patent holding companies, non-practicing entities or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product
revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection.
Although
third parties may offer a license to their technology, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable, and the failure to obtain
a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be materially
and adversely affected. In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology
licensed to us.
Alternatively,
we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, effort and expense, and may ultimately
not be successful. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from providing
certain software solutions that requires us to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed
such claimant’s patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
27
Other
Risks Related to Our Business and Financial Position
Failure
to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose
end-customers in the public sector or negatively impact our ability to contract with the public sector.
Our
business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, regional, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible
for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery
laws, data privacy laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions,
these regulatory requirements may vary from those in the United States. Non-compliance with applicable regulations or requirements could
subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages and civil and criminal penalties
or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our
business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result
in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and
sanctions could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
Selling
our solutions to the U.S. government, whether directly or through channel partners, also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual
requirements, government permit and clearance requirements and other risks. Failure to comply with these requirements or to obtain and
maintain government permits and clearances required to do certain business, by either us or our channel partners, could subject us to
investigations, fines, suspension, limitations on business or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government or one of its divisions,
as well as other penalties, damages and reputational harms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial
condition and prospects. Any violations of regulatory and contractual requirements could result in us being suspended or debarred from
future government contracting. Any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our revenue, operating results, financial condition
and prospects.
These
laws, regulations and other requirements impose added costs on our business, and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations
and requirements, including non-compliance in the past, could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners, penalties, termination
of contracts, loss of exclusive rights in our IP and temporary suspension, permanent debarment from government contracting, or other
limitations on doing business. Any such damages, penalties, disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with the public
sector could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.
We
are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or restrictions on sales, and that could impair
our ability to compete in international markets.
Because
we incorporate encryption technology into our software solutions, certain of our software are subject to U.S. export controls and may
be exported outside the United States only with the required export license or through an export license exception, or may be prohibited
altogether from export to certain countries. If we were to fail to comply with U.S. export laws, U.S. Customs regulations and import
regulations, U.S. economic sanctions and other countries’ import and export laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and
criminal penalties, including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of
export or import privileges. In addition, if our partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits
(e.g., for stocking orders placed by our partners), we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties and we
may not be able to provide support related to appliances shipped pursuant to such orders. Obtaining the necessary export license for
a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.
28
Furthermore,
U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries,
governments and persons, such as the sanctions and trade restrictions that have been implemented against Russia and Belarus. Even though
we take precautions to prevent our hardware from being shipped to U.S. sanctioned targets, our hardware could be shipped to those targets
by our partners, despite such precautions. Any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and
penalties and reputational harm. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including import
permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our software or could limit our
customers’ ability to implement our software solutions in those countries. Changes in our hardware and software or changes in export
and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our hardware and software solutions in international markets, or, in
some cases, prevent the export or import of our software to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export
or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change
in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our software solutions
by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our software solutions to, existing or potential customers with international operations.
Any decreased use of our hardware and software or limitation on our ability to export or sell our hardware and software would likely
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Investors’
expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to
new risks.
There
is an increasing focus from certain investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically
related to ESG matters. Some investors may use these non-financial performance factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some
cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies and actions relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate. The
growing investor demand for measurement of non-financial performance is addressed by third-party providers of sustainability assessment
and ratings on companies. The criteria by which our corporate responsibility practices are assessed may change due to the constant evolution
of the sustainability landscape, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy
such new criteria. If we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria, investors may conclude that our policies and/or actions
with respect to corporate social responsibility are inadequate. We may face reputational damage in the event that we do not meet the
ESG standards set by various constituencies.
If
we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as
planned, our reputation and business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, the SEC has
also proposed a draft rule that requires climate disclosures in financial filings. To the extent the SEC proposal becomes effective for
our Company, we will be required to establish additional internal controls, engage additional consultants and incur additional costs
related to evaluating, managing and reporting on our environmental impact and climate-related risks and opportunities. If we fail to
implement sufficient oversight or accurately capture and disclose on environmental matters, our reputation, business, operating results
and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
We
have incurred indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial
results.
As
of March 31, 2025, we incurred an aggregate of $5,000,000 of indebtedness outstanding under the Fortis Bank replacement loan.
Under
the agreements governing our indebtedness, we are permitted to incur additional debt. This debt, and any debt that we may incur in the
future, may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:
●
increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, competitive pressures, and adverse economic and industry conditions;
●
requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of
expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions; and
●
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and our industries;
If
we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required, among other things,
to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected
assets or reduce or delay planned capital, operating or investment expenditures. Such measures may not be sufficient to enable us to
service our debt.
The
repayment obligations under the outstanding debt may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover of our company.
If we were required to pay the note prior to their scheduled maturity, it could have a negative impact on our cash position and liquidity
and impair our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives.
In
addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our debt, as well as affect
our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may negatively impact the terms of any such financing.
29
Risks
Related to Finance, Accounting and Tax Matters
If
our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect,
our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided
in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates.” Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances
differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and
investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our condensed consolidated
financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, deferred contract costs and commission expense, accounting for business
combinations, contingent liabilities and accounting for income taxes.
We
are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including those in connection with recent inflationary trends in the United
States.
We
are exposed to both adverse and advantageous movements in currency exchange rates. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and we
incur financial expenses in connection with fluctuations in value due to foreign exchange differences between our monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in United States dollars and, to a much lesser extent, the Indian Rupee, and other currencies. Although most
of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, and our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a portion of our payroll and other operating
expenses are accrued in Indian Rupees. An increase in the value of the dollar will increase the real cost to our customers of our solutions
in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars. Changes in exchange rates would adversely affect our business, results of
operations, and financial condition.
We
could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, exposure to additional tax liabilities
or impacts from the timing of tax payments.
We
are subject to taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and
could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control. These include:
●
the
mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or withholding taxes;
●
changes
in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;
●
transfer
pricing adjustments;
●
increases
to corporate tax rates;
●
changes
in availability of tax credits and/or tax deductions;
●
the
timing of tax payments;
●
tax
costs related to intercompany realignments;
●
tax
assessments resulting from income tax audits or any related tax interest or penalties that could significantly affect our provision
for income taxes for the period in which the settlement takes place; and
●
changes
in accounting principles, court decisions, tax rulings, and interpretations of or changes to tax laws, and regulations by international,
federal or local governmental authorities.
Significant
judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation
allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility
of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized,
we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination
is made.
30
Forecasting
our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and there may be material differences between our forecasted
and actual tax rates.
Forecasts
of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex, subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position
for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range
of income tax rates, as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the impact of various accounting rules
and changes to these rules and tax laws, the results of examinations by various tax authorities, and the impact of any acquisition, business
combination or other reorganization or financing transaction. To forecast our global tax rate, we estimate our pre-tax profits and losses
by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction. If the mix of profits and losses, our ability to use tax credits or our
effective tax rate in a given jurisdiction differs from our estimate, our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted,
which could have a material impact on our results of business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our actual
tax rate may be subject to further uncertainty due to potential changes in U.S. and foreign tax rules.
The
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”), an international association comprised of 38 countries,
including the United States, has issued and continues to issue guidelines and proposals that change various aspects of the existing framework
under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. Due to our extensive international business
activities, any changes in the taxation of such activities could increase our tax obligations in many countries and may increase our
worldwide effective tax rate.
Risks
Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock
As
a public company, we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly
increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”), Dodd-Frank and other rules implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market
impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. These requirements, as
well as proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration, may further increase our compliance costs. If compliance
with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns, it could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Sarbanes-Oxley requires, among other things,
that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually, and of our disclosure controls and procedures
quarterly. Although our most recent assessment, testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that, as of March 31, 2024, our internal
controls over financial reporting were effective, we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in 2025 or future periods and there can
be no assurance that, in the future, our internal controls over financial reporting will be effective or deemed effective. The Company
has put in place internal procedures to conduct secondary reviews of financial statements and enhanced internal controls. We may incur
additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations, both of which could materially
increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results.
If
securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock
price and trading volume could decline.
The
trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about
us or our business. If we do not maintain adequate research coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock
or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or if our results or forecasts fail to meet the expectations of research
analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish
reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. If securities
analysts publish inaccurate positive information, stockholders could buy our stock and the stock price may later decline.
31
General
Risks
Global
economic uncertainty, an economic downturn, the possibility of a recession, inflation, rising interest rates, weakening product demand
caused by political instability, changes in trade agreements and conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, could adversely affect our business
and financial performance.
Economic
uncertainty in various global markets caused by political instability and conflict, such as the war in Ukraine, and economic challenges
caused by the economic downturn, any resulting recession, inflation or rise in interest rates has resulted, and may continue to result,
in weakened demand for our software solutions and difficulty in forecasting our financial results. Political developments impacting government
spending and international trade, including potential government shutdowns and trade disputes and tariffs may negatively impact markets
and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions. The effects of these events may continue due to potential U.S. government shutdowns and the
transition in administrations, and the United States’ ongoing trade disputes with Russia, China and other countries. The continuing
effect of any or all of these events could adversely impact demand for our software solutions, harm our operations and weaken our financial
results.
In
addition, the U.S. capital markets have experienced and continue to experience extreme volatility and disruption. Inflation rates in
the United States significantly increased in 2023 resulting in federal action to increase interest rates, adversely affecting capital
markets activity. Further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment and regulatory action may adversely affect our business, operating
results and financial condition. Moreover, there has been recent turmoil in the global banking system. For example, in March 2023, Silicon
Valley Bank (“SVB”) was put into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and subsequently sold. Other banks
at risk of failure have been subsequently sold, including First Republic Bank in May 2023, and there is concern that more banks could
be at risk of the same fate. Continued instability in the global banking system may negatively impact us or our customers, including
our customers’ ability to pay for our platform, and adversely impact our business and financial condition. Moreover, events such
as the closure of SVB, in addition to global macroeconomic conditions discussed above, may cause further turbulence and uncertainty in
the capital markets and economy.
Changes
in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.
A
change in accounting standards or practices, and varying interpretations of existing or new accounting pronouncements, as well as significant
costs incurred or that may be incurred to adopt and to comply with these new pronouncements, could have a significant effect on our reported
financial results or the way we conduct our business. If we do not ensure that our systems and processes are aligned with the new standards,
we could encounter difficulties generating quarterly and annual financial statements in a timely manner, which could have an adverse
effect on our business, our ability to meet our reporting obligations and compliance with internal control requirements.
Management
will continue to make judgments and assumptions based on our interpretation of new standards. If our circumstances change or if actual
circumstances differ from our assumptions, our operating results may be adversely affected and could fall below our publicly announced
guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock. Further,
marketable equity investments are required to be measured at fair value (with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income),
which may increase the volatility of our earnings.

3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In
the ordinary course of business, we may become a party to lawsuits involving various matters. The impact and outcome of litigation, if
any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm
our business. We believe the ultimate resolution of any such current proceeding will not have a material adverse effect on our continued
financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except as otherwise set forth below. However, assessment of the current litigation
or other legal claims could change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known to the Company or by judges, juries or other
finders of fact, which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or
claims.
As
of the date of this Annual Report, we are not the subject of any legal proceedings that are expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Overview
FatPipe
is a pioneer in enterprise-grade, application-aware, secure SD-WAN solutions for organizations, including enterprises, communication
service providers, security service providers, government organizations, and other middle-market companies. FatPipe also develops FatPipe Total Security 360, a comprehensive cybersecurity and Security Information and Event
Management product. FatPipe announced this solution in April 2025. We sell our software solutions
to a diverse group of end-users predominately on a subscription basis, and rely on our network of distributors, value-added resellers,
ISPs, and other third parties for distribution. We typically maintain a contractual relationship directly with the end-user customer
and provide product deployment and ongoing support. We sell our products in the U.S. and South Asia.
FatPipe’s
fiscal year ends March 31st.
Components
of Results of Operations
Revenue
FatPipe
derives its revenues from the sale of its software solutions and services, which include an integrated suite of SD-WAN, security and
network management capabilities. These solutions are delivered to customers on commodity network servers, or virtually for deployment
in public, private or hybrid cloud environments. Revenues are reported net of marketing development funds provided to our distribution
partners for sales and marketing support. FatPipe Technologies, FatPipe’s subsidiary and consulting group, generally provides consulting,
staffing, and engineering services on a project basis.
The
Company launched software licenses that resulted in increased market acceptance and accelerated revenue growth. Our customer contracts
generally range from 36 – 60 months and are typically billed on a monthly basis; however, the accounting treatment varies based
on the nature of the service. The majority of our revenue is recognized at a point-in-time once the software solution has been delivered
or ownership has been transferred, and our performance obligations have been satisfied. For clarity, the Company delivers software licenses
that are valid for the duration of the contract term (i.e., 36-60 months) along with the product. Therefore, the Company recognizes the
software license revenue at the time of delivery or transfer of control. At that point, the performance obligation for the software license
has been satisfied. The contract value is recorded as contracts receivable and is transferred to accounts receivables upon invoicing
the customer. The Company’s contracts receivable is classified as accounts receivable when the Company’s right to consideration
becomes unconditional. The remaining obligation of the contract value is recorded as contract liability. Our deferred revenue consists
of the amounts from the service portion of the contract and is amortized pro-rata over the term of the service agreement. For further
details on our revenue recognition policies, please refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements incorporated in this
document.
Cost
of Revenue
The
cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the network server components, as well as the costs of cloud hosting services used
for the delivery of our software solutions and services.
Gross
Profit
Gross
profit represents the difference between revenue and cost of revenue. Cost of revenue primarily includes the cost of the network server
hardware that is used in certain instances to deliver our software solutions. Gross profit is impacted by our software solutions’
average selling price and the revenue mix between solutions and services. We do not use custom hardware and historically have not been
constrained by access to adequate supplies of hardware required to support our sales. The costs of revenue include all costs associated
with network server components as well as costs associated with providing services to our customers, including costs associated with
hosting our services through Amazon Web Services.
35
Operating
Expenses
Our
operating expenses consist of marketing and sales (M&S) expense, general and administrative (“G&A”) expense and product
development and expense. Historically, we have not capitalized any material portion of our product development expense, and we do not
have a stock-based compensation plan in place for our employees.
Marketing
and Sales Expense
Marketing
and sales expenses include the costs associated with our sales and product marketing professionals and marketing expenses in support
of our distribution partners and direct sales efforts. We incur expenses for such activities as co-marketing, trade show support, travel,
promotional materials, and product training.
General
and Administrative Expense
Our
G&A expenses primarily include the direct costs associated with corporate functions such as accounting, human resources, administrative
support, legal and professional fees, and rent and provisions for bad debt. Additionally, intangible charges, such as depreciation and
amortization expenses, are included in G&A. Depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily related to the amortization of our
intellectual property and capitalized leases. We expect that G&A expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional
personnel, improve our information technology infrastructure, and incur other costs for the compliance requirements of operating as a
public company.
Product
Development Expense
FatPipe
invests in ongoing research and development as a core component of its product innovation. These expenses consist primarily of the direct
costs of engineers and technicians who design and test our highly complex software solutions. We record all research and development
R&D expenses as incurred. Our research and development teams are primarily located at our main offices in Salt Lake City, Utah and
Chennai, India.
Operating
Results
Operating
results reflect the income from operations derived from the sale of our software solutions and services with adjustments for non-operating
income and expenses such as interest expense, interest income, and foreign exchange losses/gains resulting from our India operations.

Comparison
of for the Years Ended March 31, 2023 and 2024
Revenue
In
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, net revenue was $16,288,881, a decrease of $1,572,028, or 9%, from the prior fiscal year ended
March 31, 2024. Product and service revenue of $13,816,399 decreased by 7.91% over the prior fiscal year. The decrease in revenue
was primarily due to decreased sales of our software solutions and services due to management’s focus on the yearlong interactive process for obtaining SEC approval for the IPO. Additionally, consulting revenue decreased by $385,510
due to the timing of consulting engagements.
Cost
of Revenue
In
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, our cost of revenue was $1,061,647, a decrease of $7,927, or 0.74% from the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2024. Cost of revenue decreased as hardware product costs were lower. The cost of revenue includes costs associated with providing
services to our customers, such as costs associated with hosting our cloud services.
Gross
Profit and Gross Margin
In
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, our gross profit was $15,227,234 a decrease of $1,564,101 or 9%, from the fiscal year ended March
31, 2024. The decrease in gross profit reflects a decrease in net revenue as well as higher cost of revenue primarily attributable to
increased hardware product costs.
Our
gross margin decreased from 94% in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 to 93% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025.
Marketing
and Sales Expense
In
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, our marketing and sales expense was $3,753,948, an increase of $357,812, or 10.5%, compared to
the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to an increase in staff, advertising and other promotional efforts in the fiscal year
ended March 2025.
General
and Administrative Expense
In
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, our general and administrative expense was $3,422,596, an increase of $270,672, or 08.59%, compared
to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher professional fees, provision for cancellations, and costs related to the IPO.
Product
Development Expense
Product
development expense in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, was $1,787,128 an increase of $49,540 or 3% compared to the prior fiscal
year, as the Company continued its development plans for its cybersecurity products.
Employee
Cost Expense
Employee
cost expenses in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, were $2,791,816, a decrease of $75,544 or a 3% decrease compared to the prior
fiscal year. The decrease in employee cost expense is attributable to the decrease in professional services revenues.
Depreciation
and Amortization Expense
Depreciation
and amortization expense in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 was $545,709, a decrease of $153,548, or 22%, compared to the prior
fiscal year. These expenses are categorized under general and administrative expenses.
Non-operating
Income (Expenses)
Interest
income during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 was $42,688, an increase of $15,427, compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase
was primarily due to an increase in the interest rates on cash.
Other
income during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 was $1,831, a decrease of 205,830, or 99%, compared to the prior fiscal year due to
recovery of receivables originally set aside as potential bad debt in 2024.
Interest
expense during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 was $329,892, an increase of $27,768, or 9%, compared to the prior fiscal year. This
increase was due to the higher interest rates and the increase in the debt balance.
The
foreign exchange gain/(loss) results from currency conversion from U.S. dollars to Indian rupees.
38
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
We
believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements and plans for the next 12 months and in the longer term.
Cash generated by operations and a credit line are our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements.
To
fund our cash requirements in the ordinary course of business, we anticipate that we will continue to primarily rely on operating
cash flows, supplemented by our total cash and cash equivalents, together with the cash raised from the public offering of our
common stock conducted in April 2025. Our capital requirements, including but not limited to, servicing our lease obligations and fixed asset purchases,
will depend on many factors, including our growth rate and the timing and extent of operating expenses.
We
did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements involving commitments or
obligations, including contingent obligations, arising from arrangements with unconsolidated entities or persons that have or are reasonably
likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements or
capital resources.
As
the company expands in the India and South Asian market, the Company can expect a lower gross margin from sales in that cost sensitive
region. Further, the impact on margins will be offset by lower costs of sales, as the wages in that region are also lower than in the
U.S. Also, general economic conditions, the demand for the Company’s offerings and
changes in customer preferences in the future may have an impact on the revenue and income. In the future as the Company exhausts its
Net Operating Losses from the past, it will be expected to pay income taxes.
Debt
On
January 25, 2023, the Company entered into a three-year term loan with a local bank that is secured by substantially all assets of the
Company with a corporate guarantee given by subsidiary - FatPipe Networks Private Limited. The loan is repayable in full during the Fiscal
year 2025-26. The Company has received $2.5 million of the $5 million loan sanctioned by the bank. Interest rate is at current value
of index and additional 4.25% above the bank’s reference rate (interest rate per annum determined by bank as its three-year cost
of funds, at time of signing) which works out to 12% as on the reporting date.
In
November 2024, the Company received an additional $500,000 in proceeds from the bank pursuant to an additional draw.
In
March 2025, the Company obtained a $5 million term loan from Fortis Bank, of which $3 million was used to repay an outstanding loan from
the bank loan noted above. The Fortis Bank loan is repayable in 120 equal monthly installments commencing from March 1, 2025 and the
interest is charged at the Prime Rate plus 1%. The “Prime Rate” is the Prime Rate in effect on the first business day of
the month (as published in the Wall Street Journal newspaper) in which SBA received the application, or the first day of the month in
which any interest rate change occurs. The interest rate will be adjusted every calendar quarter (the “change period”) beginning
April 1, 2025 (date of first rate adjustment). The interest rate works out to 8.75% as on the reporting date. The loan is secured by
substantially all assets of the Company, certain personal properties of Directors of the Company, along with a personal guarantee given
by them and a Trust, where the directors are trustees. During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company made principal payments totaling
$27,913.

Operating
Activities
Net
cash used in operating activities in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, was $504,124 compared to $363,425 for the prior fiscal
year. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a lower net income driven by IPO-related expenses, partially offset by less cash
used in operating assets and liabilities than in 2024.
Investing
Activities
Net
cash used in investing activities in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, was $19,762, an increase of $574 compared to the prior fiscal
year due to higher investment in facilities.
Financing
Activities
Net
cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 was $2,485,739, an increase of $2,280,061 compared to the
prior fiscal year, primarily due to $2.5 million in net proceeds (after repayments) of debt.
Non-GAAP
Financial Measures
In
addition to our financial results determined in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”),
our management uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses to net income (“EBITDA”), a
non-GAAP measure, as a key measure in operating our business. We use EBITDA to make strategic decisions, establish business plans and
forecasts, identify trends affecting our business, and evaluate performance. For example, we use adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our
operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute
for, or a more meaningful measure than, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly
titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided below for adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable
financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measure and the reconciliation
of adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
In
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, our adjusted EBITDA decreased by $2,320,129 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to
a decrease in operating income and increase in IPO-related expenses.

Recurring
Billings from Monthly and Annual Subscriptions
Fatpipe
Annual and Monthly Recurring billings from products and services in 2025, excluding consulting services increased by 23%. This
reflects the continuing billings for existing customers as well as new business. In fiscal year 2023-24, the growth was 14% We
expect this growth in recurring billings to continue as sales staff, existing and new hires, book new contracts as well as renewals
of 36 month contracts from 2022 as they come due. The addition of the new cybersecurity product is expected to add to the new
revenues and recurring billings going forward
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
During
the years presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC rules.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
The
application of our accounting policies may require us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the accompanying disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates
and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the estimate
was made.
On
an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets, and deferred taxes. We base our estimates,
assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may materially differ from the results implied by these estimates and judgments under different assumptions
or conditions.
Intangible
Assets
Our
financial statements include IP-related intangible assets consisting primarily of legal and related costs associated with our patents
and capitalized lease obligations adjusted by accumulated amortization. The identification and recognition of those intangible assets
involve significant judgements, relating to, among other things, the projected cash flows attributable to these intangible assets and
the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets. We amortize intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated
useful lives. The useful lives are determined by management at the time of creation of the intangible assets and based on historical
experience and the economic life of the underlying technology and are regularly reviewed for appropriateness. We perform a quarterly
review of significant finitely lived identified intangible assets to make a judgement on whether facts and circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable and an impairment may be required.
These
reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such
as changes in our business strategy.
Deferred
Taxes
Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the combined
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We reduce the carrying amounts
of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will
not be realized. Use of the term “more likely than not” indicates the likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%.
Accordingly,
the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is continually assessed based on a more-likely-than-not realization
threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts
of profitability and taxable income, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with the utilization of operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards before expiration and tax planning strategies. In making such judgments, significant weight is given
to evidence that can be objectively verified.

Implications
of being an Emerging Growth Company
We
are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to
take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging
growth companies” including, but not limited to:
●
being
permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related disclosure in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this prospectus;
●
being
permitted to provide less extensive narrative disclosure than other public companies, including not being required to comply with
the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements;
●
being
permitted to utilize exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder
approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved;
●
being
permitted to defer complying with certain changes in accounting standards; and
●
being
permitted to use test-the-waters communications with qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors.
We
intend to take advantage of these and other exemptions available to “emerging growth companies.” We could remain an “emerging
growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of this
offering, (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of
our fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (which would occur if the market value of our equity securities that is held
by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter), or (iv) the
date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period.
The
JOBS Act permits an “emerging growth company” like us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new
or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable
to companies that comply with public company effective dates. This means that an “emerging growth company” can delay the
adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to delay such
adoption of new or revised accounting standards.
Smaller
Reporting Company
We
are also a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700
million as of the last trading day of our second quarter and our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed
fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is
less than $250 million as of the last trading day of our second quarter or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the
most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million as of the last
trading day of our second quarter. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may
continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. For example, as
a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation.

INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS’ REPORT
To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of FatPipe, Inc.
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of FatPipe, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March
31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income, statement of cash flows and statements
of stockholders’ equity, for each of the two fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2025, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2025, in conformity with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of United States of America (“US GAAP”).
Basis
for Opinion
These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The company is not required to have nor we have engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTE
1 : SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Company
Overview and Significant Accounting Policies
(A)
Company Overview
FatPipe
Inc. (“FatPipe” or the “Company” or “us” or “we” or “our”) is a leading developer
of enterprise-class, application-aware, secure software-defined wide area network (“SD-WAN”) solutions for organizations,
including enterprises, communication service providers, security service providers, government organizations, and other middle-market
companies.
FatPipe
holds thirteen software and technology patents, which it leverages through an integrated suite of software solutions to offer our customers
a reliable, accelerated and secure platform to support mission-critical applications running on cloud, hybrid cloud and on-premises networks.
Its core offerings include SD-WAN, secure access service edge (“SASE”), and network monitoring service (“NMS”)
software solutions, each of which is typically offered to customers as a subscription service. These solutions address a broad set of
network management needs and include an integrated set of capabilities designed to manage multi-line network traffic and routing.
FatPipe
sells in geographies around the world, with its largest customer populations located in the United States and South Asia. It plans to
continue expanding its presence throughout North America and parts of Southeast Asia.
Initial
Public Offering
On
April 7, 2025, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with D. Boral Capital LLC, as representative
(the “Representative”) of the underwriters named therein (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which the Company
agreed to sell to the Underwriters, in a firm commitment initial public offering (the “Offering”), an aggregate of 695,656
shares of the Company’s common stock, no par value per share (the “Common Stock”), at an initial public offering price
of $5.75 per share. The Common Stock was offered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-280925),
originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on July 19, 2024, as amended, and which
was declared effective by the Commission on February 12, 2025. A post effective amendment to the registration statement related to the
Offering was filed with the Commission on March 11, 2025, and which was declared effective by the Commission on March 17, 2025.
On
April 9, 2025, the Company closed the Offering and the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 791,024 shares of common stock. The total
gross proceeds to the Company from the Offering, which does not include a potential exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment
option, and before deducting discounts and expenses, were approximately $4,500,000. The Company received net proceeds of approximately
$3,700,000 pursuant to the Offering.
A
final prospectus relating to this Offering was filed with the Commission on April 7, 2025. The Common Stock was previously approved for
listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market and commenced trading under the ticker symbol “FATN” on April 8, 2025.
(B)
Significant Accounting Policies
Basis
of Preparation of Financial Statements
This
summary of significant accounting policies of FatPipe is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s consolidated financial
statements. The consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, which is responsible
for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (GAAP) and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date
of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
These
estimates are based upon information available through the date of the issuance of the financial statements and actual results could
differ from those estimates. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by the Company include, but are not limited to:
●
Fair
value of long-term debt and notes receivable.
●
Recognition
of revenue
●
Credit
loss on trade receivables and contract receivables.
●
Valuation
of inventory
●
Recoverability
of long-lived assets including intangible assets and their related estimated lives; and
●
Accruals
for estimated liabilities such as property tax accruals and litigation settlement accruals.
●
Accruals for income tax and deferred tax.
●
Determination
of standalone selling price of performance obligations for revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations.
F-7
Actual
results could differ from those estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable, which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Principles
of Consolidation
These
financial statements include the accounts of FatPipe, Inc. and its wholly and majority owned subsidiaries, FatPipe Technologies, Inc.
and FatPipe Networks Private Limited. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
As
of March 31, 2024, the Company owned 95.6% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of FatPipe Networks Private Limited (“Limited”)
and remaining 4.4% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Limited were owned by certain individual stockholders (collectively,
the “Limited non-controlling interests”). In July 2024, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase and sale agreement, the
Company issued an aggregate of 577,156 shares of common stock in exchange for the Limited non-controlling interests. As of March 31,
2025, Limited was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (see Note 3).
Reclassifications
Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Comprehensive
Income
Comprehensive
income includes net income as well as other changes in Stockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other
than those with stockholders.
Segment
Reporting
In
accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”), we identify our operating segments according to how our business
activities are managed and evaluated. The Company’s chief operating decision-maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who makes resource
allocation decisions and assesses performance based on financial information presented on an aggregate basis. There are no segment managers
who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-maker, or anyone else, for any planning, strategy and key decision-making regarding
operations. We have determined that each of our products and services share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics, and
therefore the results of our operating businesses are aggregated into one reportable segment. All of the operating businesses have met
the aggregation criteria and have been aggregated and are presented as one reportable segment, as permitted by ASC 280. We continually
monitor and review our segment reporting structure in accordance with authoritative guidance to determine whether any changes have occurred
that would impact our reportable segments.
Revenue
Recognition
Effective
January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Accounting Standard Updates (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers and the related amendments, which are codified into Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers., which establishes a broad principle that requires entities to assess the products or services promised
in contracts with customers at contract inception to determine the appropriate unit at which to record revenues, which is referred to
as a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers, at
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those products or services. The
new standard supersedes GAAP guidance on revenue recognition and requires the use of more estimates and judgments than the previous standards.
In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts
with customers.
ASC
606 may be applied either retrospectively or through the use of a modified-retrospective method. The full retrospective method requires
companies to recast each prior reporting period presented as if the new guidance had always existed. Under the modified retrospective
method, companies recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings at the date of initial application. The Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, on January 1, 2020,
using the modified retrospective method, the impact of which was not material to the Company.
To
determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance
obligation(s) in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s)
in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step
model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or
services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract was determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers, the Company assessed the goods or services promised within each contract and determined those that were
performance obligations, and assessed whether each promised good or service was distinct.
F-8
The
company recognizes three types of revenues as explained below;
Product
Revenue is for a network server running FatPipe software with contract term of 36 to 60 months. Each contract has a description of the
goods and services to be delivered, the term of the contract, and payment terms. We assess relevant contractual terms in our customer
contracts to determine the standalone selling price of each of the performance obligation. We apply judgment in identifying contractual
terms and determining the transaction price. The Company’s performance obligations are to transfer control of the software delivered
on a network server with customer-specific configurations. In addition, the Company provides technical support which includes implementation,
configuration and training services over the term of the contract. Additionally, as per the options for determining standalone selling
price in ASC 606-10-32-32 to 32-35, in respect to the contract with multiple performance obligations of delivery of software license
and technical support; including implementation into customer networks, configuration of the software, and training services to train
the customer on how to use the software, we have selected the cost of technical support personnel, plus a 20% margin for support services,
and the balance contract value as the standalone selling price for delivery of product and software license, so that it can be consistently
applied for each financial year.
The
contract’s initial term is non-cancellable and does not have a refund or cancellation provision. The customer enjoys the use of
the product and associated service for the Term in exchange for monthly payments or upfront payment made for the term of the contract.
The revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the software and network server to the customer or to staging when the customer
requests staging and custom configuration of the software and network server. The software license revenue in our product arrangements
is recognized at a point-in-time when the software solution has been delivered or ownership has been transferred.
The
service and support revenue is recognized over the term of the contract. An imputed interest charge is recognized in income using the
interest method in respect of the inherent interest arising from the payment terms. The balance sheet account “Contract receivable”
represents “Unbilled receivable” in connection with the revenue recognized upfront upon transfer of control of the software
and the network server to the customer. The same shall be transferred to Accounts Receivable on a monthly basis over the contract term.
Cash is received based on our payment terms which is typically 30-90 days.
We
provide service/support options for our customers. The first support option is 36 to 60 months paid monthly, or secondly, 12 months paid
upfront. For the 36-to-60-month service contracts paid monthly, the service revenue is recognized over the term of the contract. as discussed
above and is part of our product offering. The 12-month service option revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the 12-months,
and is referred to in the balance sheet as “Deferred Revenue”.
Our
service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting, we provide a broad range of service and support options to our
customers. Consulting agreements are usually of 12 months term with options to extend. We also provide comprehensive advisory services
that are focused on responsive, preventive, and consultative support of our technologies for specific networking needs. Total contract
term may be up to 5 years. Customers are billed monthly based on the hours expended on customers’ behalf. Revenue is recognized
on a monthly basis. Payment terms vary from 30 to 45 days from invoice date based on the customer/partner. In the below table, short
term RPO will be recognized over the next 12 months, while long-term RPO will be recognized over the 36-60 month term of the contracts.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. A hierarchy has been established for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes
the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data
obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions of what
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. The financial
and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The hierarchy is presented down into three levels based on the reliability of the inputs.
Level
1
Inputs
are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2
Observable
inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for the
full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level
3
Unobservable
pricing inputs that are less observable from objective sources or based upon our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities
at fair value, such as discounted cash flow models or valuations. The inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.
The
carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes payable and accrued liabilities are approximately fair value because
of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value because the debt is based
on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar maturities.
F-10
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
equivalents are generally comprised of certain highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
For
the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments with a maturity of less than
three months to be cash equivalents.
Trade
Accounts Receivable
Accounts
Receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Accounts receivables are due from various customers and are
shown net of applicable reserves for doubtful accounts as shown on the face of the balance sheet. There were no accounts that had been
placed on non-accrual status. The allowance for doubtful accounts has been estimated by management based on historical experience, current
market trends and, for larger customer accounts, their assessment of the ability of the customers to pay outstanding balances. Past due
balances and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. Changes in circumstances relating to the collectability
of accounts receivable may result in the need to increase or decrease the allowance for doubtful accounts in the future. The company
provides for any and all of the accounts receivable which are due over the period of one year if it meets the criteria for allowance
estimated by the management.
Inventories
Inventories
are recorded at lower of cost and net realizable value on the weighted average cost method of accounting.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures that increase value or extend useful lives are capitalized and routine maintenance and
repairs are charged to expense in the year incurred. Gains and losses from disposition of fixed assets are reflected in other income.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
SCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES
Furniture and fixtures
5 to 10 years
Office equipment and computers
3 to 5 years
Vehicles
5 years
Major
renewals and improvements are capitalized. Replacements, maintenance and repairs, which do not significantly improve or extend the useful
life of the assets, are expensed when incurred.
Upon
the sale or retirement of assets, costs and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any
gain or loss is included in the results of operations.
Intangible
Assets
Intangible
assets primarily consist of patent legal costs and are recorded at cost. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets which is assumed as 15 years. The Company capitalizes product development costs in accordance
with ASC 350-40 and ASC 985-20. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
which is assumed as 15 years.
Long-Lived
Assets
The
Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by determining whether there were any triggering
events that could impact the Company’s assets. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or
asset group may not be recoverable the Company performs a comparison of the carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected
to be generated by such asset or asset group. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss is measured based on the excess carrying
value of the asset over the asset’s fair value generally determined by estimates of future discounted cash flows.
The
Company has not identified any such impairment losses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024, and 2025.
Deferred
Offering Costs
Deferred
offering costs, consisting primarily of legal, accounting, and other third-party fees directly related to the Company’s proposed
securities offering, are recorded under other current assets on the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2025, the Offering had not yet closed,
and such costs remained deferred. The Offering was subsequently completed on April 9, 2025, and the deferred costs will be reclassified
and offset against the proceeds in the subsequent period.
F-11
Defined
Benefit Plan
The
subsidiary company “FatPipe Networks Private Limited” provides a defined benefit gratuity plan to eligible employees in accordance
with applicable labor laws of India. The gratuity benefit is based on the employee’s last drawn salary and years of continuous
service, and is payable upon resignation, retirement, or termination of employment.
The
gratuity plan is accounted for in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation—Retirement Benefits. The liability for the defined
benefit obligation is determined using the projected unit credit method and is based on actuarial valuations performed annually by independent
actuaries. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the statement of operations in the period in which they occur and
this method is applied consistently.
The
benefit obligation recognized in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as of the reporting
date. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligation reflects the yields available on high-quality corporate
bonds of similar duration. The Company does not fund the plan, and benefits are paid as they become due.
Key
assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include discount rate, salary growth rate, and employee turnover rates.
Income
Taxes
The
Company is subject to federal and state income taxes. Its taxable income and deductions are included on a consolidated income tax return.
The consolidated entities have a net loss carryover which may be fully utilized. Deferred tax assets are recognized in these financial
statements after considering valuation allowances. A subsidiary of the Company is subject to foreign income taxes in India. The Indian subsidiary is subjected to income tax audits annually and tax assessments in accordance with the applicable
Income Tax laws.
Warranties
The
Company offers a one-year to three-year warranty on the hardware products it sells. The cost of fulfilling the warranty obligation has
historically been insignificant. No provision for future warranty costs has been made in these financial statements.
Leases
The
Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases. Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are
classified as operating or financing leases, and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right of use asset and lease
liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s
incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right of use asset
is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right of use asset
result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term. For finance leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of
the right of use asset results in front-loaded expense over the lease term. Variable lease expenses are recorded when incurred.
In
calculating the right of use asset and lease liability, the Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components. The Company
excludes short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less from the new guidance as an accounting policy election, and recognizes
rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Related Parties
Related parties are any entities or individuals that, through employment,
ownership or other means, possess the ability to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Company. The Company
discloses related party transactions that are outside of normal compensatory agreements, such as salaries. The Company follows ASC 850,
Related Party Disclosures, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
Concentrations
The
Company has no significant geographic concentrations in either trade accounts receivable or revenue.

5: NOTE PAYABLE
On
January 25, 2023, the Company entered into a three-year term loan with a local bank that is secured by substantially all assets of the
Company with a corporate guarantee given by subsidiary - FatPipe Networks Private Limited. The loan is repayable in full during the Fiscal
year 2025-26. The Company has received $2.5 million of the $5 million loan sanctioned by the bank. Interest rate is at current value
of index and additional 4.25% above the bank’s reference rate (interest rate per annum determined by bank as its three-year cost
of funds, at time of signing) which works out to 12% as on the reporting date.
In
November 2024, the Company received an additional $500,000 in proceeds from the bank pursuant to an additional draw.
In
March 2025, the Company obtained a $5 million term loan from Fortis Bank, of which $3 million was used to repay an outstanding loan from
the bank loan noted above. The Fortis Bank loan is repayable in 120 equal monthly installments commencing from March 1, 2025 and the
interest is charged at the Prime Rate plus 1%. The “Prime Rate” is the Prime Rate in effect on the first business day of
the month (as published in the Wall Street Journal newspaper) in which SBA received the application, or the first day of the month in
which any interest rate change occurs. The interest rate will be adjusted every calendar quarter (the “change period”) beginning
April 1, 2025 (date of first rate adjustment). The interest rate works out to 8.75% as on the reporting date. The loan is secured by
substantially all assets of the Company, certain personal properties of Directors of the Company, along with a personal guarantee given
by them and a Trust, where the directors are trustees. During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company made principal payments totaling
$27,913.

action exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition to the action (other than the election of directors). The vote of a majority of
the shares of our common stock held by stockholders present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Meeting will
be sufficient to elect directors or to approve a proposal.

NOTE
7: LEASES
The
Company leases certain office space under operating leases. Lease commencement occurs on the date the Company takes possession or control
of the property. The original terms for facility related leases are generally between three to five years. Some of the Company’s
leases also include rental escalation clauses and/or termination provisions. Renewal options and termination options are included in
determining the lease payments when management determines the options are reasonably certain of exercise.
F-16
If
readily determinable, the rate implicit in the lease is used to discount lease payments to present value: however, substantially all
of the Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. When the implicit rate is not determinable, the Company’s
estimated incremental borrowing rate is utilized, determined on a collateralized basis, to discount lease payments based on information
available at lease commencement.
The
Company’s leases typically require payment of common area maintenance and real estate taxes which represent the majority of variable
lease costs. Certain lease agreements also provide for variable rental payments based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums,
usage measures, or changes in the consumer price index. Variable rent payments based on future performance, usage, or changes in indices
were not significant for any of the periods presented. Variable lease costs are excluded from the present value of lease obligations.
The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material restrictions, covenants, or any material residual value guarantees.

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
From
time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company, in conjunction with
its legal counsel, assesses the need to record liability for litigation or loss contingencies. A liability is recorded when and if it
is determined that such a liability for litigation or loss contingencies is both probable and estimable.
Although
the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management is of the opinion, after consulting legal
counsel, that the Company is not currently a party to any legal proceedings, which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.
At
this time, there are no legal proceedings that require the Company to assess the need to record a liability.
NOTE
12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:
On
April 7, 2025, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with D. Boral Capital LLC, as representative
(the “Representative”) of the underwriters named therein (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which the Company
agreed to sell to the Underwriters, in a firm commitment initial public offering (the “Offering”), an aggregate of 695,656
shares of the Company’s common stock, no par value per share (the “Common Stock”), at an initial public offering price
of $5.75 per share. The Common Stock was offered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-280925),
originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on July 19, 2024, as amended, and which
was declared effective by the Commission on February 12, 2025. A post effective amendment to the registration statement related to the
Offering was filed with the Commission on March 11, 2025, and which was declared effective by the Commission on March 17, 2025.
On
April 9, 2025, the Company closed the Offering and the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 791,024 shares of common stock. The total
gross proceeds to the Company from the Offering, which does not include a potential exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment
option, and before deducting discounts and expenses, were approximately $4,500,000. The Company received net proceeds of approximately
$3,700,000 pursuant to the Offering.
A
final prospectus relating to this Offering was filed with the Commission on April 7, 2025. The Common Stock was previously approved for
listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market and commenced trading under the ticker symbol “FATN” on April 8, 2025.
The
Company evaluated the subsequent events through June 30, 2025, the date at which the financial statements were issued.

9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and
is accumulated and communicated to our management, as appropriate, in order to allow timely decisions in connection with required disclosure.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. As required by Rule 13a-15(b)
or Rule 15d-15(b) promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes
in Internal Control
There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the year ended March 31, 2025, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, under the supervision of our Audit Committee. Our internal control over financial reporting is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on the framework in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment and
those criteria, management believes that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025.
Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls
Management
of the Company, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives
will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must
be considered relative to their costs. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or
by the collusion of two or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Board has held seven formal meetings and several informal meetings during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. All proceedings of the
Board taken at a formal meeting were evidenced by minutes taken at such meeting. All other matters approved by the Board outside of any
formal meeting were evidenced by resolutions consented to by all the directors. Such resolutions consented to in writing by the directors
entitled to vote on that resolution at a meeting of the directors are, according to the Utah Business Corporation Act (“UBCA”)
and our Bylaws, valid and effective as if they had been passed at a meeting of the directors duly called and held.

Governance and Nominating Committee

Equity Incentive Plan
Our
2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) governs equity awards to our employees, directors, consultants and other eligible
participants. The Plan reserves a total of 2,600,000 shares of common stock (the “Share Reserve”). The Share Reserve is subject
to an annual increase on April 1st of each fiscal year, in an amount equal to 3% of the total number of shares of common stock
outstanding. Incentive awards generally may be issued to officers, key employees, consultants, and directors and include the grant of
nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance
shares and performance units.
Pension,
Retirement or Similar Benefit Plans
There
are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension, retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers. We have
no material bonus or profit-sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive
officers, except that stock options may be granted at the discretion of the Board or a committee thereof.
Indebtedness
of Directors, Senior Officers, Executive Officers and Other Management
None
of our directors or executive officers or any associate or affiliate of our Company during the last two fiscal years is or has been indebted
to our Company by way of guarantee, support agreement, letter of credit or other similar agreement or understanding currently outstanding.
Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
During
the majority of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, we did not have a Compensation Committee or another committee of the Board of directors
performing equivalent functions. Instead, the entire Board performed the function of Compensation Committee. Our Board approved the executive
and director compensation updates, with the entire Board acting as the Compensation Committee. Updated compensation is as disclosed in
this registration statement on Form S-1. Prior to the closing of this offering, the Board will establish a Compensation Committee comprised
of the following directors: Bobby Majumder, and Jean Turgeon.
Compensation
Committee Report
As
the Compensation Committee has not yet been formed, it did not, during the fiscal year March 31, 2025, hold any meetings and therefore
there is no compensation committee report. The Compensation Committee Charter, which will be adopted by the Board to govern the Compensation
Committee, will be available on our website at www.fatpipe.com.
