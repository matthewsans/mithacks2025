BUSINESS
BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW
Earth
Science Tech, Inc. (“ETST” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April
23, 2010, and subsequently redomiciled to the State of Florida on June 27, 2022. As of November 8, 2022, ETST operates as a strategic
holding company, focused on value creation through the acquisition, operational optimization, and management of its operating businesses.
The Company’s current operations include compounding pharmaceuticals, telemedicine and real estate development through its wholly
owned subsidiaries: RxCompoundStore.com, LLC (“RxCompound”), Peaks Curative, LLC (“Peaks”), Avenvi, LLC (“Avenvi”),
Mister Meds, LLC (“Mister Meds”), and Earth Science Foundation, Inc. (“ESF”). Subsequent to the reporting period,
the Company acquired 100% of Las Villas Health Care, Inc. (“Villas”), DOConsultations, LLC (“DOC”), and an 80%
interest in MagneChef (“Magne”).
RxCompound,
based in Miami, Florida, is a fully licensed compounding pharmacy authorized to fulfill prescriptions in the following states and territories:
Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Wisconsin and Puerto Rico. RxCompound is actively pursuing licensure
in the remaining U.S. states.
Peaks
is a telemedicine referral platform offering asynchronous consultations for Peaks-branded compounded medications prepared at RxCompound
and Mister Meds. The platform operates in states where either pharmacy is licensed. Through the development of its own healthcare provider
network, MyOnlineConsultation.com, and ongoing licensure expansion for both pharmacies, Peaks aims to offer services nationwide. In addition,
the company has recently expanded into the veterinary market through the acquisition of Zoolzy.com.
Avenvi
is a diversified real estate company engaged in development, asset management, and financing. With a growing portfolio of real estate
holdings, Avenvi provides turnkey solutions from development to end-user financing. It also manages investment activities for ETST and
oversees the Company’s ongoing $5 million share repurchase program.
Mister
Meds, acquired on October 1, 2024, is in Abilene, Texas. The pharmacy received full compounding licensure in March 2025. It operates
out of a 5,000 sq. ft. facility owned by Avenvi and includes advanced sterile compounding capabilities with both positive and negative
pressure environments, as well as hazardous drug handling. Mister Meds is currently applying for licensure in states not yet serviced
by RxCompound.
ESF,
a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization incorporated on February 11, 2019, is the charitable arm of ETST. ESF accepts grants and donations
to assist individuals who need financial support for prescription costs at both RxCompound and Mister Meds.
Villas
is a brick-and-mortar healthcare facility dedicated to the Spanish speaking community. Our expert-led services include advanced sexual
health treatments, and customized solutions to enhance physical performance. We combine compassionate, personalized care with clear,
trustworthy education—empowering you to take control of your health with confidence.
DOC
was born with a passion to modernize the availability and delivery of home therapies. DOConsultations providers tailor a medication plan
around your health and wellness goals and follow up with our patients to ensure results, while our partner pharmacies conveniently ship
directly to your door.
MagneChef
is a direct-to-consumer retail brand. Utilizing its patents and intellectual properties, the company aims to develop new products that
can be marketed and sold online. Currently, the company has developed products for cooking. MagneChef is in the process of expanding
its product line for new offerings that incorporate its intellectual property.
Current
Operations
CORPORATE
STRATEGY
The
company is a holding company focused on value creation through the acquisition, operational optimization, and management of its operating
businesses. The Company’s areas of focus include pharmaceutical compounding, telemedicine, real estate development, and direct
to consumer products.
The
Company’s strategic approach centers on resource integration across its subsidiaries to create operational efficiencies. Through
its subsidiaries RxCompound and Mister Meds, the Company operates licensed compounding pharmacies offering both sterile and non-sterile
preparations. These services are supported by Peaks and DOC, which facilitate asynchronous telemedicine consultations and prescription
generation across the Company’s operating footprint. As of the date of this filing, the Company is pursuing additional licensure
to expand pharmacy and telehealth operations nationwide.
4
In
parallel, the Company is engaged in the development and management of real estate assets through Avenvi. Avenvi’s operations provide
infrastructure support to ETST’s pharmacies and facilitate real estate-related and other investment strategies, including the management
of the Company’s share repurchase program. Additionally, Avenvi provides turnkey development and financing solutions to property
buyers.
The
Company continues to diversify its holdings through strategic acquisitions. During the reporting period and subsequent thereto, the Company
acquired 100% of Villas, which provides specialized wellness services including sexual health treatments tailored to the Spanish-speaking
market, and 80% of Magne, a consumer brand focused on patented direct-to-consumer products. These acquisitions are intended to diversify
ETST’s presence in targeted demographic and product segments.
The
Company’s nonprofit subsidiary, Earth Science Foundation, Inc. (“ESF”), supports access to prescription medications
through donation-based programs that help subsidize prescription costs for qualifying patients.

and internal cross-brand promotion.
Pharmacy
and Telehealth Services
Marketing
for RxCompound, Mister Meds, Peaks, and DOConsultations target licensed healthcare providers, prospective patients, and affiliated businesses.
These efforts include direct-to-consumer (DTC) outreach through digital channels such as search engine optimization (SEO), email marketing,
and social media advertising. Additionally, the Company develops partnerships with fitness centers, wellness clinics, and medical offices
to promote its compounded medications and asynchronous telehealth consultations.
Real
Estate Services
Avenvi’s
marketing initiatives are centered around its turnkey development services and financing capabilities. Marketing is conducted through
industry relationships and project-specific campaigns designed to attract buyers for its properties.
Consumer
Products
MagneChef
products are marketed directly to consumers through online marketplaces, brand-specific e-commerce channels, and social media platforms.
The Company employs influencers, video content, and paid media to promote product features and patented innovations. Marketing efforts
highlight the safety, durability, and functional design of the products, with a focus on high-heat cooking, grilling, and professional
kitchen use.
The
Company adheres to all applicable advertising regulations across its marketing channels, including those governing the promotion of health-related
products and services. Marketing compliance is reviewed internally and through third-party consultants to reduce regulatory risk and
ensure alignment with corporate messaging.
COMPETITION
The
Company operates in multiple sectors and faces competition from a variety of companies, ranging from large, established organizations
to smaller, specialized service providers.
Compounding
Pharmacies
RxCompound
and Mister Meds compete with other compounding pharmacies, including regional and national operators offering both sterile and non-sterile
formulations. Competitive factors in this segment include licensure coverage, quality assurance standards, turnaround times, customer
service, pricing, and the ability to produce customized formulations. The market is highly regulated, and compliance with USP <795>,
<797>, and <800>, where applicable, standards are a key differentiator. The Company believes its growing licensure footprint,
investment in advanced compounding infrastructure, and integration with affiliated telehealth platforms provide a competitive advantage.
6
Telemedicine
Services
Peaks
and DOC operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive telehealth market. Key competitors include national telehealth platforms,
vertically integrated pharmacy services, and digital health startups offering asynchronous or synchronous care. Competitive factors include
platform accessibility, provider availability, regulatory compliance, pricing, and brand reputation. The Companies differentiate themselves
by offering proprietary compounded medications.
Real
Estate Development and Investment
Avenvi
operates in the real estate development and investment sector, which is highly competitive and influenced by market cycles, interest
rates, and geographic demand. Avenvi competes with local and national developers, institutional investors, and private equity firms.
Competitive advantages include Avenvi’s ability to manage both project development and investment oversight in-house.
Consumer
Products
MagneChef
competes with established brands in the kitchen and grilling accessory market, including companies with significant brand recognition,
marketing budgets, and retail distribution. The Company competes based on innovation, product safety, and durability. The MagneChef product
line is distinguished by its patented magnetic release mechanism and high-heat protection features.
Across
all business segments, the Company’s ability to compete effectively depends on its continued investment in operational scalability,
regulatory compliance, customer service, and innovation. The Company expects competitive pressures to intensify as regulatory frameworks
evolve, and new market entrants emerge.
EMPLOYEES
As
of March 31, 2025, the Company has 76 employees. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining
agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

1A. RISK FACTORS
A
description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and ownership of our Class A common stock is set forth below.
You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including
our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.” The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our Class
A common stock could decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also
impair our business operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors,
including the risks described below. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
7
Summary
of Principal Risk Factors
●
Our
results of operations, as well as our key metrics, may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may result in our failing
to meet the expectations of industry and securities analysts or our investors.
●
If
we are unable to expand the scope of our offerings, including the number and type of products and services that we offer, the number
and quality of healthcare providers serving our customers, and the number and types of conditions capable of being treated through
our platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
●
If
we are unable to successfully market to new customers and retain existing customers, or if evolving privacy, healthcare, or other
laws prevent or limit our marketing activities, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.
●
We
operate in highly competitive markets and face competition from large, well-established healthcare providers and more traditional
retailers and pharmaceutical providers with significant resources, and, as a result, we may not be able to compete effectively.
●
Our
brand is integral to our success. If we fail to effectively maintain, promote, and enhance our brand in a cost-effective manner,
our business and competitive advantage may be harmed.
●
Our
pharmacy business subjects us to additional healthcare laws and regulations beyond those we face with our telehealth business and
increases the complexity and extent of our compliance and regulatory obligations.
●
If
we fail to comply with applicable healthcare and other governmental regulations, we could face substantial penalties, in which case
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be required to restructure our
operations.
●
Evolving
government regulations and enforcement activities may require increased costs or adversely affect our results of operations.
●
Security
breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or customers or prevent
us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.
●
We
may be subject to legal proceedings and litigation, including intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could
materially harm our business and results of operations.
●
We
may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
●
Our
Series B class Preferred stock structure has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Chief Executive Officer and Director,
Giorgio R. Saumat, which limits an investor’s ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change
in control.
●
The
market price of our common stock may be volatile.
8
Risks
Related to Peaks, RxCompound, Mister Meds Business, DOC, and Villas
Our
limited operating history and evolving business model make it difficult to evaluate our current performance or predict our future results.
Because we are a relatively young company with a developing business model, investors may have limited information on which to base an
investment decision. As we continue to grow and expand into new markets and offerings, our prospects must be considered in light of the
risks and uncertainties associated with a developing company in a rapidly evolving industry.
If
we are unable to expand the scope of our offerings, our business and financial results may suffer. Our ability to grow depends on expanding
the number and types of products and services we offer, increasing the number and quality of healthcare providers on our platform, and
broadening the range of treatable conditions. If we fail to do so, our ability to attract and retain customers, generate revenue, and
compete effectively may be materially and adversely affected.
Failure
to attract and retain customers may materially harm our business. Our growth depends on acquiring and retaining customers through marketing
efforts and platform engagement. If our marketing strategies fail to generate sufficient awareness or demand, or if changes in privacy,
healthcare, or marketing regulations limit our outreach, our revenue and overall performance could be negatively impacted.
Misuse
or mismanagement of social media and influencer marketing may expose us to reputational and regulatory risk. While social media and celebrity
influencers can enhance brand recognition, any misuse, inappropriate associations, or failure to comply with advertising regulations
could lead to reputational damage, customer loss, and potential fines or penalties.
Our
brand is integral to our competitive position, and any deterioration in brand equity could harm our business. We rely heavily on brand
strength to differentiate ourselves in the market. If we fail to effectively promote, protect, or maintain our brand, our reputation
could suffer, negatively impacting customer acquisition, retention, and partnership opportunities.
If
our offerings fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Failure to meet customer
expectations or differentiate our services from competitors could result in slower growth, lower revenue, and reduce investor confidence.
We
operate in a nascent and rapidly evolving market that may be difficult to predict. Our core business model, particularly through Peaks,
DOC, and Villas, operates in emerging areas of telehealth and wellness. The competitive landscape is dynamic and includes risks related
to regulatory changes, industry consolidation, and shifts in consumer behavior, all of which may affect demand forecasting and business
planning.
Technological
innovations and alternative solutions may reduce demand for our services. Advancements in digital health, diagnostics, or pharmaceutical
therapies could render our offerings less attractive or obsolete, affecting customer retention and revenue.
We
face competition from larger, better-capitalized companies. Many of our competitors include large healthcare systems, retail pharmacies,
and pharmaceutical manufacturers with greater brand recognition, operational scale, and financial resources, which may limit our ability
to compete effectively.
9
The
conduct of affiliated healthcare providers may expose us to liability and reputational harm. Our reputation and legal standing may be
affected by the actions of healthcare professionals affiliated with Peaks, DOC, Villas, RxCompound, or Mister Meds. Any unethical or
noncompliant conduct may result in legal exposure or loss of trust in our platform.
Poor
customer support may damage our reputation and financial performance. A failure to provide effective support to patients and providers
may lead to dissatisfaction, complaints, and erosion of customer loyalty, which could impair our competitive position and revenue.
Acquisitions
and strategic investments could fail to deliver expected benefits and may introduce additional risks. We may pursue acquisitions or strategic
partnerships to accelerate growth, but such transactions carry risks related to integration, unforeseen liabilities, operational disruption,
and dilution to existing shareholders.
Macroeconomic
conditions may negatively affect demand for our services. Economic downturns, inflation, or disruptions in the healthcare or real estate
markets may reduce consumer spending or investor confidence, thereby impacting our financial performance.
Our
mobile experience is critical to user engagement and retention. A significant portion of users interact with our platform via mobile
devices. Any issues with mobile functionality, performance, or compatibility may impair our ability to retain and grow our customer base.
We
rely on uninterrupted internet and mobile network access to operate our platform. Any outages or interruptions in internet or cellular
connectivity could disrupt service availability, reduce customer satisfaction, and harm our reputation. Failures, delays, or breaches
by these vendors may impair our ability to provide services, fulfill prescriptions, or maintain operational continuity.
Supply
chain disruptions could affect product availability and customer satisfaction. Delays or shortages in the supply of pharmaceutical ingredients,
packaging, or delivery services could affect our ability to meet demand and damage our brand.
Pharmacy
operations are subject to complex healthcare regulations and heightened compliance risk. RxCompound and Mister Meds must adhere to a
wide array of state and federal pharmacy regulations, including those beyond telehealth services. Noncompliance could result in fines,
license suspensions, or legal action.
We
rely on third-party payment processors and must comply with evolving payment regulations. Any failure in payment processing systems or
regulatory compliance could interrupt transactions, harm user experience, and reduce revenue.
Inaccurate
or ineffective pricing strategies could hinder our competitiveness. If our pricing does not reflect market dynamics or customer expectations,
we may face reduced demand, margin compression, or lost opportunities for partnership growth.
Our
business depends on the leadership team’s continuity and expertise. The loss of key executives or inability to recruit
experienced leadership could impair our ability to execute on strategy and manage daily operations effectively.
Our
growth relies on attracting and retaining skilled employees. An inability to hire or retain qualified personnel may constrain our innovation
capacity, operational execution, and scalability.
We
rely on centralized inventory locations for order fulfillment. Our inventory is currently housed at RxCompound’s
facility in Miami, Florida and Mister Meds’ facility in Abilene, Texas. A disruption, natural disaster, or facility damage at either
site could materially impair our ability to fulfill orders and meet customer expectations.
10
Risks
Related to Avenvi Business
Market
volatility could affect asset values and returns. Avenvi’s real estate assets are influenced by macroeconomic factors
such as inflation, interest rates, and regional market conditions. A downturn could lead to reduced valuations, delayed projects, and
lower development returns.
Development
projects carry execution and cost risks. Delays, cost overruns, zoning or environmental issues, and changing market demand may affect
the success and profitability of Avenvi’s development projects.
Limited
access to financing could constrain Avenvi’s growth. Avenvi’s ability to pursue and complete
development projects depends on access to capital and credit. Rising interest rates or unfavorable lending terms may limit its ability
to fund future activities.
Avenvi’s
performance is closely tied to ETST’s strategic direction. As Avenvi manages investments for Earth Science Tech,
Inc., changes in ETST’s strategic priorities or liquidity—such as decisions surrounding the $5 million share
repurchase program—may affect Avenvi’s operations and outcomes.
Regulatory
compliance burdens may increase costs or delay projects. Avenvi’s operations are subject to various zoning, disclosure,
tax, and environmental regulations. Changes in these laws may increase compliance costs or restrict development opportunities.
Shifts
in demand may affect project success. Changes in real estate demand—particularly due to economic trends or remote work—may
reduce demand for Avenvi’s residential or commercial developments.
Reputational
risks may result from underperformance or mismanagement. Failure to meet development expectations or mismanagement of capital—especially
in relation to ETST’s resources—may result in reputational damage or increased scrutiny from shareholders and
regulators.
Risks
Related to MagneChef Consumer
We
may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights, including those associated with Magne. The Magne product line depends on patented
technologies and trademarked branding. Failure to enforce or maintain these rights may result in loss of exclusivity, brand dilution,
or increased competition.
Product
liability or safety issues related to Magne could result in reputational harm or legal exposure. If any Magne product is found to be
defective, unsafe, or misused, we may face product recalls, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or consumer dissatisfaction that adversely
impacts sales and brand equity.
Magne
operates in a competitive consumer goods market with limited barriers to entry. Larger companies with established distribution, pricing
power, or marketing budgets may limit our ability to gain or maintain market share.
Shifts
in consumer behavior may impact demand for Magne products. Changes in household spending patterns, cooking trends, or consumer preferences
could reduce demand and impact overall product performance.
Risks
Related to Governmental Regulation
We
are subject to extensive, complex, and evolving government regulations. Our operations—particularly those involving RxCompound,
Mister Meds, Peaks, DOC, and Villas—are subject to a broad range of federal, state, and local regulations governing healthcare,
pharmacy operations, telemedicine, and patient privacy. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial penalties,
operational restrictions, or reputational harm. Regulatory requirements may change without notice, potentially requiring significant
expenditures to ensure compliance.
Noncompliance
with federal or state healthcare laws could result in civil or criminal penalties. If any of our business practices are found to violate
anti-kickback statutes, false claims laws, HIPAA, or other healthcare-related laws, we could face fines, exclusion from federal healthcare
programs, or other enforcement actions that materially affect our operations.
11
Changes
in healthcare policy and reimbursement structures could impact our business model. Modifications to federal or state healthcare programs,
insurance coverage mandates, or telehealth reimbursement policies may affect customer access, demand for our services, or the financial
viability of our offerings.
Our
pharmacy operations are subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny. RxCompound and Mister Meds must comply with numerous state pharmacy
board regulations, DEA requirements for controlled substances, and FDA rules for compounded medications. Any violation—whether
intentional or inadvertent—could result in license suspension, fines, or criminal investigation.
Evolving
telemedicine regulations create compliance uncertainty. As telehealth laws continue to evolve across jurisdictions, we must adapt to
inconsistent requirements around prescribing, physician licensure, patient consent, and recordkeeping. Failure to keep pace with these
changes may limit our geographic reach or lead to regulatory violations.
Privacy
and data protection laws may impose additional burdens on our business. We are subject to HIPAA and other federal and state privacy laws
governing the collection, storage, and transmission of personal health information. Breaches or noncompliance may result in fines, litigation,
and loss of customer trust.
Future
regulatory developments may increase compliance costs or restrict operations. Emerging policies—such as new FDA oversight of compounded
drugs, increased scrutiny of health tech platforms, or restrictions on influencer marketing in healthcare—could materially affect
how we conduct business.
Risks
Related to Intellectual Property and Legal Proceedings
We
may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect proprietary
technologies, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property associated with our brands, including Magne. If we fail to adequately
secure or enforce our rights, we may lose competitive advantages, experience brand dilution, or face increased competition.
Third
parties may infringe on our intellectual property or challenge its validity. Unauthorized use or misappropriation of our intellectual
property could harm our reputation and market position. In some cases, we may be forced to initiate costly and time-consuming legal proceedings
to protect our rights or defend against infringement claims.
We
may be subject to claims alleging intellectual property infringement. As we expand our offerings, there is a risk that third parties
may allege that our technologies, branding, or marketing strategies infringe on their intellectual property rights. Even if such claims
lack merit, they could lead to litigation, financial liabilities, or reputational damage.
Litigation
or regulatory investigations could materially impact our operations. We may be involved in legal proceedings or regulatory actions in
the normal course of business, including those related to employment practices, patient care, privacy violations, product liability,
or contractual disputes. Any such proceedings could result in substantial costs, diversion of management attention, or adverse judgments.
We
may not be adequately insured against certain legal risks. While we maintain liability and business insurance, coverage may be unavailable
or insufficient for certain types of intellectual property claims, regulatory actions, or class-action lawsuits. This may result in out-of-pocket
expenses that adversely affect our financial position.
Settlement
obligations or adverse rulings could affect financial results. If we are required to settle a legal claim or if a court issues a judgment
against us, we could face significant financial liabilities or operational restrictions, which may materially affect our business and
results of operations.
12
Risks
Related to the Company, Results of Operations, and Additional Capital Requirements
The
Company has a history of net losses, anticipates increasing expenses in the future, and may not be able to maintain profitability.
The
Company’s results of operations, as well as our key metrics, may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may result in
failure to meet the expectations of industry and securities analysts or its investors.
Peaks
relies significantly on revenue from customers purchasing subscription-based prescription products and services and may not be successful
in expanding its offerings.
The
requirements of being a public company have strained and may continue to strain the Company’s resources, divert management’s
attention, and may result in litigation.
The
Company may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at
all.
If
the Company’s estimates or judgments relating to its significant accounting policies prove to be incorrect, the results of operations
could be adversely affected.
Adverse
tax laws or regulations could be enacted, or existing laws could be applied to the Company or to customers, which could subject us to
additional tax liability and related interest and penalties, increase the costs of the Company’s offerings, and adversely impact
our business.
Certain
U.S. state tax authorities may assert the Company has a state nexus and seek to impose state and local income taxes which could harm
the results of operations.
Risks
Related to Ownership of the Company Securities
Trading
in our common stock on the Pink Exchange has been subject to wide fluctuations.
Our
common stock is currently quoted only on the OTC Pink Marketplace, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.
The
regulation of penny stocks by SEC and FINRA may discourage the tradability of our securities.
Florida
law, our Articles of Incorporation, and our by-laws provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors at our expense, and
correspondingly limits their liability, which may result in a major cost to us and hurt the interests of our shareholders because corporate
resources may be expended for the benefit of officers and/or directors.
We
do not intend to pay cash dividends on any investment in the shares of stock of our Company and any gain on an investment in our Company
will need to come through an increase in our stock’s price, which may never happen.
Because
our securities are subject to penny stock rules, you may have difficulty reselling your shares.
Our
common stock market prices may be volatile, which substantially increases the risk that investors may not be able to sell their Securities
at or above the price that was paid for the security.
Because
we may issue additional shares of our common stock, investment in our company could be subject to substantial dilution.
FINRA
sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.
The
issuance of shares to enter acquisitions may have a significant dilutive effect.

3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From
time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we may become involved in legal proceedings seeking monetary damages or other remedies.
The ultimate outcome and potential liability, if any, arising from such matters cannot be predicted. As of the date hereof, there are
no pending or, to our knowledge, threatened legal actions against us, our officers, or directors in their official capacities, or involving
our properties, that, in the opinion of management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results

Salaries
expense increased from $4,358,917 for the year ended March 31, 2024, to $14,115,643 for the year ended March 31, 2025. The company has
experienced significant growth and therefore the need to increase employee count to support operations and administration.
Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased from $166,976 to $4,154,976, this increase was necessary and anticipated as the company
experienced exponential growth.
Marketing
expenses totaled $836,860 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $811,577 from $25,283 for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2024. This increase is primarily related to the Company promoting online sales through social media marketing and search engines.
Bank
charges were $1,066,577, this is related to merchant fees, associated with the increase in sales.
Legal
and professional fees totaled $305,932 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $1,468,250 from $1,774,182 for the prior
period ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in legal and professional fees is due to reclassification of territory managers fees to the
category of selling, general and administrative.
We
are a smaller reporting company, as defined by 17 CFR § 229.10(f)(1). We do not consider the impact of inflation and changing prices
as having a material effect on our net sales and revenues and on income from our operations for the previous two years or on continuing
operations going forward.
INTEREST
EXPENSE
Interest
expenses decreased to $21,189 in the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2025, compared with $67,207 in Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2024.
INCOME
TAX
Estimated
taxes were calculated using the 2025 federal tax rate of 21%. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included
in the financial statements. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences
are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date.
NON-GAAP
FINANCIAL MEASURES
We
use Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner
that adjusts from their equivalent GAAP measures or that supplements the information provided by our GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA is
defined by us as EBITDA (net income (loss) plus depreciation expense, amortization expense, interest and income tax expense, minus income
tax benefit), further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash expenses and other adjustments as set forth below. We use Adjusted EBITDA
because we believe it clearly highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial
measures, since Adjusted EBITDA eliminates from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance.
20
We
use Adjusted EBITDA in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this Annual Report, and believe that
Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater
transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone.
In addition, we believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in making period-to-period comparison of results because
the adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance.
Adjusted
EBITDA is not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures
used by other companies. We encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated
financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.

REPORT

To
the Board of Directors and
Stockholders
of Earth Science Tech, Inc.
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Earth Science Tech, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (the Company) as of March 31,
2025, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended March 31,
2025, and the related consolidated notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2025 and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for year ended March 31, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
We
did not identify any critical audit matters that need to be communicated.

NOTE
2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of presentation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“US GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
F-7
Principles
of consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include all the accounts of the Earth Science Tech, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries
RxCompoundstore, Peaks, Avenvi, and Mister Meds (collectively, the “Company”). All intercompany transactions have been eliminated
during consolidation.
Use
of estimates and assumptions
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. The areas requiring significant estimates are impairment of goodwill, provision for taxation, useful life of depreciable
assets, useful life of intangible assets, contingencies, and going concern assessment. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed
on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
The
Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use
and eventual disposition of the assets. If the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value, an impairment loss is recognized
in the amount of the excess. No impairment losses were recognized for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Cash
and cash equivalents.
Cash
and cash equivalents include all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less, As of March 31, 2025,
the Company’scash balance exceeded federally insured limits by approximately $607,620. The Company maintains its cash with high-credit-quality
financial institutions and has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant
credit risk with respect to these balances.
Accounts
Receivable.
Accounts
receivable are carried at their contractual amounts, less an estimated allowance for credit losses. Management estimates the allowance
for credit losses using a loss-rate approach based on historical loss information, adjusted for management’s expectations about
current and future economic conditions, as the basis to determine expected credit losses. Management exercises significant judgment in
determining expected credit losses. Key inputs include macroeconomic factors, industry trends, the creditworthiness of counterparties,
historical experience, the financial conditions of the customers, and the amount and age of past due accounts. Management believes that
the composition of receivables at year-end is consistent with historical conditions as credit terms and practices and the client base
has not changed significantly. Receivables are considered past due if full payment is not received by the contractual due date. Past
due accounts are generally written off against the allowance for credit losses only after all collection attempts have been exhausted.
As of March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company had not recorded an allowance for credit losses, as management determined that no reserve
was necessary based on its assessment of the collectability of outstanding balances and the credit quality of its customers.
Revenue
recognition
In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies performance obligations, by transferring promised
goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange
for fulfilling those performance obligations. Revenue for product sales is recognized at point of sale or upon shipment, depending on
the terms of the arrangement.. There are no contract assets or contract liabilities and therefore no unsatisfied performance obligations.
F-8
Equity
Investments at fair value
The
Company accounts for its equity securities in accordance with ASC 321, Investments – Equity Securities, as amended by ASU 2016-01,
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are
measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period in which they occur.
The
following summarizes the aggregate cost and fair value of the Company’s equity securities as of March 31, 2025 and 2024:

Disaggregated
Revenue
In
accordance with ASC 606, the Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by category — core and non-core - as it
believes it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.
The
Company’s disaggregated revenue by category is as follows:

income of $9,123 and $0. These amounts are not included in revenue from contracts with customers and are classified separately in
other income.
As
of March 31, 2025, the Company had three significant customers, accounting for approximately 7%, 10% and 9% of revenue. Total accounts
receivable balances for these three customers were as follows:

F-9
Inventory
Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory consists primarily
of finished goods.
The
Company evaluates inventory for excess and obsolescence based on factors such as current inventory levels, estimated product life cycles,
historical and forecasted customer demand, and input from the product development team. When necessary, a reserve is recorded to reduce
the carrying value of inventory to its estimated net realizable value. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed at least annually
and updated as needed based on the Company’s business plans and market conditions.
Cost
of Goods Sold
Components
of cost of goods sold include product costs, consumables, shipping costs to customers and any inventory adjustments.
Shipping
and Handling
Costs
incurred by the Company for shipping and handling are included in costs of goods sold.
Income
taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period, which includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of or all the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on
the date of enactment.
Earnings
per share
The
Company follows ASC 260 to account for earnings per share. Basic earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net
results from operations by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings
per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for
the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, if any, using the treasury stock method.
For
the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same because the Company had no potentially dilutive
securities outstanding during those periods.
F-10
Goodwill
Goodwill
represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase business combination.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of goodwill may be impaired. In conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first reviews qualitative factors to determine
whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that
the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a quantitative assessment, and the fair value
of the reporting unit is determined by analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of the reporting
unit continues to exceed its fair value, the fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is calculated and an impairment loss equal
to the excess is recorded.
Stock
Based Compensation
The
Company applies the fair value method of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, in accounting for its stock-based compensation. These
standards state that compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the
service period, which is usually the vesting period, if any. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the
fair value of its stock, stock option and warrant issuance. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the
date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a few complex
and subjective variables. These variables include the Company’s expected stock price, volatility over the term of the awards, actual
employee exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. No stock-based commitments were outstanding as of March
31, 2025, and 2024.
Fair
Value
FASB
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”) establishes a framework for all fair value measurements
and expands disclosures related to fair value measurement and developments. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820
requires that assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
Level
1 — Quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable inputs,
Level
2 — Significant other observable inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data; and
Level
3 — Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data.
The
carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, such as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other liabilities,
approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.
As
of March 31, 2025, all of the Company’s investments were classified as Level 1 and were measured at fair value using quoted market
prices in active markets.
The
fair value of the Company’s debt approximates its carrying value as of March 31, 2025 and 2024. Factors that the Company considered
when estimating the fair value of its debt included market conditions, liquidity levels in the private placement market, variability
in pricing from multiple lenders and terms of debt.
Property
and equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred; additions, renewals and
betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation
are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation on property and equipment is charged
using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 5 years.
F-11
Recently
issued accounting pronouncements
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments, as modified by FASB ASU No. 2019-10 and other subsequently issued related ASUs. The amendments in this Update
affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, and any other financial assets that have the contractual right to receive cash. The
ASU requires an entity to recognize expected credit losses rather than incurred losses for financial assets. The amendments in this Update
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted
this new guidance effective January 1, 2023 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of this standard did
not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, but did change how the allowance for credit losses
is determined.
In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires
public entities to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis and provide in interim
periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The ASU does
not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative threshold to determine
its reportable segments. The new disclosure requirements are also applicable to entities that account and report as a single operating
segment entity. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted the guidance for the annual reporting period ended December 31, 2024. There was
no impact on the Company’s reportable segments identified.
Intangible
assets
Intangible
assets consist of the Peaks telemedicine platform, the Holding Company’s web domains, and Mister Meds LLC’s software and
domain. These intangible assets are considered to have finite useful lives and are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated
useful life of five years.
The
Company reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not
be recoverable. If such indicators exist, the Company compares the carrying amount of the asset to the expected undiscounted future cash
flows. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. No impairment losses were recognized
for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

NOTE
5- LEASES
The
Company treats a contract as a lease when the contract conveys the right to use a physically distinct asset for a period in exchange
for consideration, or the Company directs the use of the asset and obtains substantially all the economic benefits of the asset. These
leases are recorded as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease obligation liabilities for leases with terms greater than 12
months. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the entirety of the lease term. Lease liabilities
represent the Company’s obligation to make payments over the life of the lease. A ROU asset and a lease liability are recognized
at commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments over the life of the lease. Initial direct costs are included
as part of the ROU asset upon commencement of the lease. Since the interest rate implicit in a lease is generally not readily determinable
for the operating leases, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The incremental
borrowing rate represents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar lease
term to obtain an asset of similar value.
The
Company reviews the impairment of ROU assets consistent with the approach applied to the Company’s other long-lived assets, assessing
recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company elected the practical
expedient to exclude short-term leases (leases with original terms of 12 months or less) from ROU asset and lease liability accounts.
The Company has elected not to apply the other transition practical expedients available under ASC 842.
The
Company’s leases are classified as operating leases. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.

ASC
740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. This first step is to evaluate the tax position
for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the
largest amount which is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating
and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately anticipate actual
outcomes.
F-18
The
Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained
on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated
financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement. As of March 31, 2025, the Company has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits.
The
Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and operating
expenses, respectively. As of April 1, 2024, the Company had $0 unrecognized tax benefits and $0 charges during fiscal 2025,
and accordingly, the Company did not recognize any interest or penalties during fiscal 2025 related to unrecognized tax benefits. There
is $0 accrual for uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2025.
As
of March 31, 2025, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward (“NOL”) for federal and state income tax purposes of
approximately $5,457,000. Of this amount, $5,336,541 is from pre-2018 and $120,459 from post 2018. NOLs generated pre-2018 can be carried
forward for 20 years and post-2018 NOLs do not expire, but are limited to offset up to 80% of taxable income in any future period.
Internal
Revenue Code Section 382 (“Section 382”) imposes limitations on the availability of a company’s net operating losses
after certain ownership changes occur. Section 382 limitation is based upon certain conclusions pertaining to the dates of ownership
changes and the value of the Company on the dates of the ownership changes. It was determined that an ownership change occurred in October
2013, and March 2014. The amount of the Company’s net operating losses incurred prior to the ownership changes is limited based
on the value of the Company on the date of the ownership change. Management has not determined the amount of net operating losses generated
prior to the ownership change available to offset taxable income after the ownership change.
NOTE
15 – SEGMENT REPORTING
The
Company operates as a single reportable segment, as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), the Chief Executive Officer
(“CEO”), evaluates the business on a consolidated basis and does not receive discrete financial information for multiple
business units.
Measure
of Segment Profit or Loss
The
CODM assesses the Company’s financial performance based on operating income, which aligns with the amount reported in the statement

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS & PROCEDURES
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
must be considered relative to their costs. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions.
The
Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness
of the Company’s design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated
under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual Report on Form 10-K/A. Based on that review and evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual report,
the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2025.
Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our
disclosure controls and procedures contain components of our internal controls over financial reporting. Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s
principal executive and financial officer and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company.
Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the Company; and
Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
The
Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation
Date. In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). The COSO framework is based upon five integrated
components of control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communications and ongoing monitoring.
25
Based
on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, Company management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act were ineffective as of the Evaluation Date based on the number of adjustments
from the audit. The Company will continue to improve its internal controls, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
On
September 29, 2023, the Company adopted a new compensatory arrangement for its executive officers, which superseded the prior plan. Under
this arrangement, Giorgio R. Saumat, the Company’s CEO and Chairman of the Board, was entitled to receive twenty-one percent of
the Company’s monthly revenue. Mario G. Tabraue, the Company’s COO and a member of the Board of Directors, was entitled to
receive ten and one-half percent of the Company’s monthly revenue. This arrangement commenced on October 1, 2023, for a twelve-month
term. Compensation was payable on the first day of each month based on the revenue generated in the preceding month, provided the Company
increased its cash position on a quarter-over-quarter basis. In the event the Company failed to increase its cash position in a given
quarter, the arrangement was subject to renegotiation, and no payments would be made at the beginning of the subsequent quarter. On August
15, 2024, the Board of Directors approved new twelve-month employment agreements for both the CEO and the COO, effective October 1, 2024.
Pursuant to these agreements, the CEO was entitled to receive eighteen percent of the Company’s monthly cash receipts, while the
COO was entitled to receive twelve percent. As with the prior arrangement, payments were contingent upon the Company achieving a quarter-over-quarter
increase in net profit. If net profit did not increase for a given quarter, the agreements would require renegotiation, and no payments
would be made at the beginning of the following quarter. On December 30, 2024, the CEO and COO entered into an amendment to their respective
employment agreements, which was approved by the Board of Directors and became effective January 1, 2025. Under the amended terms, the
CEO receives a fixed monthly salary of two hundred thousand dollars, and the COO receives a fixed monthly salary of one hundred fifty
thousand dollars. In addition to their base salaries, and in lieu of any stock-based compensation, both officers are eligible to receive
quarterly performance bonuses, provided the Company’s total assets increase by at least five percent on a quarter-over-quarter
basis. If this performance threshold is met, the CEO is entitled to a bonus equal to ten percent of the Company’s revenue for the
preceding quarter, and the COO is entitled to a bonus equal to seven percent of the Company’s revenue for the same period. Additionally,
in their capacities as members of the Board of Directors, the CEO and COO are entitled to receive four thousand dollars for each Board
meeting attended.
On
March 4, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors appointed Ernesto L. Flores as Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Gabrielle Schuster.
Mr. Flores receives an annual base salary of one hundred sixty thousand dollars, paid on a biweekly basis. He is eligible for milestone-based
bonuses, as well as a year-end discretionary bonus determined by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. On December 26, 2024, Mr.
Flores was elected to the Company’s Board of Directors and appointed as a member of the Audit and Compensation Committees. In this
capacity, he is entitled to receive compensation of four thousand dollars for each Board meeting attended. On March 11, 2025, the Board
of Directors and the Compensation Committee approved the continuation of Mr. Flores’s compensation arrangement and added performance-based
bonuses, with amounts to be determined at the sole discretion of the Chief Executive Officer.
On
April 16, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors appointed Christopher Rose as the Company’s Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”).
Mr. Rose will receive an annual base salary of two hundred seventy thousand dollars, payable on a biweekly basis. In addition, he will
be eligible to receive milestone-based bonuses and may be considered for a discretionary year-end bonus, as determined by the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer. On March 11, 2025, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee approved the continuation of Mr. Rose’s
compensation arrangement and added performance-based bonuses, the amounts of which will be determined at the sole discretion of the Chief
Executive Officer.
Victoria
Losada, the Company’s Secretary elected in late 2023, receives compensation of five hundred dollars for each Board meeting attended
in her capacity as Secretary. On December 26, 2024, Ms. Losada was also elected as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors
and appointed as a member of the Compensation Committee, entitling her to an additional four thousand dollars for each Board meeting
attended in that role.

ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
As
of March 31, 2025, we had outstanding 295,347,903 shares of common stock. Each share of common stock is currently entitled to one vote
on all matters put to a vote of our stockholders. The following table sets forth the number of common shares, and percentage of outstanding
common shares, beneficially owned as of the date hereof by:
●
each
person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of our outstanding common stock;
●
each
of our current directors;
●
each
our current executive officers and any other persons identified as a “named executive” in the Summary Compensation Table
above; and
●
all
our current executive officers and directors as a group.
30
Beneficial
ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and includes general voting power and/or investment power with respect
to securities. Shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of options or warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within
60 days of the record date, and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of other securities currently convertible or convertible
within 60 days, are deemed outstanding for computing the beneficial ownership percentage of the person holding such securities but are
not deemed outstanding for computing the beneficial ownership percentage of any other person. Under the applicable SEC rules, each person’s
beneficial ownership is calculated by dividing the total number of shares with respect to which they possess beneficial ownership by
the total number of outstanding shares. In any case where an individual has beneficial ownership over securities that are not outstanding
but are issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants or similar rights within the next 60 days, that same number of shares is added
to the denominator in the calculation described above. Because the calculation of each person’s beneficial ownership set forth
in the “Percentage Beneficially Owned” column of the table may include shares that are not presently outstanding, the total
sum of the percentages set forth in such a column may exceed 100%. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each of the following persons
is 8950 SW 74th CT Suite 1401, Miami, FL 33156, USA, and, based upon information available or furnished to us, each such person
has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares set forth opposite his, her or its name.

Rule
13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. That rule provides that
a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who directly or indirectly has or shares voting power and/or investment power with
respect to such security. Rule 13d-3 also provides that a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who has the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of such security within sixty days, including through the exercise of any option, warrant or conversion of a security.
Any securities not outstanding which are subject to such options, warrants or conversion privileges are deemed to be outstanding for
the purpose of computing the percentage of outstanding securities of the class owned by such person. Those securities are not deemed
to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of the class owned by any other person.
There
were no grants of stock options since inception to March 31, 2025. We do not have any long-term incentive plans that provide compensation
intended to serve as an incentive for performance.
The
Board of Directors of the Company has not adopted a stock option plan. The company has no plans to adopt one but may choose to do so
in the future. If such a plan is adopted, this may be administered by the board, or a committee appointed by the board (the “Committee”).
The Committee would have the power to modify, extend, or renew outstanding options and to authorize the grant of new options in substitution
therefor, provided that any such action may not impair any rights under any option previously granted. The Company may develop an incentive-based
stock option plan for its officers and directors and may reserve up to 10% of its outstanding shares of common stock for that purpose.
